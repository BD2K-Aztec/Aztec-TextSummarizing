ABSTRACT

Motivation: An observed metabolic response is the result of the
coordinated activation and interaction between multiple genetic
pathways. However, the complex structure of metabolism has meant
that a compete understanding of which pathways are required to
produce an observed metabolic response is not fully understood. In
this article, we propose an approach that can identify the genetic
pathways which dictate the response of metabolic network to
specific experimental conditions.

Results: Our approach is a combination of probabilistic models for
pathway ranking, clustering and classification. First, we use a non-
parametric pathway extraction method to identify the most highly
correlated paths through the metabolic network. We then extract
the defining structure within these top-ranked pathways using both
Markov clustering and classification algorithms. Furthermore, we
define detailed node and edge annotations, which enable us to track
each pathway, not only with respect to its genetic dependencies, but
also allow for an analysis of the interacting reactions, compounds
and KEGG sub-networks. We show that our approach identifies
biologically meaningful pathways within two microarray expression
datasets using entire KEGG metabolic networks.

implementation of our proposed method is currently available from

1 INTRODUCTION

Coordinated gene expression along speciﬁc pathways determines
which metabolic compounds can be synthesized and, therefore, can
be used to infer the function of an entire network. Much of the
networked structure of metabolism has already been identiﬁed and
is readily available through databases such as KEGG (Kanehisa and
Goto, 2000). These databases reveal that even for simple organisms,
the complete metabolic network is large and highly complex. This
mixture of network size and complexity is sufﬁcient to hide the key
pathways, which deﬁne the response of the metabolic network to
external stimuli. Consequently, models of global metabolic networks

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

are required to identify the speciﬁc pathways that are driving an
observed metabolic response.

Metabolism of speciﬁc models such as network expansion
(Handorf et al., 2005), ﬂux balance analysis (FBA; Smolke,
2010) and constraints-based modeling (Price et (11., 2003) model
the Chemical properties of metabolic networks. The simplest of
these, network expansion, uses the natural limits imposed by the
stoichiometry of each reaction to identify the scope of a each
compound within the network. The goal of network expansion is to
determine a minimum set of compounds required to fully reproduce
the entire network. FBA and constraint-based models are explicit
physical models of the Chemistry that control metabolic networks.
Physical models of metabolism explicitly model the ﬂux through
the reactions in order to predict the amount of each compound
being produced during an experiment. Both physical models and
network expansion approaches focus heavily on the Chemical
properties of the metabolic network and do not directly consider
the genetic component of a metabolic network. Extensions to these
approaches to include a genetic effect within model have been
proposed (Ebenhoh and Liebermeister, 2006; Shlomi et (11., 2008).
However, these extensions are limited to binary representations of
gene expression and do not consider relationships within the gene
expression along pathways or within subnetworks.

A considerable amount of research has been undertaken to
identify the genetic factors, which dictate the function of metabolic
networks (Karp et al., 2010; Mlecnik et al., 2005). Of particular
note are methods relating to gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA;
Subramanian et al., 2005), which seek to identify known groups
of genes that have a non-random response to an external stimulus.
GSEA methods identify important groups of genes by ﬁrst
ranking all genes using test statistics such as t-tests or correlation
coefﬁcients, and then testing to see if speciﬁc groups are at the
top or bottom of the ranked list. However, GSEA methods rely on
the structure of simple test statistics that do not explicitly use the
known networked structure of genes. Furthermore, they can only
indicate which large pre-speciﬁed groups of genes are important
and do not allow for partial responses where only some genes within
these known groups are related the observed response.

Machine learning methods such as graph-based kernels (Rapaport
et al., 2007) or penalized approaches (Li and Li, 2008; Zhu et al.,
2009) overcome the limitations of GSEA and use feature selection
to identify functional network components. However, neither graph
kernels nor penalized approaches can strictly enforce that the
features identiﬁed are logically connected within the network, and
therefore may produce results that are difﬁcult to justify biologically.
Probabilistic network models such as those described in Wei and
Li (2007) and Sanguinetti et a1. (2008) can enforce these features

to be logically connected within the metabolic network. However,
these methods require an assumption of a discrete gene expression
distribution that may not completely reﬂect the underlying biology.

Our approach conceptually lies between GSEA and probabilistic
models as we assume very little about the structure of the gene
expression data but enforce the identiﬁed components to be logically
connected within the network. We propose a combination of three
complementary methods we have previously developed and have
proven to be successful in analyzing small metabolic sub-networks.
First, we use a non-parametric pathway ranking method (Takigawa
and Mamitsuka, 2008), and perform an exhaustive search to identify
the top K most coordinated genetic pathways in response to speciﬁc
experimental conditions. Our path ranking method assumes that the
ﬁinctional components of a metabolic network will possess a highly
correlated pathway structure. Then, if any functional components
exist the top-ranked pathways will be a Clustered list of small
pathway variations through these components. Pathway ranking is
similar to GSEA; however, it explicitly uses the network structure,
does not require the speciﬁcation of prior groups of genes, and makes
no assumption on the distribution of the gene expression.

Pathway ranking has been shown to extract biologically
meaningful pathways in small metabolic sub-networks (Takigawa
and Mamitsuka, 2008). However, as the network size increases, to
ensure we are extracting all biologically relevant structure, we must
also increase the number of pathways to be extracted. However,
extracting large numbers of pathways, in the order of 1000s, prevents
an easy interpretation of the result. Therefore, extending pathway
ranking to global metabolism requires further tools to identify the
deﬁning structures within the resulting pathway list.

To identify the deﬁning features within the set of top-ranked
pathways, we propose both a Clustering and a Classiﬁcation
algorithm. Both proposed algorithms exploit the natural Markov
structure of a pathway. The pathway Clustering algorithm is 3M
(Mamitsuka et al., 2003), which identiﬁes pathways that possess
the same underlying sequence of functional genes. The pathway
Classiﬁer, HME3M (Hancock and Mamitsuka, 2009) employs
the same framework as 3M but restricts the pathway search
to identify those pathways that deﬁne a speciﬁc experimental
condition. Both 3M and HME3M have been previously shown
to identify biologically signiﬁcant pathways on metabolic sub-
networks (Hancock and Mamitsuka, 2009; Mamitsuka et al., 2003).
However, these previous implementations employed a gene activity
deﬁnition, which required the extraction of all possible pathways
between single start and end compounds within the network. Clearly,
this approach of extracting all possible pathways through global
metabolic networks is infeasible. Therefore, by using the pathways
identiﬁed by the path ranking method, we are upscaling both 3M
and HME3M to analysis of global metabolic networks.

Both 3M and HME3M provide a probability estimate that each
edge is a member of an identiﬁed functional component within the
metabolic network. Furthermore, in this article we deﬁne detailed
node and edge annotations that allow for an analysis of each pathway
with respect to its core genetic dependencies and can scale up
to include an analysis of interacting reactions, compounds and
KEGG sub-networks. These annotations allow for the analysis of
the structure within each identiﬁed ﬁinctional component to be
performed at multiple biologically meaningful resolutions. In this
article, we show the combination of pathway ranking with Markov
Clustering and Classiﬁcation models is scalable to the analysis

of complete metabolic networks. The results will highlight the
ﬂexibility of our combined approach and show that it identiﬁes
biologically meaningful pathways within real microarray expression
data in both unsupervised and supervised settings.

2 METHODS
2.1 Deﬁning metabolic pathways

In metabolic networks, the same gene can be found in multiple locations
within the network, can catalyze different reactions and, therefore, can
possess multiple biological functions. When deﬁning a pathway through
a metabolic network the location of each gene denotes a speciﬁc function
and must be precise. We deﬁne the speciﬁc location of each gene within
the metabolic network through node and edge annotations extracted from
the KEGG database (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000). Our annotations (1) deﬁne
each gene as a node within the network. Each gene is annotated by its gene
code (G), reaction (R) and KEGG pathway membership (P). Additionally,
as the edge between two genes connects two reactions within the metabolic
network, it is identiﬁed by the ﬁrst substrate compound (C p); the product
compound from the ﬁrst reaction (CM); ﬁnal product compound (C T); and the
ﬁnal KEGG pathway membership of CT, (PT). These annotations allow for
transparent tracking of each pathway through the entire metabolic network:
nodes:=(G,R,P); edges:=(Cp,CM,CT,P). (1)
Using the annotations in (l), we deﬁne a genetic pathway through a
metabolic network to be a connected sequence of genes g that extend between
speciﬁed start (5) and end compounds (t) (2).
f (gag/(+1)

f<gk—1agk) f<gk+1agk+2)

 

--t (2)

labelk_1 label;C +1 labelk+1
In (2), labelk are the edge annotations in (l) and f(gk,gk+1) is a function
indicating the strength of the relationship between gk and gk+1.

Our pathway deﬁnition requires the speciﬁcation of start 5 and end nodes
t, which are entry and exit compounds of the metabolic network. In previous
analysis, we deﬁned these nodes to be speciﬁc compounds of interest within
a small metabolic sub-network (Hancock and Mamitsuka, 2009; Takigawa
and Mamitsuka, 2008). However, these do not need to be single compounds.
Therefore, to extend our original approach to analyze global metabolic
networks we deﬁne s to be all compounds with edges only leading into
the network, and we deﬁne t to be all compounds without edges leading
into the network. Additionally, we note a slight limitation of our pathway
approach for the case where multiple substrates are combined by a single
reaction to produce multiple products. In this situation, all possible pairwise
combinations of the multiple substrate and products are added to the network,
and then treated separately by the path ranking procedure.

Furthermore, each edge is weighted by functions, f (gk, gk+ 1), which
measure the strength of the relationship between gk and gk+1. The
speciﬁcation of the weight function is ﬂexible with the condition that
increasing values of the f indicate stronger relationships between gk and
gk+1. As the accuracy f is paramount to the path ranking method in this
work we deﬁne f to be median Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient between gk
and gk+1 over 100 bootstrapped replications.

A key assumption of our pathway deﬁnition is that correlated gene
expression directly relates to the function of a metabolic network. It should
be noted here that it is not the mRNA as measured by microaIray analysis
that performs the metabolic functions but the related proteins. Additionally,
it is well established that mRNA expression do not always correlate well
with protein abundance as it ignores key biological mechanisms and features
such as post-translational modiﬁcation and sub-cellular location (Gygi at al. ,
1999). However, in general, highly abundant proteins are also likely to show
high mRNA expression levels (Ghaemmaghami at al., 2003). Although the
correlation between global gene expression and protein abundance is unclear,
by identifying paths of maximum correlated gene expression we are focusing
only on regions within the metabolic network where the expression signal is
strong and are, therefore, more likely to possess a speciﬁc biological function.

2.2 Pathway ranking

Probabilistic pathway ranking identiﬁes the most probable paths through a
metabolic network between speciﬁed 5 and t by solving a K -shortest and
loop-less path problem on a weighted network (Takigawa and Mamitsuka,
2008). Our path ranking method is a non-parametric method as it does
not specify the functional form of the edge weights, f(gk,gk+1) (2), but
instead considers the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) over
all edge weights within the network. In this work, as we deﬁne the edge
weights to be the correlation between two genes and the ECDF is simply a
probabilistic rank for the most positively correlated genes. Therefore, path
ranking is identifying the top K pathways of maximal correlation through
the metabolic network. Furthermore, the probabilistic nature of the ECDF
edge weights allow for a signiﬁcance test to determine if a path contains any
functional structure or is simply a random walk (Takigawa and Mamitsuka,
2008).

Due to the high levels of redundancy within metabolic networks, it is
likely that any pathway ranking procedure will be biased towards short paths
consisting of the same gene. Therefore, to ensure that we extract informative
paths through global metabolic networks we include two control parameters.
First, a parameter to control the minimum number of genes can be set to
remove the numerous small and biologically uninteresting pathways from the
pathway set. No maximum path length is set. Second, biological redundancy
creates chains of reactions that are catalyzed by similar or identical gene
sets. Therefore, there are multiple edges within the network where the same
gene is connected to itself. As the correlation along these edges will be 1 it
is clear that pathways consisting largely of the same gene will dominate the
list of extracted pathways. To reduce the effect of the same gene edges, we
deﬁne a user-speciﬁed penalty p on all edges, which connect the same gene.
We assign the edge correlation, f(gk, gk+1), for all same gene edges to the
speciﬁed p value. Setting p allows for explicit control over the diversity of
genes selected within the extracted pathway list.

To show the scalability of the path ranking procedure to global metabolism
in Figure 1, we present running times for analysis of the entire KEGG yeast
metabolic network using the Gasch microarray data (Gasch at al., 2000)
and a same gene penalty of p20. Figure 1 shows the effect on the running
time of the path ranking algorithm at various control parameter settings and
network sizes. The minimum path length is set to [2,6, 10], number of paths
to be extracted is set to K =[1000,5000, 10000] and the network size is
increased in terms of number of genes (nodes) until the entire KEGG yeast
metabolic network is analyzed. The experiments were performed in R (Ihaka
and Gentleman, 1996) running on an desktop PC (Intel Core i7 2.66GHz
CPU,12 GB of RAM).

These experiments clearly show that increasing all parameter values will
increase the running time of the path extraction procedure. The maximum

run time of ~850 s (<15 min) for realistic settings, (10000 paths of 310
genes, entire KEGG yeast metabolic network), shows reasonable practical
performance of our path ranking method. This performance observed on a
desktop PC shows the scalability of our path ranking method to analyze
entire metabolic networks.

2.3 3M pathway clustering

The 3M Markov mixture model (Mamitsuka at al., 2003) provides the core
framework for both our pathway clustering and classiﬁcation models. 3M
explicitly uses the Markov structure over all extracted pathways to identify
the functional components. The 3M model identiﬁes M key functional
pathway components through a mixture of ﬁrst-order Markov chains

M K

pm = Z n,,,p(slel,,,)1‘[p(gk. label}. lgk—i ; 61....) (3)
111:] k:2

where 71m is the probability of each component and each component is
deﬁned by the transition probabilities 9km, p(si|91m) the probability of the
start compound si es and p(gk,labelk| gk_ 1:610”) the probability of a path
traversing the edge labelk linking genes gk_1 and gk. From the pathway
deﬁnition (2), every path starts at node 5 and ﬁnishes at t. Therefore, the
start compound, 5, is the same for all pathways and the probability of the
start compound p(s|61m) becomes 1 for all components.

The 3M model is simply a mixture model and as such its parameters
are conveniently estimated by an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm
(Mamitsuka at al., 2003). The result of 3M is M components each deﬁned
by 6", = {95% [62,", . . .,9,,,,,...,6T,,,]} where 6",, are the probabilities of each
gene within each component. The identiﬁed components correspond to a
cluster of frequently observed pathways that have a similar structure. The
parameters 6", are probabilities for each gene within each component and,
therefore, directly correspond to the importance of each gene within each
identiﬁed functional component.

2.4 HME3M pathway classiﬁcation

An extension to the 3M for classiﬁcation is available through the HME3M
model (Hancock and Mamitsuka, 2009). HME3M uses an hierarchical
mixture of experts (HME; Jordan and Jacobs, 1994) to create a classiﬁcation
model directly from the 3M model. To supervise 3M an additional term,
p(y|X,/3m) is added to each functional component within (3) to include
information from known experimental groups

M K

my IX) = Z mnpolx. 18...) 11mg). . label}. lgk—i :91...) (4)
111:] k:2

where y is a binary response variable and X a binary matrix where each
column is a gene, each row is a pathway and a cell value of 1 indicates the
inclusion of a particular gene along a speciﬁc path. The parameters 71,”, 9km
and [3», are estimated simultaneously with an EM algorithm (Hancock and
Mamitsuka, 2009). The additional term p(y|X, [3,") is simply a classiﬁcation
model, which takes as input the binary pathway matrix X weighted by
the EM component probabilities and returns the posterior probabilities for
classiﬁcation of the response variable y. To ensure a scalable and interpretable
solution, HME3M uses a penalized logistic regression for each component
classiﬁer.

The goal of HME3M is to identify a set of pathways that can be used
to classify a particular response label, y, e y. However, as we know the
response variable a priori we can optimize performance of the HME3M
model by directing the path ranking algorithm through network components
that are differently expressed over the response labels. This can be done by
normalizing the ECDF edge weights of the path ranking method across all
response labels. To do this normalization step, we ﬁrst compute the ECDF
edge weights for each label, )1), independently, and get PEw(gk, gk_1 , y =yl).
Normalizing exploits the probabilistic nature of the ECDF edge weights,

PEw, and divides each PEw(gk,gk_1,y=yl) by the sum over all response
labels (5).

PEw(gk.gk—1.y=yl)
PEW(gkvgk—1Iy=y1)= Z (5)

yey,PEw(gk~gk—1~y=ﬂ) .

We then use PEw as the edge weights and extract the K most likely
pathways that are speciﬁc to each response label. The process of normalizing
the edge weights will highlight edges that display a difference in correlation
over response labels. Normalizing the edge weights is useful for supervised
analysis where the goal is to identify pathways speciﬁc to each response
label; however, it is not suitable for unsupervised analyses where the goal is
to identify clusters of pathways with a similar structure.

2.5 Software

A complete implementation of our combined approach can be found
within our provided R package PathRanker. PathRanker provides all
functions to process the KEGG metabolic network, overlay a microaIray
dataset, extract the K most-correlated metabolic pathways, and analyze
the key functional components within these pathways. PathRanker’s
functions are completely ﬂexible allowing for either an analysis of the
complete KEGG network or more tailored analysis of pathways between
speciﬁc compounds and KEGG pathway groups. Multiple visualization
options are also provided allowing the user to interpret the results at each
stage of the analysis. PathRanker will soon be submitted to CRAN and is
currently available from http://www.bic.kyoto-u.ac.jp/pathway/timhancock.

3 EXPERIMENTS

We evaluate our combined methodology on two microarray
datasets constructed with differing experimental objectives. The
ﬁrst microarray is the benchmark Gasch microarray (Gasch et al.,
2000), which observes the genetic response of yeast to numerous
environmental stress conditions. Our goal is to identify which
stress conditions have similar pathway responses. The second is
a microarray observing the genetic differences between equally
obese patients who are insulin resistant versus those who are
insulin sensitive (Yang et al., 2002). Insulin resistance is a known
metabolic hallmark of Type II diabetes. Our goal in this analysis
is to identify speciﬁc pathway differences between insulin resistant
and sensitive patients. The microarray datasets were obtained from
GEO (Gasch=GSE18, diabetes: GSE121).

3.1 Metabolic proﬁling of yeast stress responses

Before analysis of the Gasch microarray, pre-processing of the
experimental conditions was performed to merge the several original
heat shock experiments into one response label ‘Heat Shock’.
This merging process did not include the ‘Reverse Heat Shock’.
Furthermore, all the experiments concerning cell-cycle factors
and strain comparisons were removed due to small numbers of
observations. This left 13 stress conditions, and therefore we use
3M to identify 13 functional components, M = 13.

We construct our experiment to highlight path similarities among
the stress conditions. We estimate the network edge weights for
each stress condition independently and extract the top 1000 paths
(K: 1000) with a same gene penalty set to highlight diverse paths
(,0: 0). To ﬁnd the optimum 3M model, we vary the minimum path
length from 1 to 10 genes. The quality of the 3M Clustering for
each minimum path length setting is evaluated using a 5-fold cross-
validated Normalized Mutual Information (NMI).

stress conditions for speciﬁed minimum path lengths.

Figure 2 displays the minimum path optimization curve for 3M
Clustering of the Gasch yeast stress conditions. Clearly, lengthening
the minimum path length yields a pronounced improvement in 3M
Clustering results. Figure 2 reveals the action of the minimum path
parameter to remove small noise pathways that are observed across
multiple stress conditions. Only after these small noise pathways
have been removed, the ﬁinctional components of each stress
condition can be accurately identiﬁed. From Figure 2, the optimal
Clustering performance is observed to be at a minimum path setting
of nine genes. We now set the minimum path parameter to nine
genes and analyze the Clustering results.

The structure of the 3M model for Clustering the Gasch yeast stress
conditions is presented in Figure 3. Figure 3 contains two tables
where the right table is a heat map of the Clustering confusion matrix
with the known stress conditions on the top axis and the 3M Cluster
labels on the right axis. The numbers within each cell are the number
of pathways for each stress condition that occur within each 3M
Cluster. The left table is a heat map of the pathway structure for each
3M component. The top axis shows the KEGG metabolic pathways,
compounds and reactions, the bottom axis shows the genes. The
number within each cell is probability of each gene within each 3M
component. To improve the Clarity of the display in Figure 3, all
6 parameters less than 0.3 were removed and then only columns
with more than one valid 6 parameter were retained. The complete
image is presented in Figure 1 of the Supplementary Material. From
observation of the conﬁision matrix and the component similarities
in Figure 3, we identify six related components with common
structure. We now discuss each separately.

3.1.] (M1, M2, M3): Heat shock, hypo-osmotic shock, DTT,
amino-acid starvation, diamide The stress conditions of heat
shock, hypo-osmotic shock, dithiothreitol (DTT), amino-acid
starvation and diamide are grouped together as they share common
components across starch and sucrose metabolism, fructose and
mannose metabolism and the pentose phosphate pathway. The
main common reaction path is from C00267 (a-D-glucose) to
C00018 (pyridoxal phosphate) through C00794 (Sorbitol), C00095
(D—fructose), C05345 (ﬂ-D-fructose 6-phosphate) and C00118
(glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate). Despite this large common element,
3M is able to distinguish three sub-Clusters, which group DTT with
amino acid starvation, hypo-osmotic stress with heat shock and lastly
diamide exposure. These pathway differences occur mainly within
starch and sucrose metabolism.

is known to be regulated by the Hoglp-MAP pathway (Sunnarborg

et al., 2001) that is known to be activated under osmotic stress

conditions and heat shock (Mollapour and Piper, 2006).

The (DTT, amino acid starvation) (M1) Cluster is deﬁned by a
edge from a-D—glucose to C00103 (D-glucose 1-phosphate) by the

YPR184W gene. YPR184W is induced by Gcn4p, which is a key

regulator expressed during amino acid starvation in yeast (Natarajan

One striking feature common to all M1, M2 and M3 is the use of
the gene YPR184W (GDB 1). YPR184W is a glycogen debranching

et al., 2001). Gcn4p is also known to regulate genes relating to the

unfolded protein response initiated by DTT exposure (Patil et al.,

2004). Therefore, the similarity between the DTT and amino acid
starvation stress responses is likely due to Gcn4p regulation.

enzyme (reaction R02109), which catalyzes the conversion from

YPR184W is different in each component. M1 uses YPR184W
to convert a-D—glucose into starch and then interacts YPR184W

separately. The similarity between diamide, heat shock, DTT agrees

with observation by Gasch et al. (2000). The unique component
of the diamide response is largely deﬁned by the conversion

to convert starch to a-D—glucose, and then interacts YPR184W

Mining metabolic pathways through gene expression

 

3.1.2 (M4, M5, M6): steady state and carbon sources The
similarity of steady-state growth and alternate carbon sources is
expected, as both relate to steady-state growth with either different
carbon sources or at different temperatures (Gasch et al., 2000).
The backbone of this group is the KEGG one carbon pool by
folate pathway from (C00101) tetrahydrofolate (THF) to C00143
(5,10-methylene-THF).

When yeast is grown under steady-state conditions at various
constant temperatures (M4) the one carbon pool by folate pathway
is entered in through C00101 (THF). THF is a by-product of
tRNA metabolism which converts C01647 (tRNA) to C02430 (L-
methionyl-tRNA) and then to THF. The observation that genes
relating to RNA processing are active during steady-state growth
agrees with observations by Li et al. (2000).

Otherwise, when grown on differing carbon sources (M5,M6)
the one carbon pool by folate pathway is through C00143 (5,10-
methylene-THF) by a reaction series, which converts C00979
(O-acetyl-L-serine), C00097 (L—cysteine), C00022 (pyruvate),
C00065 (serine) to 5,10-methylene-THF. The one carbon pool by
folate pathway is used to regulate the production of 5, 10-methylene-
THF in the presence of excess glycine (Piper et al., 2000). As the
amount or glycine and serine produced increases when yeast is
grown in rich carbon sources (Pasternack et al., 1994), the regulation
of the production 5,10-methylene-THF becomes necessary and is
identiﬁed by 3M in pathway clusters M5 and M6.

3.1.3 (M7): nitrogen depletion Nitrogen depletion is found to
have a very speciﬁc response, which is a coordinated chain of
reactions from C00568 (4-aminobenzoate) to C00078 (tryptophan)
or C00234 (10-formyl-THF) through folate biosynthesis, the one
carbon pool by folate pathway, methane metabolism and the glycine,
serine and threonine pathway. The importance of the one carbon pool
by folate pathway is known in the metabolism of limited nitrogen
sources; in particular, relating to the expression of YDR019C
(GCVl; Hong et al., 1999; Piper et al., 2002). Furthermore, the
identiﬁcation of glycine, serine and threonine pathway agrees with
(Sinclair and Dawes, 1995) who show that glycine and serine levels
increase when yeast has limited nitrogen resources and suggest that
these compounds are used as a substitute source of nitrogen.

Extrapolation of the M7 component from the beginning
compound of the path, 4-aminobenzoate, reveals M7 to be a subset
of the larger folate biosythesis pathway. The larger pathway begins
with the compound GTP in purine metabolism and ﬂows into the
one carbon pool by folate pathway through C00415 dihydrofolate
(DHF). This extrapolation agrees with research indicating that
nitrogen starvation is characterized by an increase in nucleotide
levels as metabolized by purine metabolism (Boer et al., 2010).
These nucleotides could then act as a potential nitrogen source
required for the synthesis of glycine and serine. However, this
required extrapolation is indicative of a potential limitation of the
pathway mining approach and its bias towards short path length.
The bias of pathway ranking methods towards shorter path lengths
results in the identiﬁcation of only a minimal subset of the full
metabolic response. To gain a complete understanding of the full
metabolic response requires either extrapolation about the identiﬁed
paths or the further reﬁnement of the hypothesis through explicit
speciﬁcation of start and end compounds.

3.1.4 (M8, M9): H202 and menadione The H202 (M9) and
menadione (M8) stress have a similar core structure centering around

the one carbon pool by folate pathway. The deﬁning feature of
menadione exposure (M8) is the cycle from C00014 (ammonia),
C00037 (glycine), C01242 (S-aminomethyldihydrolipoylprotein),
C00143 (5,10-methylene-THF), C00445 (5,10-methenyl-THF),
C00101 (THF) and back to ammonia primarily by the interaction
between the genes YDR019C (GCVl) and YMR189W (GCV2).
The conversion of ammonia to 5,10-methylene-THF is absent in
the H202 component (M9), instead the pathway ﬁnishes at 5.10-
methenyl-THF or 10-formyl-THF. GCVl and GCV2 are known to
be expressed during menadione exposure (Zhang et al., 2003) and
this effect is used to separate the H202 and menadione responses.

3.1.5 (M10): stationary phase The stationary phase is found to
possess a unique response deﬁned by the transition from C00236
(3-phospho-D—glyceroyl phosphate) into C00065 (serine) through
glycolysis. The identiﬁcation of coordinated expression of glycolysis
genes agrees with previous research, which indicates that over-
expression of the central metabolic pathways is a hallmark of
stationary phase metabolism in yeast (Gasch et al., 2000; Martinez
et al., 2004).

3.1.6 (M11, M12, M13): common oxidative stress response
Clusters M11, M12 and M13 relate to common oxidative stress
response, which is induced by multiple stress conditions . The
grouping of the stress conditions, reverse heat shock, menadione,
H202 and diamide agree with oxidative stress response being a
common component of multiple stress responses (Gasch et al.,
2000). Additionally, the identiﬁcation of the pentose phosphate
pathway is expected as it is known to be activated in yeast during
oxidative stress (Slekar et al., 1996). Furthermore, the synthesis of
C00199 (D-ribulose 5-phosphate) or C00117 (ribose 5-phosphate)
within the pentose phosphate pathway in M12 has been shown to be
a key marker of oxidative stress in Arabidopsis (Baxter et al., 2007).

3.2 Metabolic proﬁling of insulin resistance

The minimum path analysis for HME3M classifying insulin
resistance is presented in Figure 4. From Figure 4, we observe a
direct impact between path length and HME3M performance. At
small minimum path lengths, the performance is relatively poor and
the predictive variance is large. Increasing the minimum path length
not only increases accuracy, but also stability of the HME3M model.
Optimum performance is reached with a minimum path setting of
four genes. This relatively small minimum path setting indicates that

insulin resistance is the result of metabolism of only a few critical
compounds. We now set the minimum path setting to four and extract
the key pathway components for insulin resistance.

The key component for insulin resistance identiﬁed by HME3M
is presented in Figure 5. The complete structure of both the
insulin resistant and insulin sensitive components is displayed in
Figures 2 and 3 of the Supplementary Material. Figure 5 presents
the same component in terms of its connected pathways (Fig. 5a)
and compounds (Fig. 5b). The line thickness represents highly
probable pathways. The connected reaction and gene networks
can be found in the Supplementary Material. It is clear from
Figure 5a that purine metabolism is the primary driver of insulin
resistance. The highly probable edges within compound network
(Fig. 5b) relate to conversions between C00002 (ATP) through
C00046 (RNA) C00075 (UTP), C00063 (CTP), C00044 (GTP) and
C01261 (GppppG). These steps are performed by a common set of
reactions and genes (Supplementary Fig. 2). Although this common
set of compounds is a major feature of the pathway structure it is
not strongly related to insulin resistance but rather serves as the
exit point used by all pathways through purine metabolism. The
features that relate strongly to insulin resistance are compounds
used to create ATP, a key signaling molecule in diabetes and insulin
secretion (Koster et al., 2005).

In Figure 5b, ATP is observed to be synthesized from C01260
(AppppA), C06197 (ApppA), C06198 (UppppU) or converted to
C00575 (CAMP), C00020 (AMP) and C00008 (ADP) and then back
to ATP. Both AppppA and ApppA are known to have a role in insulin
release (Verspohl and Johannwille, 1998) and have more recently
been linked to diabetes (Riising and Verspohl, 2004; Verspohl et al.,
2003). Additionally, cyclic AMP (cAMP) has recently been indicated
in the production of GLP-1 that is a known factor in insulin secretion
and Type II diabetes (Yu and J in, 2010). GLP-1 is also target for the
drug Byetta that is now being developed to treat Type II diabetes
(Yu and Jin, 2010). Furthermore, the conversion from ADP back
to ATP is an oxidative phosphorylation step using the nucleoside
diphosphate kinase (NDK) enzyme (Lipskaya and Voinova, 2005).
NDK has been previously linked to Type II diabetes (Zhu et al.,
1999) and abnormal oxidative phosphorylation is a known factor in
Type II diabetes (Hojlund et al., 2009).

4 CONCLUSONS

In this article, we have described a complete process for extracting
and analyzing ﬁinctional pathways within global metabolic networks

and gene expression data. The main feature of our approach is that it
allows for analysis at the sub-network, compound, reaction and gene
resolutions, which allows for a complete picture of the metabolic
response. We have shown in this article that our combined approach
extracts biologically meaningful results by identifying key genetic
regulators of environmental stress in yeast and known drug targets
for metabolic networks in humans. Furthermore, our approach is
ﬂexible allowing complete control over the structure and diversity
of the pathways to be found and caters for both unsupervised and
supervised styles of analysis. We believe these results highlight our
approach to be a powerﬁil framework for the analysis of global
metabolic networks.

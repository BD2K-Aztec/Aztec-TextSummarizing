ABSTRACT

Motivation: Infectious disease research is generating an increasing
amount of disparate data on pathogenic systems. There is a growing
need for resources that effectively integrate, analyze, deliver and
visualize these data, both to improve our understanding of infectious
diseases and to facilitate the development of strategies for disease
control and prevention.

Results: We have developed Disease View, an online host—pathogen
resource that enables infectious disease-centric access, analysis
and visualization of host—pathogen interactions. In this resource,
we associate infectious diseases with corresponding pathogens,
provide information on pathogens, pathogen virulence genes and
the genetic and chemical evidences for the human genes that
are associated with the diseases. We also deliver the relationships
between pathogens, genes and diseases in an interactive graph and
provide the geolocation reports of associated diseases around the
globe in real time. Unlike many other resources, we have applied
an iterative, user-centered design process to the entire resource
development, including data acquisition, analysis and visualization.

1 INTRODUCTION

Infectious diseases are complex systems, involving multiple
organisms (e.g. pathogens and hosts) interacting across different
environments and time scales. Much of the data that we have related
to infectious disease is multidimensional, incomplete and likely to
be biased in ways we do not fully understand. In addition, these
data are often not integrated nor interoperable making it difﬁcult
for researchers from different disciplines to communicate and relate
their work to others. Integrating these data remains a formidable
Challenge, and although a handful of individual parts of the system

have been modeled with some success, a global model of infectious
disease does not yet exist. The lack of such a framework makes
it difﬁcult to design effective analytical algorithms to assist in the
development of diagnostics and therapeutics.

Bioinformatic resources have been developed for specialized
areas in infectious disease research; however, they do not
fully interoperate. For example, numerous online resources
exist to support host organism researchers [e.g. Immport
(www.immport.org) and InnateDB (www.innatedb.ca)], offering
rich datasets related to host immune response to microbial
infection; however, they do not yet provide structured access
to associated pathogen data. Similarly, there are many databases
containing comprehensive information about pathogens [e.g.
PATRIC (www.patricbrc.org), ViPR (www.viprbrc.org), IRD
(www.ﬂudb.org), EuPathDB (www.eupathdb.org) and VectorBase
(www.vectorbase.0rg)l, but these do not yet provide structured
access to mammalian host data (e.g. host genes). Still more
online resources offer data related to infectious disease outbreaks
[e.g. CDC (www.cdc.gov), WHO (www.who.int) and HealthMap
(healthmap.org)], yet they mainly focus on epidemiological
information and provide little or no host or pathogen data. Some
resources, such as BiologicalNetworks, PHIDIAS, PHI-base and
FIG, integrate host—pathogen interactions at different levels, but lack
disease or outbreak information (Driscoll et al., 2009; Kozhenkov
et al., 2011; Winnenburg et al., 2008; Xiang et al., 2007). These
are a few recent examples of attempts to integrate different types of
host, pathogen and disease information; a comprehensive review is
beyond the scope of this article. As the infectious disease community
turns its attention to an integrative view of disease, infection and
health, it becomes critical to have access to integrated host, pathogen
and disease data. As such, an integrated information system that
brings together the many facets of infectious disease is urgently
needed.

Also needed are methods for designing and developing user
interfaces to communicate complex integrated infectious disease
data to diverse users, and provide powerﬁil and meaningful ways
to interact with these data. The growing depth and breadth of the
data requires a thoughtful approach to integrating and presenting it
in a useful manner, one that takes into account combinations of data,
interfaces and services from multiple resources, and provides value
added over the sum of its parts. To guide the process of understanding
which data sources to use, how to integrate data and how to portray
data to users, we employ a well-established approach to developing

user interfaces (UIs). Speciﬁcally, we apply usability engineering: a
cost-effective, user-centered iterative process that ensures a high
level of effectiveness and efﬁciency in complex interactive user
interfaces (Gabbard et al., 2003; Hix and Hartson, 1993).

Our ultimate goal is to use informatics frameworks to help
reduce barriers in infectious disease research and development by
providing a broader spectrum of infectious disease, pathogen, host
and outbreak data to enable infectious disease-centric access and
analysis of host—pathogen interactions. Toward this end, we have
developed Disease View, a host—pathogen data and visualization
resource that integrates diverse data sources, including host,
pathogen, host—pathogen interactions and disease outbreak, and
provides a mechanism for infectious disease-centric data analysis
and visualization. We instantiate Disease View as a component of
PATRIC: a National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute
of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) bioinformatics resource
center containing a wealth of resources related to bacterial pathogens
(Snyder et al., 2007).

2 USABILITY ENGINEERING PROCESSES FOR
PATRIC’S DISEASE VIEW

When applying usability engineering (UE) techniques, it is often the
case that the speciﬁc UE methods must be tailored to meet speciﬁc
development goals. For Disease View, we used a combination of
domain analysis, structured interviews, iterative conceptual design
and various usability evaluation methods as described below.
Figure 1 depicts our UE approach, where we iteratively gather
data, interview users and design interfaces. Within each activity,
Figure 1 also shows a number of relevant components, such as users,
databases, interfaces, and so on. Sections 2 through 4 describe in
detail the role of these components. For illustrative purposes, we
also provide a graphical summary of the evolution of PATRIC’s
Disease View user interfaces, from whiteboard sketches to reﬁned
working prototypes, in Supplementary Figure S1.

We began by reviewing and gathering data from existing online
resources containing host, pathogen and infectious disease data, with
a speciﬁc eye toward methods by which researchers and/or resources
have connected these traditionally disparate information realms.
We identiﬁed speciﬁc databases (such as VFDB, CTD, GAD—see
Section 3) as candidate sources to leverage in response to speciﬁc
queries/summaries of interest to infectious disease researchers. We
then explored how these data sources could be logically (and
technically) integrated to provide value-added above and beyond
each singleton data resource. From this work, we generated a
‘strawman’ data model and tabular display to demonstrate the
technical feasibility of a meaningful set of integrated data; where
‘meaningful’ is measured by representative users (as opposed to
developers).

We then conducted structured interviews with researchers
currently working with diseases related to bacterial pathogens. From
these interviews, we identiﬁed high-level ﬁndings such as what
type of researchers will beneﬁt from Disease View, what are the
goals of researchers when using these data, and thus what types of
tasks should we aim to support via Disease View. We also identiﬁed
important speciﬁc ﬁndings such as the types of online information
resources typically used, how these information are used, what
tools are employed to use the data and speciﬁcally how users take
information related to hosts, disease and pathogens and manually
integrate it to address their research questions. For these interviews,
we used the initial strawman to illustrate concepts, verify which data
pieces were most relevant and which were of less (or no) value. From
these insights, we generated user-centered requirements, a speciﬁc
set of most relevant host—pathogen data, and a speciﬁc set of useful
tasks we could support using these data; all of which we used to
inform an initial set of conceptual user interface design sketches.
Through iterative sketching and internal expert usability evaluations
(Section 1 in Supplementary Material), three distinct components
began to evolve: a table representing which diseases are related to
the pathogen(s) of interest, a visual representation of both host and
pathogen genes related to disease and a map depicting location-
based disease information (e.g. recent or historical outbreaks, etc.).
We then created low-ﬁdelity ‘static’ prototypes of Disease View UIs
(manifested as PowerPoint drawings)—allowing us to conduct early
expert usability evaluations without having yet done any software
development; a cost-effective approach that allows us to make
important conceptual Changes with very little cost. At this stage
of development, the expert evaluation was less focused on speciﬁc
detailed UI elements, but instead on page layout, information layout
and interaction with different disease view elements.

Based on expert evaluation, we evolved the wireframes into
reﬁned web-based prototypes that incorporated both static and
interactive components. This approach allowed us to identify
obvious usability problems and improve the UIs prior to conducting
user-based evaluation (Section 1 in Supplementary Material).
As a result, our user-based evaluations yield more valuable,
domain-speciﬁc usability ﬁndings such as to what degree UI
designs cognitively support completion of important tasks. We
conducted several user-based usability evaluations using these
prototypes with representative users from PATRIC’s scientiﬁc
working group. These users included researchers working with
bacterial pathogen-related diseases such as brucellosis, tuberculosis
and helicobacter infection. We worked with several different user
Classes including principal investigators, post-doctoral assistants,

graduate students and lab technicians. During these evaluations,
we observed that users had a difﬁcult time digesting the volume
of information displayed, and attempted to make (unintended)
connections between disparate blocks of information; for example,
trying to associate a table depicting MeSH (Medical Subject
Headings) terms and disease with a map depicting outbreak
information. Moreover, users wanted to allocate more screen
real estate for each of the three main components since each
conveyed a large amount of important information. As such, we
made a design decision to break the three components into three
separate screen/areas: Summary, Disease-Pathogen Visualization
and Disease Map as shown at http://www.patricbrc.org/portal/portal
/patriC/DiseaseOverview?CType=taxon&cId=590.

3 DATA INTEGRATION

A primary Challenge facing bioinformatics researchers is to combine
data from different biological repositories into a single, uniﬁed view
on the data (data integration). Through our usability engineering
process, we incorporated into Disease View six primary data types
of interest to infectious disease researchers: pathogens, virulence
genes, host disease genes, disease outbreaks, related literature and
relationships among infectious disease terms. The relationships
among these modules and their data sources in Disease View are
illustrated in Figure 2.

To integrate the infectious disease, host and pathogen data
obtained from various sources, we developed DiseaseDB,
a relational database implemented in Oracle 11g. See the
Supplementary Figure S2 for the database schema model. The
schema includes data structures for several types of disease data
including: disease—pathogen mappings, pathogens, virulence genes
and human genes associated with infectious diseases. Disease
outbreaks and literature information are dynamically fetched on the
ﬂy from HealthMap and PubMed, respectively, but not stored in the
DiseaseDB. Data types and sources are described below.

3.1 Bacterial infectious disease—pathogen mapping

To incorporate and integrate infectious disease, pathogen virulence
and host data, our ﬁrst step was to map infectious diseases
with corresponding pathogens in a computer recognizable format.

Table 1. Bacterial infectious diseases and pathogen mapping

 

Pathogen taxon level Number of infectious disease terms

 

Species or subspecies 121
Genus 54
Family 18
Order 4
Superkingdom 28

 

We used MeSH (www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh) infectious disease terms
as controlled vocabulary for infectious disease names and
NCBI taxonomy names for the pathogen names. MeSH is a
controlled vocabulary thesaurus used for biomedical and health-
related document indexing. MeSH disease terms are subset of
MeSH terms that have been widely used in disease studies.
Many databases such as Genetic Association Database (GAD,
geneticassociationdb.nih.gov) and Comparative Toxicogenomics
Database (CTD, Ctd.mdibl.org) use MeSH disease terms to extract
and map disease information in biomedical literature (Davis et al.,
2011; Lin et al., 2006). The latest 2011 MeSH version contains
225 distinct bacterial infectious disease terms. The hierarchal MeSH
structure allows more general disease terms to be distinguished from
subclasses. Based on MeSH disease term deﬁnitions and online
medical reference, these bacterial infectious disease terms were
manually curated and mapped to bacterial pathogens with taxonomy
level assigned depending on how speciﬁc or general a disease term
is in the MeSH hierarchy (Table 1; Supplementary Table S1 for
MeSH bacterial infectious disease terms). This mapping enables
association between pathogen-related information such as genomics,
postgenomics, virulence and their corresponding infectious disease
terms.

3.2 Pathogens and pathogen virulence genes

Pathogens, pathogen genomes and pathogen genes were retrieved
directly from PATRIC. The internal ids in PATRIC were mapped and
referenced in DiseaseDB. We incorporated the pathogen virulence
gene information to facilitate understanding the mechanisms of
infection and pathogenesis. Pathogen virulence genes were collected
from two sources: curated virulence genes from Virulent Factor
Database (VFDB, www.mgc.ac.cn/VFs) and the homologs of VFDB
curated virulence genes from blast search within the same genera
to which the curated virulence genes belong (Altschul et al., 1990;
Yang et (11., 2008). The blast cutoff was 95% for identity and 80% for
length coverage. The curated virulence genes and virulence factor
descriptions were downloaded as a ﬂat ﬁle from the VFDB website
and then parsed and stored in DiseaseDB. As of March 2011, we
have integrated 2295 curated virulence genes from VFDB and 36490
taxon-scoped homologs in DiseaseDB. The homolog information
is important for identifying unknown virulence genes in related
genomes, since some homologs are annotated as ‘hypothetical
protein’ in the original genome annotations.

3.3 Human genes associated with infectious diseases

GAD and CTD are two online resources that provide information
about host gene—disease association studies. GAD associates
human genes with diseases using genetic evidence derived from

literature curation. CTD provides manually curated data from
published literature describing cross-species Chemical— and gene—
disease relationships to illuminate molecular mechanisms by which
environmental Chemicals affect human disease. Both resources
incorporate MeSH disease terms in their gene—disease mapping.
The latest data from GAD and CTD were downloaded as ﬂat ﬁles
and then parsed and stored in DiseaseDB for data integration. We
extracted a subset of the human genes (281 genes from GAD and
2286 genes from CTD) that are associated with bacterial infectious
diseases from these sources. We also integrated these sources
together to compare and contrast gene—disease associations that
are identiﬁed genetically and Chemically. Human genome and gene
data were downloaded from HUGO (Human Genome Organization)
Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC, www.genenames.org) and
also stored in DiseaseDB.

3.4 Reports of global infectious disease outbreaks

Global infectious disease outbreak reports were dynamically
retrieved from HealthMap (Freifeld et (11., 2008). HealthMap is
an automated electronic information system that brings together
disparate data sources to provide a uniﬁed view of the current
global impact of infectious diseases. Sources used in HealthMap
include news aggregators, scientiﬁc reports such as ProMED-mail,
World Health Organization, Eurosurveillance, Wildlife Disease
Information Node, individual accounts from users and others. The
infectious diseases associated with NIAID’s 22 watchlist bacterial
pathogens were manually mapped to the disease names deﬁned in
HealthMap (Supplementary Table S2).

The infectious disease, pathogen and host datasets within the
DiseaseDB allow for multiple points of access. For example, a
database query may start with particular diseases and retrieve
virulence factors in linked pathogens or a query may retrieve
human genes involved in human—pathogen interactions from a set
of pathogenic organisms. From a user’s perspective, querying data
is only the ﬁrst step. Data must be presented in a way to support
a researcher’s broader goals of understanding the interaction of
components of disease phenomenon. Disease View relies heavily
on visualization to meet this requirement.

4 VISUALIZING INFECTIOUS DISEASE
RELATIONSHIPS

A primary goal of Disease View is to enable researchers to quickly
identify potentially interesting relationships within infectious
disease data. A powerful method for visualizing entity relationships
is the graph, where nodes represent discrete entities and edges join
nodes that are related in some way. Protein interaction networks
are commonly represented as graphs, for example, with nodes
representing individual proteins and edges joining pairs of proteins
that interact. Graphs can be powerful analytical tools, either through
topological analysis using standard graph theoretical algorithms like
centrality and connectivity (Goh et (11 ., 2007; Jeong et (11 ., 2001) or by
using our own visual pattern recognition system to extract meaning,
derive new hypotheses, identify structure in the data or improve our
conﬁdence in the results of quantitative analyses.

Disease View represents infectious disease relationships as a
multipartite graph (or multigraph) called the Disease-Pathogen
Visualization (see Section 3 in Supplemental Material for ﬁill

details of the graph construction). In brief, the Disease-Pathogen
Visualization uses nodes to represent diseases, pathogens, virulence
genes and disease-associated host genes. Node identity is double
encoded as shape and color in order to Clarify the multiple types in
the graph. Relationships between nodes are represented as edges:
directed edges indicate hierarchical relationships among diseases
(based on MeSH) and among pathogens (based on NCBI taxonomy);
undirected edges indicate associative relationships between diseases
and human genes, and between pathogens and virulence genes.

We Chose to represent integrated infectious disease data as a
multigraph for several reasons: (i) it allows us to integrate multiple
data sources within a single lossless visualization; (ii) it allows us to
combine a high-level perspective on a set of complex relationships
with the ability to drill down to more detailed information; (iii) it
allows us to take advantage of human perceptive cognition to suggest
avenues for further exploration and discovery; and (iv) it became
Clear as a result of our iterative design process that extracting simple
graphs from Disease View data was not as useﬁil as presenting
the entire multigraph, despite the loss of applicability of standard
topological analyses in the latter.

The underlying structure of Disease View data consists of two
interacting hierarchies (pathogen taxonomy and MeSH disease
hierarchy), each ‘decorated’ with a non-overlapping set of genes.
It became Clear during our iterative design process that the most
useful knowledge was found in the relationships between the
two hierarchies, and in the non-hierarchical relationships between
members of a hierarchy (i.e. via shared genes). To emphasize
these features, we developed a novel graph layout algorithm called
mirrored tree. The mirrored-tree algorithm partitions the graph into
three distinct subsets: the rooted disease hierarchy (based on MeSH);
the rooted taxonomy hierarchy (based on NCBI); and the genes
(disease-associated host genes and pathogen-associated virulence
genes). The two hierarchical partitions are laid out as trees, with their
roots at opposite ends of the visible space and their leaves aligned
along the center. Genes (or aggregations of genes) that are unique to
a pathogen or disease are arranged proximal to the associated disease
or pathogen node. Genes that are shared among multiple diseases
or pathogens are placed at the weighted mean distance from all
associated diseases or pathogens. Consistent coloring of nodes and
edges within each of the disease and pathogen hierarchies is used
to emphasize these substructures (see Fig. 4A for an example of the
mirrored-tree algorithm applied to the order Bacillales).

By applying different layout schemes to different partitions of
the Disease-Pathogen Visualization, we use our knowledge of the
underlying graph structure to add Clarity to the representation.
By visually segregating the disease and pathogen hierarchies,
the mirrored-tree layout draws special attention to the high-
value disease—pathogen edges: they are the only edges that cross
the center of the visible space. Furthermore, disease—pathogen
edges that join leaf nodes in the two hierarchies indicate highly
speciﬁc associations, whereas disease—pathogen edges that travel
into the interior of the hierarchies indicate a more general (i.e. less
informative) assignment. The mirrored-tree layout also emphasizes
informative non-hierarchical relationships in the Disease-Pathogen
Visualization. Positioning a disease or pathogen node in Close
proximity to its set of uniquely associated genes forms easily
identiﬁable Clusters of related nodes. The size of each Cluster
suggests how much is known at the genetic level about the given
disease or pathogen. This rudimentary Clustering also facilitates the

Infectious disease data visualization

 

identiﬁcation of genes that may be involved in shared host-response
or infection events: these genes are not part of any Clusters.

In addition to layout, the Disease-Pathogen Visualization also uses
aggregation to reduce visual Clutter without losing information. First,
if a disease or a pathogen has >10 unique associated genes, the
genes are aggregated into a single Collection node, and individual
genes in the Collection are accessible by Clicking the node. Second,
many diseases are associated with taxonomic levels of genus or
higher, reﬂecting non-speciﬁcity in the data. For these cases, the
Disease-Pathogen Visualization includes an edge from each disease
to a pathogen species Collection node.

5 DISEASE VIEW IN PATRIC

We decided early on to implement Disease View as a web-based
component of PATRIC. Currently, PATRIC provides rich data and
analysis tools for all bacterial species including NIAID category
A—C priority bacterial pathogens. It also includes comprehensive
bacterial data such as genome annotation, comparative genomics,
phylogeny, metabolic pathways, transcriptomics, proteomics,
protein structures, protein—protein interactions and published
literature. By leveraging these existing PATRIC resources, we
improved the utility of Disease View as an integrative, web-
based view onto infectious disease. Through our user-centered,
iterative usability engineering process (Section 2), we produced
a set of Disease Views accessible via PATRIC’s taxon landing
pages—dedicated pages for each NCBI taxonomic level, from the
bacteria superkingdom to individual genus pages. These detailed
designs were then polished to employ PATRIC interaction metaphors
and visual style sheets. PATRIC’s web developers implemented
these designs and incorporated the Disease View into PATRIC’s
website.

From the PATRIC home page (http://www.patricbrc.org), a user
can Choose a PATRIC taxon of interest using the Organisms menu
or via the tag Cloud of ‘Most Viewed Bacteria’. This will open
the taxon landing page for that taxon. Clicking the Diseases tab
on the taxon landing page will open the Disease View, which is in
three subsections: the Disease View Summary, the Disease-Pathogen
Visualization and the Disease Map. Note that each Disease View
in PATRIC presents infectious disease data for the given taxon as
well as all Child taxa (i.e. data from lower taxa are rolled up and
represented at the parent level).

The Disease View Summary provides an overview of disease,
pathogen and gene information. It features an Infectious Disease
Overview, containing pathogens and their associated MeSH disease
terms, links to tables of known virulence factors and links to tables
of associated human genes. From this Overview, users may access:
National Library of Medicine MeSH Descriptor data by Clicking
on any MeSH disease term; the taxon landing page for a speciﬁc
PATRIC organism by Clicking on its name; a Virulence Disease table
by Clicking on a number in the Pathogen Virulence Genes column;
tables of human genes associated with each disease, including
genetic and Chemical evidence for the associations, by Clicking on
a number within one of the Human Disease Genes columns. The
Disease View Summary also includes a hyperlinked list of PubMed
literature speciﬁcally related to the associated diseases for the given
pathogens.

The Disease-Pathogen Visualization contains an interactive graph
of the relationships between pathogens, diseases, virulence genes

and disease-associated host genes. Users may Click on nodes and
edges in the graph to view more speciﬁc information, including
links to external resources. Controls along the top of the image allow
users to ﬁlter the graph, adjust the view and the layout, export the
graph as either an image or a Cytoscape-compatible graph ﬁle and
access PATRIC FAQs. Controls along the bottom of the graph afford
interactive panning and zooming.

The Disease Map provides a real-time view of recent reports
of global disease outbreaks, geolocated on an interactive global
map. It also includes the number of recent alerts, time periods,
related diseases, locations, data sources and report categories,
including New & Ongoing Outbreaks, Warnings and International
Signiﬁcance. This feature is made available through a collaboration
between PATRIC and HealthMap.

To view each of these components for Staphylococcus,
for example, visit http://www.patricbrc.org/portal/portal/patric
/DiseaseOverview?CType=taxon&cId=1279.

6 USE CASES OF PATRIC DISEASE VIEW

6.1 Use Case 1: multiple perspectives on an infectious
disease

Disease View positions PATRIC as a single point of contact
for a multifaceted exploration of infectious diseases because it
integrates multiple types of data related to an infectious disease.
One illustrative example is Vibrio cholerae, the water-borne bacterial
pathogen that causes Cholera. Given the recent outbreak of Cholera in
the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, we may be interested
in learning more about this disease. Figure 3 shows a few of the
steps in a possible exploration of this disease. From the PATRIC
home page, we can Click to the landing page for Vibrio, and then
the Disease View (the Diseases tab). Switching to the Disease Map
brings up a map of outbreak reports related to Vibrio-associated
diseases (Fig. 3, map). A preponderance of dark red markers (high
activity) around Haiti and the Dominican Republic reﬂects the still-
active outbreak of Cholera in this region; Clicking any of these
markers will reveal a continuously updated list of related news
reports (not shown in the ﬁgure). Switching to the Summary, we
might see that the Recent PubMed Articles (Fig. 3, upper right)
contains a link to the publication (Chin et (11., 2011) that determined
the origin of the Haiti strain (since this feature of PATRIC Disease
View is continuously updated, the article may no longer be visible
but still accessible by Clicking the ‘more articles’ link). According
to Chin et (11, genetic evidence from various key locations in the
genome indicate that the Haiti isolate is most Closely related to
V.ch01er(1e CIRS 101 (El Tor biotype of 01 serogroup), from an
outbreak in Bangladesh in 2002 and 2008.

The V.ch01er(1e Ol serogroup includes two well-known biotypes:
El Tor and Classical. These biotypes are distinguished on the
basis of biochemical, phenotypic and genetic differences. For
example, Cholera caused by Classical strains is considered more
severe, whereas the El Tor biotype is better able to survive in the
environment. Also, the two biotypes have different alleles for the
cth gene (Safa et (11., 2008), which together with ctxA produces
the Cholera toxin that is responsible for the disease symptoms. In
addition, Classical strains of V.ch01er(1e 01 do not contain the nxC
gene of the repeat in toxin (RTX) Cluster that is responsible for
activating cytotoxicity (Lin et (11., 1999).

data View.

Unlike previous global Cholera pandemics, which were dominated
by more severe, Classical strains, the current pandemic has been
Characterized almost entirely by El Tor strains. Recent evidence,
however, indicates the rise of hybrid strains around the world that
carry the Classical Cholera toxin gene in an El Tor background (Safa
et (11., 2008). This shift in the dominant Cholera toxin has alarming
implications. Since it is the primary contributor to the disease, we
may see more severe symptoms associated with the Classical toxin;
compounding this problem, a genetic shift in the cth gene may
render existing vaccines less effective, and lead to an increase in
antibiotic resistance.

Which type of toxin can we expect from the Haiti isolate? PATRIC
Disease View allows us to explore this question at the genetic
level. We can see in the Summary table that 92 virulence genes
are associated with V.ch01er(1e strains. Clicking that number will
bring up a table of all the virulence gene homologs within PATRIC
(Fig. 3, table). From this table, we can select the cth homologs
from sequenced Vibrio species (13 total at the time of writing),
and generate a multiple sequence alignment (Fig. 3, alignment).

The alignment results Clearly show amino acid substitution events
at positions 39 and 68 of the Cth protein. In contrast to the three
strains (V.ch01er(1e 01 bioviar El Tor str. N16961, V.ch01er(1e RC9
and V.ch01er(1e INDRE 911) harboring the El Tor Cholera toxin
gene, all other strains in the list, including V.ch01er(1e CIRS 101,
carry Y39H and I68T mutations. These mutations are one way to
distinguish the more severe Classical toxins from the El Tor toxins
(Popovic et (11., 1994). Since the Haiti isolate is most Closely related
to V.ch01er(1e CIRS 101, which carries the Classical toxin, we may
hypothesize that the Haiti isolate also produces the Classical toxin.
Chin et (11. conﬁrmed that the two sequenced Haiti isolates contain
the Y39H and I68T mutations, which supports this hypothesis.

6.2 Use Case 2: identifying host genes common to
multiple diseases
PATRIC Disease View facilitates the identiﬁcation of subtle

relationships in the data by aggregating host—pathogen infectious
disease data at different taxonomic levels. For example, the

Fig. 4. Disease-Pathogen Visualizations for order Bacillales (A) and partial Views for class Bacili (B and C); components of PATRIC Disease View for Use
Case 2. Disease nodes are represented as blue rectangles, pathogen nodes as purple triangles and genes as green (host) and red (pathogen) circles.

taxonomic class Bacilli includes several well-known gram-positive
pathogens, including Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Bacillus
anthracis and Listeria. Using the Disease View Summary on the
Bacilli landing page, we can see the diseases associated with all of
these pathogens, including Anthrax, Meningitis, Pneumonia, Scarlet
Fever and more. What are the connections between these diseases?
More speciﬁcally, do they share any host genes in common?
Identifying host genes shared by multiple diseases from related
pathogens may suggest potential areas of interest for developing
therapeutics.

The Disease-Pathogen Visualization for Bacilli can reveal inter-
relationships among these pathogens from the perspective of
their associated diseases. The layout of the graph itself reveals
multiple host genes shared among more than one Bacilli-related
disease. For example, by rolling over the node that represents
the CRP (C-Reactive Protein) gene, we can see it is associated

with Staphyloccocal, Streptococcal and Pneumococcal Infections
(Fig. 4B). CRP is a general host-response protein produced by
hepatocytes and normally found at very low levels in blood serum.
During acute phase protein reaction (a non-speciﬁc response to
inﬂammatory stimuli like bacteria and Viruses), the concentration of
CRP rapidly increases several hundredfold, and it undergoes Ca2+-
dependent binding to various compounds including speciﬁc target
molecules from bacteria. Consequently, elevated CRP concentration
is routinely used to diagnose infectious disease in a clinical setting;
it can also be used to differentiate between bacterial and Viral
infections.

From the Disease-Pathogen Visualization of Disease View, we
might tentatively conclude that CRP would be useful in diagnosing
Streptococcal, Staphylococcal and Pneumonococcal infections,
since CRP is associated with these disease classes. Published studies
do support this conclusion (Lindback et al., 1989), although care

must be taken to avoid over-interpretation of the Disease View
relationships. For example, it may be tempting to hypothesize further
that Listeria infection does not lead to elevated CRP levels, since
there is no known disease—gene association in the graph; however,
this is more likely due to a lack of data, since several studies support
just such an association (Kleemann et al., 2009; Saleem et al.,
2008).

In another example from the Bacilli, rolling over the node that
represents the TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor) gene reveals that it is
associated with Staphylococcal infections, Listeriosis (Listeria) and
Anthrax (Bacillus anthracis) (Fig. 4C). TNF is a cytokine involved
in inﬂammation and the regulation of immune cells, and it has
been identiﬁed as an important mediator of septic shock (Beutler
et al., 1985), a serious and often fatal condition that results from
bacterial infection. Because sepsis can also arise from bacterial
infections in general, we would expect the TNF gene to be associated
with more than just Bacilli. By navigating up the taxonomic tree
to the Firmicutes, we can use the Disease-Pathogen Visualization
to verify an additional relationship between TNF and Tetanus
(Clostridium tetani). In addition, despite a more complicated picture,
the Disease-Pathogen Visualization for Proteobacteria reveals that
TNF is implicated in multiple gram-negative diseases as well (ﬁgure
not shown).

7 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

We have developed Disease View, an online host—pathogen resource
that provides easy access to integrated infectious disease, host,
pathogen and disease outbreak data in a user-friendly web interface
via the PATRIC resource. This resource enables the analysis of
large integrated host—pathogen—disease datasets to facilitate our
understanding of the disease mechanisms and to assist in the
development of diagnostics and therapeutics. In comparison with
many other resources mentioned in Section 1, the strengths of our
approach are as follows: (i) Disease View enables infectious disease
centric access of host, pathogen and outbreak information; (ii)
diseases can be viewed at any level of the bacterial taxonomic tree;
(iii) interactive graphs are provided online to enable visual analysis
of the host—pathogen—disease network; in addition, the graphs can
be downloaded as static images or exported to Cytoscape; and (iv)
a well-established usability engineering process has been applied
throughout this work to ensure the high level of effectiveness and
quality of the software.

We present the following lessons learned while developing
Disease View: (i) when dealing with a large amount of heterogeneous
data, care must be taken not to overload user interfaces such that
users either become disoriented or draw erroneous conclusions
between pieces of unrelated data. Do not assume you know what
users want; ask them. And subsequently focus the data and interfaces
to serve these focused communities and/or use cases. (ii) Do not
underestimate the power of visual analysis. Initially, we attempted to
devolve the disease—pathogen—gene multigraph into sets of bipartite
graphs for numerical analyses, but user feedback told us very
clearly that the multigraph was the more useful analytical tool in
this case.

In the future, we will continue to improve Disease View by
providing customized searches and data analysis tools, adding host—
pathogen interactions and additional data from animal models.
Through our user interviews, we also see a need to develop

disease-centric landing pages (e.g. a Tuberculosis page) to include
information about diseases such as symptoms, diagnostics, vaccines,
treatments and host response.

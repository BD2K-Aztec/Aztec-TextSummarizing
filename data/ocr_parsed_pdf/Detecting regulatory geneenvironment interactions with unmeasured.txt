ABSTRACT

Motivation: Genomic studies have revealed a substantial heritable
component of the transcriptional state of the cell. To fully understand
the genetic regulation of gene expression variability, it is important
to study the effect of genotype in the context of external factors
such as alternative environmental conditions. In model systems,
explicit environmental perturbations have been considered for this
purpose, allowing to directly test for environment-specific genetic
effects. However, such experiments are limited to species that can
be profiled in controlled environments, hampering their use in import-
ant systems such as human. Moreover, even in seemingly tightly regu-
lated experimental conditions, subtle environmental perturbations
cannot be ruled out, and hence unknown environmental influences
are frequent. Here, we propose a model-based approach to simultan-
eously infer unmeasured environmental factors from gene expression
profiles and use them in genetic analyses, identifying environment-
specific associations between polymorphic loci and individual gene
expression traits.

Results: In extensive simulation studies, we show that our method is
able to accurately reconstruct environmental factors and their inter-
actions with genotype in a variety of settings. We further illustrate the
use of our model in a real-world dataset in which one environmental
factor has been explicitly experimentally controlled. Our method is
able to accurately reconstruct the true underlying environmental
factor even if it is not given as an input, allowing to detect genuine
genotype—environment interactions. In addition to the known environ-
mental factor, we find unmeasured factors involved in novel genotype—
environment interactions. Our results suggest that interactions with
both known and unknown environmental factors signiﬁcantly contrib-
ute to gene expression variability.

1 INTRODUCTION

Large-scale genotyping and expression proﬁling initiatives have
fostered expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses, inves-
tigating the genetic component of gene expression variability.
eQTL studies in human (Montgomery et al., 2010; Pickrell
et al., 2010; Stranger et al., 2007, 2012), segregating yeast strains
(Brem et al., 2002; Smith and Kruglyak, 2008), mouse (Schadt
et al., 2005) and Arabidopsis thaliana (Gan et al., 2011; West
et al., 2007) have revealed an abundance of associations between
genetic polymoprhisms and the expression levels of individual
genes.

While building this compendium of eQTLs in different genetic
systems and species, it has become clear that the cellular
and environmental context needs to be taken into account to
fully understand the genetic architecture of gene expression
(McCarthy et al., 2008). One route toward investigating such
context dependency is explicit experimental stratification. In
human, expression profiling in different tissue types, both in un-
related individuals (Fu et al., 2012; Nica et al., 2011) and families
(Grundberg et al., 2012), has shown that eQTLs frequently have
tissue-speciﬁc effect sizes, and in some cases exhibit opposite ef-
fects. Analogously, also different environmental backgrounds
and cellular contexts may modulate the genetic control of mo-
lecular traits (Smith and Kruglyak, 2008; Vinuela et al., 2010),
suggesting that environment-speciﬁc genetic effects, also called
genotypewnvironment interactions, are the rule rather than the
exception.

Despite their relevance, molecular studies with explicit envir-
onmental perturbations are difﬁcult to carry out in population-
scale studies. Precise control of the environmental state can-
not be achieved for many important organisms. For example
in human, the relevant environment could be of climatological
or social nature, and hence is either completely unknown
(Gibson, 2008) or can only be indirectly inﬂuenced via targeted
sample selection (Nath et al., 2012). Furthermore, the most
relevant factors for molecular regulation may not be a global
external condition but rather cellular factors, which are in
turn driven by genetic or external factors (Litvin et al., 2009).
In all of these settings, the most relevant context and environ-
ment are not directly measurable; hence, statistical inference of
these factors is needed to study their implications on the tran-
scriptional state.

Detecting regulatory gene-environment interactions

 

Recently, several methods have been proposed to account for
unknown confounding in eQTL studies, a substantial proportion
of which can be attributed to subtle environmental effects (Fusi
et al., 2012; Leek and Storey, 2007; Listgarten et al., 2010; Stegle
et al., 2010). While these methods have been shown to substan-
tially increase power in detecting true eQTLs, the potential of
using such recovered factors to identify genotypewnvironment
interactions has largely been overlooked.

Here, we present an integrated probabilistic model, LInear
Mixed Model Interaction (LIMMI), which allows for recovering
unknown environmental or cellular factors from gene expression
proﬁles and detecting genotypeienvironment interactions.
LIMMI allows for a ﬂexible class of environmental and genetic
effects that act on gene expression, including direct effects and
interactions between them (Fig. 1). At the same time, the model
enforces that the estimated factors are truly environmental and
not themselves under genetic control.

We evaluate LIMMI on synthetic data, where we assess the
ability of LIMMI to (i) recover the true simulated environmental
state, (ii) better detect direct genetic effects and, in particular, (iii)
identify genotypewnvironment interactions with unmeasured en-
vironmental factors. We then revisit an eQTL study on yeast
(Smith and Kruglyak, 2008), where we compare the inference
of LIMMI with a measured environmental variable. Beyond ac-
curately recovering this known environmental effect, LIMMI
retrieves an additional 14 factors that are orthogonal to the gen-
etic state. When using these factors to test for environment-spe-
ciﬁc genetic effects, we ﬁnd hotspots of genotypewnvironment
interactions, some of which are enriched for known response
processes to environmental stimuli. Finally, we demonstrate
that including interactions between genotype and learnt factors
in a mixed model improves both detection power as well as cali-
bration of test statistics for direct genetic effects in an eQTL scan.

2 METHODS

LIMMI is based on a linear additive model that explains phenotype
variability as the sum of genetic and non-genetic factors. Formally,
assume we are given an eQTL dataset comprising a gene expression
matrix Y = [y1, . . . , yG] of G gene expression levels. Each expression pro-
ﬁle yg is observed in Nindividuals, i.e. yg = [y(g,1), . . . ,y(g,N)]. We assume
that the expression estimates Y are variance stabilized, i.e. the

Gene expression levels

Fig. 1. Illustration of regulatory effects on gene expression modeled by
LIMMI. First, non-genetic environmental factors can either be measured
(observed) or hidden. Their effect on gene expression is typically domi-
nated by direct effects (blue). In addition, some factors may act in a
genotype-speciﬁc manner, for example, with effects only standing out
in a particular genetic background (red). Finally, there are standard gen-
etic expression QTLs with individual genetic loci regulating gene expres-
sion levels (black)

measurement error is independent of the expression level. Suitable vari-
ance-stabilizing transformations have previously been proposed for both
data from microarray technologies (Lin et al., 2008) and RNA-Seq data
(Anders and Huber, 2010).

Expression variability is modeled as the sum of effects from single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) S and non-genetic (environmental)
factors X. The generative model underlying LIMMI allows for direct
effects on the phenotype, as well as interaction effects between SNPs
and environmental factors. Using the framework of linear mixed
models, the joint contribution to the expression variability of a single
gene g can be written as the sum of individual covariance matrices for
each of these respective effect types

population structure 0015‘:

Here, the individual N x N covariance matrices explain the joint co-
variation across genes due to genetic effects (Ks) and environmental fac-
tors (Kx), while KI explains the joint covariation due to genotype
environment interactions. Additionally, we include a genetic relatedness
matrix Kp as a variance component, to account for confounding due to
population structure, which can be estimated from the genotype data
itself (Kang et al., 2008b, 2010; Lippert et al., 2011).

To determine suitable expressions for the individual covariance matri-
ces, let the matrix of genotypes for the same N individuals be
S = [51, . . . , 5K] ofK SNPs. We use a binary (0,1) encoding for homozy-
gous and a (0,1,2) encoding for heterozygous organisms; however, other
encodings can be considered as well. Furthermore, let X = [X”,Xh]
denote the set of non-genetic factors that inﬂuence the gene expression
levels, where X” e [RNXC are a prioriiobserved (measured) environmental
covariates and X" e [RA/XL denote unobserved factors we would like to
infer from the expression proﬁles.

Let the symbol 0 denote the element-wise product. An interacting pair
of a SNP 5;, and a factor x,, can then be represented by the vector
(5;, 0 x,,). In this form, the factor effect is masked for all samples where
the genetic state is zero, here the major allele. Other interaction models
can be implemented in an analogous manner (Hallgrimsdbttir and
Yuster, 2008).

Assuming only linear additive effects of single SNPs, environmental
factors and their interactions, we write all variance components in the
form of linear kernels:

The set @K = {072, ,82,y2,o;,of} denotes all kernel parameters. The
relevance (variance) of individual direct factor effects, direct SNP effects
and factorisNP interactions is controlled by the relevance parameters
as, ,8: and will, respectively. The covariance model in Equation (2) can
also be derived from a linear model equivalence (see Supplementary
Methods, Section 1), assuming a hierarchical prior on the effect sizes
for interactions and direct effects across all genes.

2.1 Inference

The large number of SNPs in real-world datasets renders learning the
relevance parameters for all K genetic effects ([52) and K x Q interaction
terms (yli q) in Equation (2) infeasible, both computationally and

statistically (see also Section 2.2.4). However, it is safe to assume sparsity
where only a small fraction of all genome-wide SNPs have a non-zero
SNP effect or SNPifactor interaction effect (Smith and Kruglyak, 2008;
Stranger et al., 2007). In the following, we call SNPs with a non-zero
main effect or interaction effect active; the relevance parameters (,8: and
ylf, q) of all remaining SNPs are implicitly assumed to be zero, which is
equivalent to them being dropped from the model. We exploit this as-
sumption to construct an algorithm similar, in principle, to expectation
maximization (EM). Let us denote the set of active direct effect SNPs
(,8: > 0) as S. Analogously, the set of active SNPifactor pairs with non-
zero relevances (y; ,1 > 0) will be denoted I. Inference in the full model is
then achieved by alternating between two operations. First, the factors X
and model parameters @K are learnt for given active sets 8 and I.
Second, for fixed state of X, @K, additional SNPs are added to the
active sets 8 and I using a greedy forward selection strategy. A speciﬁc
schedule of these updates is used to ensure convergence to accurate
solutions.

In Section 2.2, we describe this EM-like iterative training scheme. The
technical building blocks of the individual training steps are presented in
Section 2.2.1, describing the gradient-based optimization of model par-
ameters, and in Section 2.2.2, addressing the selection of SNPs to be
included in the model. More details about the implementation and the
initialization of the model are available in the Supplementary Methods.

2.2 Iterative training of LIMMI

Training is achieved in three steps. First, the state of the environmental
factors X and the model parameters @K is inferred for empty active sets,
where both the set of SNPs with a direct effect (8) and the interactions (I)
have no elements. The necessary parameter inference for given active sets
is achieved using a gradient-based optimization approach (see Section
2.2.1). As previously shown (Fusi et al., 2012), this simplistic inference
that ignores the effect of genotype may result in learnt hidden factors that
are correlated with genotype and hence have a genetic component. To
rule out genetic control of the latent factors, SNPs that are correlated
with these hidden variables are included in the set 8 (see Section 2.2.2),
and the model parameters and factors are retrained. This process is iter-
ated until no additional SNPs reach genome-wide signiﬁcance for asso-
ciation with any of the learnt factors X. As a result of this process,
genotype and the learnt hidden factors are quasi-orthogonal (see also
Fusi et al., 2012 for further details).

Once the environmental factors have been determined, genotypeaen-
vironment interactions are detected and SNPifactor pairs that participate
in a signiﬁcant interaction are included in the set I (Section 2.2.3). The
model parameters are once again updated. This step completes the train-
ing. Individual components of the ﬁnal covariance can then be used to
test for speciﬁc hypotheses; see Section 2.3.

2.2.] Gradient-based inference of covariance parameters If the
SNP effects and interactions are only present for a deﬁned active set of
direct SNP effects (8) and interactions between pairs of SNPs and factors
(I), the full likelihood in Equation (2) reduces to

where 2‘. is the overall covariance, which in turn is parametrized by X, @K
and the active sets 8 and I. Here, we have dropped the mean effect to

unclutter the notation, and the summation is restricted to the elements in
the respective active sets. The log of the marginal likelihood from
Equation (3) can be written as

and combing it with the covariance derivative with respect to the ith

kernel parameter, ﬁll, using the chain rule (Lawrence, 2005).

Parameter learning can then be done using a maximum likelihood
approach, jointly determining the most probable state of the hidden en-
vironmental states X and model parameters @K

A standard gradient-based optimizer, such as L-BFGS-B (Zhu et al.,
1997), can be used to take advantage of the availability of closed-form
gradients with respect to the elements of X and @K. A discussion on how
the latent dimensionality Q is chosen and the implications on the model
ﬁtting are provided in Supplementary Methods, Section 2.

2.2.2 Inclusion of genetic eﬂects Individual SNPs are selected for
inclusion in S. We follow the approach taken in Fusi et al., (2012), and
test for correlation between individual factors x1, . . . , xQ and all genome-
wide SNPs 51, . . . ,sK. In each iteration, SNPs that are in signiﬁcant as-
sociation [assessed using q-values (Storey and Tibshirani, 2003)
qv 5 aSNp] are added to the active set S. The exact cutoff aSNp is not
critical, as it merely alters the number of SNPs in the model, thereby
affecting computational speed. Robustness with respect to this signiﬁ-
cance cutoff has previously been demonstrated (Fusi et al., 2012).

2.2.3 Inclusion of interaction eﬂects After the iterative procedure to
determine the state of the environmental factors has converged, it is pos-
sible to test for interactions between factors and individual SNPs. We do
so by exhaustively testing for interactions between SNPs k e {1, ...,K}
and factors (1 e {1, ..., Q} (Section 2.3.1). Signiﬁcant interaction terms
(qv 5 anE) are then added to the active set I. Finally, LIMMI relearns
all the model parameters while taking into account the newly added
interactions, which allow the model to explain non-linear dependencies
due to genotypeenvironment interactions.

2.2.4 Identiﬁability and robustness Naive inclusion of all possible
effects is both computationally intractable and statistically not identiﬁ-
able, as this would result in K + (Q > K) relevance parameters. Greedy
step-wise strategies, in contrast, suffer from convergence to local optima.
To reduce such side effects, we enforce sparsity in a two-step procedure.
First, a cutoff is used for the inclusion of genetic markers (aSNp 5 0.1 in
the case of the yeast dataset presented in Section 3.2) and interaction
terms (oerE 5 0.05 again in the case of the yeast dataset) into the
model. Then, irrelevant variance parameters ([52, will) are set to zero
during inference by means of automatic relevance determination
(Mackay, 1995). The empirical stability of this approach has been
explored in previous work (Fusi et al., 2012).

Although we have taken measures to ensure that the learnt factors are
likely environmental, there are fundamental limitations on statistical
identiﬁability. The correct identiﬁcation of factors that exhibit

Detecting regulatory gene-environment interactions

 

genotype-speciﬁc interactions affecting large numbers of target genes is
particularly challenging. The variance explained by such an interaction
hotspot can be similar to the variance of a direct factor effect, such that a
single factor may mistakingly be learnt as two separate factors. When
testing for interactions with the main effect factor, the second one can
explain away the interaction signals; hence, the interaction hotspot may
not be detected. Thus, our approach depends on the assumption that the
direct contribution of environmental factors dominates genotype-speciﬁc
effects. This assumption is reasonable in practice, and we found LIMMI
to be robust with respect to deviations from it (see Fig. 2c and d and
Supplementary Fig. S3).

2.2.5 Computational eﬂiciency There are two components of the
LIMMI model that determine the computational complexity. First,
the Gaussian process latent variable model (Section 2.2.1), estimating
the covariance parameters and the environmental factors, has a complex-
ity that is independent of the number of genes. Instead, its runtime is
dominated by inversions of the covariance matrix, which scale cubically
with the number of samples. Thanks to modern linear algebra implemen-
tations, these computations are tractable even for thousands of samples.
Second, given the latent variables, LIMMI carries out mixed model inter-
action and association tests relating inferred factors, genes and SNPs.
Here, we build on recent advances in mixed models (Lippert et al.,
2011), reducing the computational complexity of these statistical tests
to a cost that is linear in the number of samples and tested hypotheses.
Moreover, this second step can easily be parallelized across hypotheses,
which is supported in our software implementation.

As a result, LIMMI can be applied to human-scale datasets with hun-
dreds of samples, ~50 000 gene expression levels and ~100 000 SNPs.

For example, on the yeast dataset analyzed in Section 3.2, LIMMI con-
verged within only 50min [implementation based on a Gaussian
processes framework in python, while association and interaction scans
are implemented in C++. Runtime estimates are given for a GNU/Linux
machine with an Intel® Xeon® X7542 12C CPU and 64 gigabytes of
RAM. The python scientiﬁc libraries (Numpy and Scipy) were compiled
against the Intel® Math Kernel Library]. These datasets contained 218
samples, 2956 SNPs and S493 gene expression levels.

2.3 Statistical association and interaction testing

The ultimate goal is to use the covariance models described above to
carry out tests for genetic associations (eQTLS) as well as tests for geno-
type—environment interactions. Statistical testing is also used to iteratively
expand the LIMMI covariance model (Section 2.1).

For testing, we use a strategy based on linear mixed models, where a
ﬁtted covariance structure 2‘. accounts for confounding and other factors
that cause expression variability, whereas the ﬁxed effect assesses the
relevance of the effect of interest

V hﬁ

fiXCd CffCCt random effect

The overall variance of the trait a; can be efﬁciently determined in
closed form for each test (SNPigene pair), whereas 8g requires a grid-
based optimization. We use the approximation proposed in Kang et al.
(2008b) and Lippert et al. (2011), and determine 8g once on the null
model, and keep this variance ratio ﬁxed for all genome-wide tests.

When testing for associations and interactions with LIMMI, the co-
variance Z‘. is intended to capture the effects from other SNPs, confound-
ing factors and interactions. The covariance is derived from the
components ﬁtted on the null model (Section 2.1). A mechanistic under-
standing of the individual covariance components can be gained when
deriving the individual covariance parameters from a linear model
equivalence (Supplementary Methods, Section 1).

In Section 2.3.1, we describe the covariance used for genotypefactor
interaction tests (genotype—environment interactions). Association tests
between genotype and expression traits (eQTL) are described in Section
2.3.2. Both, for interaction and association scans, we obtain P-values by
applying a likelihood ratio test. For genome-wide signiﬁcance estimates,
we used false discovery rate (FDR) estimates from the q-value package
(Storey and Tibshirani, 2003).

2.3.] Interaction test The likelihood ratio corresponding to the test
for a particular SNP k and factor q affecting gene g can be expressed as

where 6,; g, 6k, g and 6,], g correspond to the ﬁtted ﬁxed effect weight of the
interaction term, the SNP effect and the factor effect, respectively. We
have dropped the mean effect ug to unclutter the notation. The back-
ground covariance includes all other additive effects and is deﬁned as

2,, = (rij + Z aiming, accounting for known covariates and the

direct effects of all factors but factor (1, which is tested.

Equation (8).

2.4 LIMMI-sva

In principle, in the ﬁrst step of the procedure outlined in Section 2.2.1,
any latent variable model could be used to infer environmental factors.
For comparison, we have implemented a variant of LIMMI called
LIMMI-sva. LIMMI-sva uses surrogate variable analysis (SVA) (Leek
and Storey, 2007), which does not encourage orthogonality of learnt
factors and genotype and does not rely on the iterative model reﬁnement
described in Section 2.2. The details of the testing procedure are described
in Supplementary Methods, Section 3.

3 RESULTS

We evaluated the ability of LIMMI to retrieve genuine geno-
typeienvironment interactions. In particular, we studied the rela-
tive performance of two approaches, LIMMI and LIMMI-sva,
that share the same testing procedure but infer the unknown
environment in different ways (Section 2.4). We also considered
a standard linear association test as a baseline method.

3.1 Simulation study

First, we tested LIMMI on simulated data, where the underlying
true associations and genotypewnvironment interactions are
known. The simulation procedure largely follows previous stu-
dies to assess the performance of eQTL methods (Fusi et al.,
2012; Listgarten et al., 2010). Each simulated dataset consisted
of 800 SNPs simulated as from an F2 cross and 1000 gene ex-
pression levels. We simulated ﬁve environmental factors that
have both direct effects on gene expression and interactions
with genotype. In addition, we also considered five simulated
technical factors that affect gene expression directly but are in-
dependent of genotype.

The factor profiles were independently drawn from N(0, l),
and the effect sizes of factors g on genes g was sampled from
w,” ~ N(0, 0.45), which is similar to empirical estimates from
the yeast dataset (Smith and Kruglyak, 2008). We added 800
simulated associations with effect sizes sampled from
wgJC ~ N(0, 0.05) as well as ﬁve interactions between randomly
chosen pairs of genetic loci and environmental factors, each af-
fecting 15% of the genes and with an effect size sampled from
N (0, 0.15). Broad genetic effects, such as trans-acting genetic
variants, can complicate the recovery of the confounding factors
(Fusi et al., 2012). If the genetics and the environment are not
modeled jointly, part of the genetic signal will be captured by the
estimated confounding factors, making the discovery of geno-
typeienvironment interactions even harder. To further investi-
gate this hypothesis, we simulated ﬁve broad trans-acting genetic
variants, each affecting 20% of the genes and with an effect size
sampled from N(0, 0.2). Finally, we added independent meas-
urement noise to each gene Illg ~N(0,0.15). The simulation
framework used here does not favor any of the considered meth-
ods, as they all share the assumption that the environmental state
is characterized by few environmental factors, i.e. is low rank.

First, we checked that factor models like LIMMI are able to
recover environmental variables and genewnvironment regula-
tory interactions. Figure 2a depicts the receiver operating char-
acteristic (ROC) curve, assessing the true positive rate of

alternative methods as a function of the permitted false positive
rate (FPR). For practical applications, the regime of few false
positives is most relevant; hence, we consider the ROC analysis
on the range of FPR between 0 and 0.2. Determining an explicit
mapping between the learnt environmental factors and the simu-
lated ones is difﬁcult and may introduce biases. Thus, we as-
sessed the accuracy of recovering SNPigene pairs with a
detected interaction for any of the learnt environmental factors.
Both LIMMI-sva and LIMMI detected many of the simulated
genotypeaenvironment interactions, where LIMMI signiﬁcantly
outperformed LIMMI-sva.

Next, we evaluated alternative methods for detecting eQTLs,
i.e. direct associations between polymorphic loci and gene ex-
pression levels that are not environment specific (Fig. 2b).
Standard linear regression (LINEAR) ignores the presence of
unknown environmental factors, which resulted in a poor recov-
ery of true associations. SVA and PANAMA account for the
direct effect of learnt environmental factors, resulting in a con-
siderable improvement compared with the linear model (see also
discussion in Fusi et al., 2012; Listgarten et al., 2010; Stegle et al.,
2010). Finally, LIMMI also accounts for both the learnt envir-
onmental factors and their interactions with the genetic state,
resulting in a marginal but consistent improvement over
PANAMA.

Supplementary Figure S2 presents the analogous results when
considering a precisionirecall measure, leading to the same
conclusions.

Finally, we investigated the impact when changing the relative
magnitude of direct environmental effects and genotypeienvir-
onment interactions. Figure 2c and (1 show the respective area
under the ROC curve (AUC) when varying the relative fractions
of variance explained by genotypewnvironment interactions and
direct environmental effects. In each plot, the leftmost point cor-
responds to a setting with very small (0.01) relative proportion of
variance explained by interactions, whereas the rightmost point
corresponds to an equal proportion (0.50) of variance explained
by direct effects and interactions. As expected, the ability of
LIMMI to detect genotypewnvironment interactions improved
with larger relative effect sizes of the interactions (Fig. 2c),
whereas the performance of LIMMI-sva degraded when the rela-
tive variance explained by interactions exceeded 10%. This ob-
servation exempliﬁes the model misﬁt of approaches like SVA
that ignore genotypewnvironment interactions during inference.
Analogous conclusions hold when considering the performance
of the considered methods to detect direct associations or eQTLs
(Fig. 2d). Here, PANAMA came close second and again SVA
degraded in performance for increasing relevance of the inter-
action terms. Remarkably, starting from 30% of the variance
explained by genotypeienvironment interactions, a standard
linear association test that ignores unknown environments en-
tirely yielded more accurate results than SVA.

In addition to varying the relative proportion of interactions
and direct environmental effects, we also considered varying the
variance of each effect type in isolation. Supplementary Figure
S3 shows analogous AUC performances when varying the vari-
ance explained by direct factor effects (Supplementary Fig. S3a
and b) or the variance from genotypeifactor interactions
(Supplementary Fig. S3c and d), keeping the other term con-
stant. In contrast to alternative methods, LIMMI was able to

Detecting regulatory gene-environment interactions

 

detect genotypeienvironment interactions even for weak inter-
action effects (<10%, Supplementary Fig. S3c), suggesting that
the method is suitable in studies where genotypewnvironment
interactions have a subtle effect.

LIMMI is related to previous approaches, such as SVA (Leek
and Storey, 2007) and PANAMA (Fusi et al., 2012), that have
predominantly been intended to identify and account for the
effect of technical factors. To assess the effect of technical factors
versus environmental effects, we considered a series of simulated
settings, changing the relative proportions of environmental and
technical factors. In principle, LIMMI will retrieve both types of
factors on equal footing; however, only environmental inﬂuences
are expected to yield interactions with the genetic state. Indeed,
the results presented in Supplementary Figure S4 support that
even when almost all factors are technical and do not interact
with genotype, LIMMI is still able to recover the small number
of genuine genotypeienvironment interactions.

3.2 Applications in yeast genetics of gene expression

We revisited the yeast study from Smith and Kruglyak (2008),
studying genetic regulation of gene expression as a function of
environmental background. In this study, an F2 population of
yeast strains has been expression profiled in two contrasting
growth media: glucose and ethanol. Thus, the growth medium
is a strong and likely dominant environmental factor. In the
primary analysis, both major direct genetic effects (associations)
as well as prevalent genotypeienvironment interactions have
been reported (Smith and Kruglyak, 2008).

LIMMI accurately recovers the genotypeienvironment inter-
actions with a measured environmental factor We applied
LIMMI and LIMMI-sva to the yeast dataset without providing
knowledge about the measured environmental factor that corres-
ponds to the growth medium as an input. SVA identiﬁed nine
latent factors, and LIMMI found 15 factors. When considering
each learnt factor to test for genotypeienvironment interactions
with individual gene expression levels, LIMMI-sva retrieved a
larger number of genes with signiﬁcant effects than LIMMI
(Fig. 3a, at comparable statistical calibration; see Supplementary

The number of genes with at least one signiﬁcant genotypanironment
interaction (FDR 5 0.01) as identiﬁed by LIMMI and SVA. The ﬁrst
factor was most correlated with the measured ethanol/glucose contrast,
capturing this experimental condition. (b) ROC curves for LIMMI-sva
and LIMMI, assessing the accuracy of recovering pairs of genetic loci and
genes in statistical interactions with the ﬁrst factor. Ground truth infor-
mation was derived from genotype—environment tests with the measured
environment (FDR 5 0.01). The dashed line indicates the accuracy of a
random predictor

Figs S5 and S6). For both methods, the factor with the
greatest number of genotype/factor interactions was strikingly
correlated (r 3 0.99) with the known environmental state that
corresponds to the ethanol/ glucose condition. Other factors
were largely uncorrelated with this known environmental vari-
able (Supplementary Fig. S7), suggesting that the first factor
indeed captures most of the effect due to the ethanol/glucose
condition.

First, we focused on the recovered factor that is a likely proxy
for the true environmental state. Figure 3b depicts the ROC
curve, assessing the accuracy of genotypeienvironment inter-
actions recovered by LIMMI and LIMMI-sva when using geno-
typeienvironment effects with the known environment as ground
truth (as done in Smith and Kruglyak, 2008). LIMMI outper-
formed LIMMI—sva, which is likely due to a combination of two
important differences between these methods. First, LIMMI in-
corporates a constraint such that recovered factors are uncorre-
lated with genotype, whereas many of the factors retrieved by
SVA are themselves under genetic control (Supplementary
Fig. S8). Second, the statistical test for interactions used in
LIMMI accounts for direct effects of all other learnt factors,
explaining away nuisance variation due to other environmental
axes (Section 2.3.1). To investigate this further, we considered
different variants of LIMMI-sva where alternative testing strate-
gies were compared. Despite some improvement, this adjustment
alone did not cure the inferior performance of LIMMI-sva
(Supplementary Fig. S1), suggesting that both the lower extent
of genetic correlation and the reﬁned testing procedure contrib-
ute to the performance of LIMMI.

Novel genotypeienvironment interactions with unknown environ-
mental eﬂects In addition to interactions that correspond to the
known environmental factor of the glucose/ethanol contrast,
both LIMMI-sva and LIMMI retrieved additional factors, which
were considered for possible G x E interactions (Fig. 3a). The
factors recovered by LIMMI-sva tended to be in strong associ-
ation with genotype, suggesting that they capture genetic signals
instead of environmental effects. The factors retrieved by
LIMMI, in contrast, were found to be orthogonal to the genetic
signal (Supplementary Fig. S8).

A map of the genetic loci and regulated genes for interactions
with all factors detected by LIMMI is shown in Figure 4
(interaction results for each individual factor are given in
Supplementary Fig. S9). Notably, genotypewnvironment inter-
actions with the factor that recapitulates the ethanol/glucose
effect (factor 0) were enriched in the proximity of the regulated
genes, suggesting a cis mechanism. Other factors yielded inter-
actions that involve distal loci, and hence have a putative trans
mechanism (Supplementary Table S1). A particularly prominent
hotspot appeared for factor 13 in chromosome 4, where LIMMI
detected genotypeienvironment interactions involving 10 distinct
SNPs in that region. In the direct vicinity of these SNPs
(:I:10kb), there were six annotated genes, four of which have
previously been reported as implicated with temperature re-
sponse OIDL143W, YDL139C, YDL135C, YDL132W)
(Auesukaree et al., 2009; Patton et al., 1998; Shimon et al.,
2008; Stoler et al., 2007; Tiedje et al., 2008). This enrichment
suggests that factor 13 may explain subtle temperature variation
in the experiment. Corresponding maps that reﬂect the inter-
actions retrieved by LIMMI-sva are given in Supplementary

Genomic position (SNP)

Fig. 4. Genomic map of the genotype—environment interactions retrieved
by LIMMI (FDR 5 0.01). Shown are the positions of the SNP (x-axis)
and the gene (y-axis) that participate in each signiﬁcant genotypeenvir-
onment interaction. Red circles correspond to interactions with the ﬁrst
latent factor that captures the known ethanol/ glucose contrast. Blue inter-
actions correspond to all other 14 factors

Figure S10, whereas Supplementary Figure S11 depicts the inter-
action map when using the known environmental condition (glu-
cose/ethanol) to test for genotypewnvironment interactions. The
results obtained in the latter are remarkably similar to the ones
obtained to LIMMI interactions on Factor 0, which is in line
with the ROC analyses discussed earlier (Fig. 3b). Overall,
LIMMI identiﬁed more trans bands for genotypewnvironment
effects than LIMMI-sva.

Genotypeenvironment interaction hotspot may confound gen-
etic association analyses Finally, we considered the ability of dif-
ferent models to call direct eQTL associations between genetic
loci and individual gene expression levels. Figure 5 shows the
number of associations retrieved by alternative methods as a
function of the FDR cutoff. As in the simulated settings
(Fig. 2), LIMMI accounts for the interaction effects found,
which controls for nuisance variation due to these effects. As a
result, LIMMI identified additional cis eQTLs, while the number
of trans eQTLs decreased when compared with PANAMA. At
the same time, the P—value statistics of LIMMI was slightly more
uniform than PANAMA, suggesting that better control for con-
founding has been achieved (Supplementary Figs S5 and S6).
While more uniform P—values support an improved calibration
(Listgarten et al., 2010) of the methods presented here, some
inﬂation of the test statistics was retained, which is an expected
consequence of the presence of extensive trans hotspots (see Fusi
et al., 2012, for a discussion). These results suggest that including
interaction terms into the model can also be beneﬁcial to identify
direct genetic effects in real studies. On one hand, this ﬁnding
supports the conjecture that the interactions retrieved by LIMMI
are indeed genuine, as they explain variance that cannot be cap-
tured by a model that relies on fully additive effects. On the other
hand, it is clear that genotypewnvironment effects contribute to
gene expression variability, and accounting for their effect in
genetic analyses has similar beneﬁts than accounting for

(Price et al., 2006, 2010). eQTLs retrieved by LIMMI have a
slightly better cis enrichment compared with PANAMA, a cri-
terion previously suggested to judge the plausibility of eQTL
results (Fusi et al., 2012; Kang et al., 2008a; Listgarten et al.,
2010).

4 DISCUSSION

Here, we have presented a novel approach to detect genotypei
environment interactions with unmeasured environmental fac-
tors. LIMMI is able to recover the unmeasured environmental
state solely from gene expression data. Once learnt, these vari-
ables can be used in genetic analyses to investigate interactions
between environmental factors and genotype with a regulatory
effect on gene expression traits.

Approaches like LIMMI are relevant for virtually any genetic
study of high-dimensional molecular traits, in particular if the
environmental state is only partially measured or remains en-
tirely unknown (Gibson, 2008). Here, we illustrated and assessed
LIMMI in simulated examples and in retrospective analyses of
data from yeast genetics. We compared genotypewnvironment
interactions with learnt environments with interactions found
when using explicit environmental measurements. First,
LIMMI was able to accurately detect previously known inter-
actions. Second, we found novel genotypewnvironment inter-
actions beyond what can be detected when relying on the
measured environmental state. These additional effects were pre-
dominantly trans—acting, with some loci having widespread ef-
fects on large fractions of the expression traits. In the case of the
largest hotspot, the interacting locus overlapped with a group of
genes involved in temperature sensitivity, providing a plausible
explanation of the mechanistic underpinning of this finding.
Finally, we have shown how the recovered interactions can be
used to reﬁne statistical testing procedures. Accounting for the
effect of genotypewnvironment interactions within a LIMMI
eQTL scan resulted in increased power to detect true associations
in simulations and yielded improved test statistics on real data.

LIMMI is related to a range of existing factor models, in par-
ticular techniques that model hidden expression determinants to
correct for their confounding effect. These methods can be
broadly grouped in two classes: models that are aimed at retriev-
ing a set of confounding factors explicitly (Fusi et al., 2012;

Detecting regulatory gene-environment interactions

 

Leek and Storey, 2007; Stegle et al., 2010) and models that ac-
count for the variance introduced by confounding factors (Kang
et al., 2008a; Listgarten et al., 2010). In principle, any of the
models that retrieve an explicit representation of factors can be
used for interaction analyses like the one presented here.
Speciﬁcally, in this article, we implemented a version of our
method that was using SVA for this purpose. LIMMI is most
closely related and builds on PANAMA (Fusi et al., 2012); how-
ever, we propose a new route toward understanding the role of
the environment in a genetic context rather than merely ‘correct-
ing it away’. For this purpose, we extend PANAMA in several
ways. First, we introduce a systematic approach to use inferred
environments to test for genotypewnvironment interactions
while accounting for the effect of unknown environments.
Second, we show how the detected genotypewnvironment inter-
actions can be used to further refine the statistical testing of
eQTLs. Other methods like SVA (Leek and Storey, 2007),
PEER (Stegle et al., 2012) and the method by Listgarten et al.
(Listgarten et al., 2010) do not focus on recovering interactions
per se, although we have created a modiﬁed variant of SVA for
the purpose of comparison. The main shortcoming of these tech-
niques is the lack of an effective mechanism to ensure that the
learnt factors are not driven by genotype, which leads to the
inferior performance of LIMMI-sva in our experiments.

In conclusion, LIMMI is a methodological advance that
allows for refined inference of environmental factors from mo-
lecular proﬁling data. When used in genetic analyses, these learnt
variables help to improve the mechanistic understanding of mo-
lecular traits, thereby increasing the fraction of phenotype vari-
ability that can be explained. Approaches as the one presented
here will become even more useful when dataset sizes increase
further, providing sufﬁcient power to estimate even more com-
plex models and effect types between the genetic state, known
and hidden environments and the transcriptional state of the cell.

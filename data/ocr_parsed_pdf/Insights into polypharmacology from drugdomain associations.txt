Polypharmacology from protein domains

 

may be related to the proteins sharing a common domain
that the drug may be targeting. In this work, we attempt to
unravel the association between drugs and protein domains to
address the hypothesis that protein domains are the areas on
which drugs act and are an important factor in the polypharma—
cological behaviour of most drugs.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data retrieval

We compiled a drugitarget interaction dataset for human proteins using
interaction data from the databases DrugBank (Knox et al., 2010),
STITCH (Kuhn et al., 2008) and MATADOR (Gunther et al., 2008).
We ﬁltered the drugitarget interactions from DrugBank to exclude nutra-
ceutical compounds and to include only approved and experimental
drugs labelled with a PubChem Compound identiﬁer. High-conﬁdence
drugitarget interactions from STITCH and MATADOR were added to
our data to obtain a comprehensive non-redundant set of drugitarget
interactions for human proteins. The CATH and PFAM domain com-
positions for each target protein were obtained from Gene3D (release
10.2) and BioMart (Guberman et al., 2011), respectively.

2.2 Scoring and evaluation of drug—domain associations

Each drug that interacts with a protein in our initial dataset is associated
with all the domains that comprise the protein. We formulated a scoring
scheme based on the information content of a drug associated with a
domain, i.e. the self-information of each drugdomain pair from all the
possible drugidomain pairs. The self-information for a drugﬂomain
pair, taken from the mathematical theory of information, is deﬁned as

 

nd nD
1(dD) = -10g2 P(d, D), P(d, D) =17(d) -17(D) =  - (2 D)
where P(d,D) is the probability of ﬁnding a drug (d) associated to a
domain (D), and nd and nD are the number of times that drugs and
domains, respectively, appear in the dataset. We calculate the score (5) for
each drugﬂomain pair in our network as

s(dD) = N(dD) . I(dD)

where N ( dD ) is the number of times the pair dB is in the network.

Random drugidomain networks were computed by shufﬂing the ini-
tial drugitarget interactions and keeping the same CATH and PFAM
domain composition for each target. For each drugﬂomain pair in our
network, we obtained a distribution of scores computed from the random
networks in which the particular drugidomain pair was found. Thus, for
each drugﬂomain pair, we have a score and a distribution of 25 random
scores. We computed the probability that each score was included in the
distribution of random scores using a statistical t-test. Using a P-value
threshold of 0.001, we could assess whether a drugﬂomain association
was likely to occur by chance.

2.3 Domain co-occurrence network

Two domain co-occurrence networks were built using the CATH and
PFAM domain composition for each protein in the drugiprotein inter-
action dataset. Two domains in the network are linked if they appear in
the same protein.

2.4 Evolutionary analysis of drug targets

Protein sequences of human GPCRs and kinases were obtained based on
the presence of characteristic CATH domains in the human proteome
and aligned with ClustalW (Larkin et al., 2007). We obtained the phylo-
genetic distance from each tree and built one network for each target class

in the sequence similarity space. In these networks, nodes represent pro-
tein sequences, and two nodes are linked if the phylogenetic distance
between the proteins is <0.75.

Data retrieval, network building and analysis were performed using
the Ruby and Python scripting languages and the Networkx Python
module (http://networkx.lanl.gov/). Bipartite graph analyses were per-
formed with Cytoscape and with the BipartiteNet plugin developed by
our group.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Modelling the drug—domain networks

Our initial dataset comprises 5531 drugs, 3580 proteins and
12 754 drugiprotein interactions. We have considered two com—
plementary perspectives on protein domains: the structural per—
spective provided by CATH (Orengo et al., 1997) and the
function—oriented perspective offered by PFAM (Finn et al.,
2010).

With our scoring scheme based on the statistics of domain
occurrence in the protein targets of each drug, we provide reli—
able drugidomain associations for 26.05% (CATH) and 27.78%
(PFAM) of the drugs in the initial drugiprotein interaction
dataset. Our drug4lomain network models include only the
drug4lomain associations that are more likely to appear than
those expected at random (P—value = 0.001), based on the statis—
tical meaning of the occurrence of every possible drug4lomain
pair.

To provide a meaningful comparison of the drugdomain as—
sociations with the drugiprotein interactions, we built drugipro—
tein subnetworks for the drugs that we can associate with the
PFAM and CATH domains. Table 1 shows the global properties
of the resulting drug4lomain and drugiprotein bipartite
networks.

3.2 Druggable domains

The drug average degree indicates that drugidomain networks
tend to be organized around particular druggable domains that
draw together most of the drugs. We checked this ﬁnding by
examining the network heterogeneity and the clustering coeffi—
cient of the drug4lrug projections. Monopartite projections of
the drug4lomain and drugiprotein networks (where drugs are
nodes and two drugs are connected by an edge if they share at
least one target in the corresponding bipartite network) contain
information about how drugs are targeting the same proteins (or
domains). Projections from drug4lomain networks tend to have
fewer hubs and more clusters than those from drugiprotein net—
works, as shown in Table 2.

When we compared the drugidomain bipartite networks with
the drugiprotein bipartite subnetworks, it was clear that drugs
revolve around a privileged set of targets to a greater extent in
the former. We aimed to identify these druggable domains as
proxies for the druggable genome. Hopkins and Groom (2002)
used drug—binding domain annotations to identify the druggable
protein families in the human genome. Our drug4lomain asso—
ciations revealed roughly the same description of the druggable
genome.

Polypharmacology from protein domains

 

of druggable domains with our automatic method. We found
that drugs tend to revolve around a privileged set of domains,
as can be observed in the drug4lomain bipartite networks and
can be deduced from the monopartite projections of the drugi
domain and drugiprotein networks. Network heterogeneity re—
ﬂects the tendency of a network to contain hub nodes; a drugi
drug projection of a bipartite network with a low heterogeneity
reﬂects a trend in which drugs are organized around a privileged
set of targets. This is the case for the drugidrug projections of
both drug4lomain networks when compared with their corres—
ponding drugprotein subnetworks, as shown in Table 2.

Drug degree distributions (particularly in drug4lomain net—
works), after we corrected for the co—occurrence of domains in
the same proteins, clearly show that drugs target domains in a
more specific way than they target proteins. Different domain
targets for a polypharmacological drug tend to cluster in the
same modules, within domain interaction networks such as
DOMINE. These domains, and in particular co—occurring do—
mains, can be interpreted as a single module or as a single
pharmacological target, in the same sense that protein complexes
are considered as drug targets in the work of Nacher and
Schwartz (2012).

To get a hint of the evolutionary perspective of druggable
domains, we selected polypharmacological drugs that target the
two main families of druggable proteins, as described by
Hopkins et a]. (2002) in the druggable genome, i.e. GPCRs
and kinases. Although both doxepin and staurosporine can be
associated with protein domains that are archetypical for each
protein class, the targets of doxepin are closely related in the
GPCRs phylogenetic tree, whereas the targets of staurosporine
are widespread in the human kinome. These two examples illus—
trate a difference in the subfamily targeting speciﬁcity of the
selected drugs and suggest further studies, such as the implica—
tions in drug polypharmacology of the evolutionary conservation
of structural domains (with particular focus on binding site con—
servation) and the structural similarity of domains for distinct
targets.

Our results support the idea that protein domains are a good
proxy for drug targets when considering the structural and func—
tional perspectives of their deﬁnition. Hence, drug polypharma—
cology, understood as the ability of a single drug to bind several
proteins, emerges as a consequence of the multidomain compos—
ition of proteins.

Frequent glycan structure mining of influenza virus increased viral infection

 

2 BACKGROUND

2.1 Glycan arrays

The study of glycan binding patterns has been much aided by the
development of glycan arrays (Galustian et al., 2004) and the
availability of such data on the web (Blixt et al., 2004; Raman
et al., 2005). For example, the CFG provides mammalian glycan
arrays to analyze the glycan binding speciﬁcity of lectins, anti—
bodies, antisera, microorganisms and viruses, to name a few.
Samples are ﬂuorescently labeled to detect primary binding to
the glycans on the array. To generate the array, a library of
natural and synthetic mammalian glycans with amino linkers is
printed onto N—hydroxysuccinimide—activated glass microscope
slides (SCHOTT Nexterion), forming covalent amide linkages.
The current CFG glycan arrays contain >600 glycan structures,
as listed at http://www.functionalglycomics.org/static/consor
tium/resources/resourcecoreh8.shtml. Among these structures,
~10% are sulfated structures. Previous studies using glycan
arrays have conﬁrmed that SA is an important component in
inﬂuenza virus binding (Stevens et al., 2006). It has also been
shown using a solid—phase binding assay that 6—sulfo sialyl Lewis
X is recognized by H5, H6, H7 and H9 influenza viruses
(Gambaryan et al., 2008). Therefore, the data from these tech—
nologies have been shown to be effective in analyzing glycan
binding afﬁnity.

2.2 Enzymes involved in glycan structure synthesis

The glycan structures expressed on the cell surface are synthe—
sized in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus by
a series of glycosyltransferases and sulfotransferases.
Overexpression or RNA interference of a glycosyltransferase or
a sulfotransferase is generally used to remodel glycan structures
on the cell surface (Hirano et al., 2012; Sasaki et al., 2011). For
example, overexpression of a sulfotransferase can increase a spe—
ciﬁc sulfation on a saccharide core (Hirano et al., 2012).
Therefore, in this work, to perform our viral infection experi—
ment, in preparing the cell culture, it was important to identify
those structures in the extracted data for which glycosyltrans—
ferases and/or sulfotransferases were known.

2.3 Data mining for glycan analysis

The Resource for INformatics of Glycomes at Soka (RINGS) is
a web resource providing a variety of data mining and algorith—
mic tools for glycomics data analysis (Akune et al., 2010). The
data mining method we used in this work is implemented by the
Glycan Miner Tool (Aoki—Kinoshita, 2013) in RINGS. This tool
uses the a—closed frequent subtree algorithm (Hashimoto et al.,
2008) for glycan structures. Details of this algorithm are
provided in Methods.

For the data, we used the glycan array data of influenza
viruses from the CFG (Blixt et al., 2004). In particular, we
selected the data for H1 and H3 inﬂuenza viruses that were
associated with the epidemics from 1977 until now. In addition,
we selected the data for H5 inﬂuenza viruses because the ﬁrst
human infections with chicken H5 viruses were reported in 1997
in Hong Kong. These viruses were readily available, such that
viral infection experiments could be performed using them.

2.4 Glycan structure notation

The graphical notation of glycan structures in this work is based on
the symbols proposed by the CFG. In particular, each monosac—
charide making up glycans is depicted by each given symbol. Thus,
a glycan structure is represented as a tree structure, where nodes are
monosaccharides (or sugars) and edges are glycosidic linkages
(including an a or ﬂ anomer and two numbers indicating the linkage
positions on each sugar). Table 1 lists the symbols and abbreviated
names for the monosaccharides that appear in this manuscript.

Glycan structures may be represented using a variety of text
formats. In this work, we used KEGG Chemical Function
(KCF) format for the input data to the Glycan Miner Tool,
which we obtained by converting from International Union of
Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) format, which is the
format used by the CFG. Details of these and other formats
can be found in Aoki—Kinoshita, 2010. In brief, KCF format
uses a graph notation for glycans by specifying monosaccharides
as nodes and glycosidic linkages as edges. It also requires the
speciﬁcation of x— and y—coordinates for each node so that struc—
tures can be drawn clearly on a 2D plane. On the other hand,
IUPAC format is a linear notation where branches are indicated
by parentheses. RINGS provides utilities to convert glycan struc—
tures between a number of different formats, and the IUPAC to
KCF converter was used in this work.

3 METHODS
3.1 Glycan array data

The glycan array data from the CFG were used as the data source for
glycan binding afﬁnity information of various inﬂuenza strains. We ﬁrst
selected all virus-binding array data, which resulted in 191 datasets.
Among these, those virus strains for which virus experiments were feasible
were selected, resulting in 15 wild-type strains as listed in Table 2. We then
selected those glycans that demonstrated high binding afﬁnity in each
dataset (provided in Supplementary Information). The smallest number
of selected glycans was 8 (human HlNl; A/South Carolina/ 1 / 1918) and
the largest was 40 [Equine H3N8; A/equine/MA/2003 (H3N8)]. The
human H1N1 virus strains bound to 15 glycans on average. Table 2
also lists the number of glycans selected from each dataset. In general,
the top binding glycans were selected, except for those whose structures
were not given, such as ‘Fibrinogen’ and ‘Transferrin.’ The glycan struc-
ture data provided by the CFG are provided in IUPAC format, so it was
necessary to convert them to KCF format such that they could be input
into the Glycan Miner Tool. Once this was done using the IUPAC to
KCF utility in RINGS, and the structures were conﬁrmed to be accurately
converted, the data were then ready to be analyzed.

3.2 Glycan Miner Tool

The Glycan Miner Tool implements the oz-closed frequent subtree algo-
rithm (Hashimoto et al., 2008) for glycan structures. In brief, oz-closed
frequent subtrees are deﬁned as those substructures within the input
dataset that frequently appear (more than a speciﬁed minimum threshold,
called the minimum support, or mimup). Those subtrees that appear in at
least mimup number of input glycan structures are considered to be fre-
quent subtrees. Moreover, to avoid the retrieval of overly similar subtrees,
the parameter at was deﬁned to specify the amount of overlap allowed
among the retrieved subtrees. Thus, the following condition must be met
for a subtree T to be included in the results:

support (P) < max (a >x< support (T), mimup,

where P is a supertree of Tand support()() refers to the number of times
subtree X appears in the input dataset.

The Glycan Miner Tool returns the oz-closed frequent subtrees in order
of P-value, which is computed based on the input data. This P-value is
obtained by computing the support of randomly generated structures
with similar topology to the target subtree. Then the probability of ob-
taining the target subtree among the randomly generated subtrees is
computed.

3.3 Cell line and culture

Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells were acquired from the
Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources Cell Bank (JCRB9029).
MDCK cells were cultured in Eagle’s minimal essential medium contain-
ing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotic at 370C under 5% C02
atmospheric conditions.

3.4 Establishment of stable transformant

expressing hGlcNAc6S T -1
The vector construction for the expression of human GlcNAc-6-sulfbtrans-
ferase-IUiGlcNAc6ST-1) (Uchimura and Rosen, 2006) was prepared ac-
cording to Invitrogen GATEWAY systems by two-step polymerase chain

reaction (PCR). The full-length open reading frame of hGlcNAc6ST-1
was ampliﬁed from EST clone 4562846 (supplied by Open Biosystems),
by using the forward primer, 5’-AAAAAGCAGGCTTGGCCGCCA
CCATGAAGGTGTTCCGTAGGAAGG-3’ and reverse primer,
5’-AGAAAGCTGGGTTTAGAGACGGGGCTTCCG-3’. For addition
of the adaptor sequence necessary to GATEWAY system, the open read-
ing frame fragment was ampliﬁed again by using the forward primer,
5’-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCT—3’ and reverse
primer, 5’-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGT—3’. The
ampliﬁed fragment was recombined with the pCXN2 expression vector
modiﬁed for GATEWAY system to yield pCXN2-hGlcNAc6ST-1.
MDCK cells were seeded at 4 >< 105 cells/well in a 12-well plate 24h
before transfection. The 3 ug of pCXN2-hGlcNAc6ST-1 or pCXN2 (for
mock transfectant) was mixed with 971.1 of Lipofectamine2000 (Life
Technologies, CA, USA) in 200 ul of Opti-MEM medium (Life
Technologies) and transfected to MDCK cells. From lday after trans-
fection, cells were cultured in growth medium containing 0.4 ug/ml G418
for selection of the transformants. The transformant cells were passed
every 341 days for 20 days, and the increase of hGlcNAc6ST-1 gene ex-
pression was checked. Flow cytometry analysis was performed by using
MECA-79 monoclonal antibody (SC-19602, Santa Cruz, TX, USA),
which is known to recognize 6-sulfo GlcNAc structures (Yeh et 01., 2001).

3.5 Viral infection to cells and measurement of the
amount of viral gene in culture supernatant

A human inﬂuenza virus, A/Hokkaido/11/2002 (HlNl), was inoculated
into cells at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01 in Eagle’s Minimal Essential
Medium containing antibiotic (minimal medium). After incubation at
370C for 1h, the cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline,
and cultured in minimal medium with presence of 1 ug/ml of acetyltryp-
sin (SIGMA, MO, USA). At 48 and 72h post-infection, culture super-
natants were harvested. Viral RNA was extracted from 140 ul of the
supernatant using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Venlo,
The Netherlands) according to the manufacture’s protocol. These RNA
were eluted in a ﬁnal volume of 7071.1 of RNase-free water contains
0.04% sodium azide, and a portion was subjected to real-time reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using LightCycler 480
Instrument (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Primers used to quantitate the
amount of matrix (M) gene of virus were forward: 5’-CCMAGGTCG
AAACGTAYGTTCTCTCTCTATC-3’, reverse: 5’-TGACAGRATYG
GTCTTGTCTTTAGCCAYTCCA-3’, probe: 5’-ATYTCGGCTTTGA
GGGGGCCTG-3’. The probe was labeled at the 5’-end with the reporter
dye, 3FAM, and at the 3’-end with the quencher dye, MGB. Reactions
were performed using QuantiTect Probe RT—PCR Kit (QIAGEN) as
follows: reverse transcription, 30 min at 500C; ampliﬁcation, 50 cycles
of 15 s at 940C and 75s at 540C.

4 RESULTS
4.1 Glycan Miner Tool analysis

Table 2 shows the parameters used in analyzing the glycan array
data. For each dataset, a value for a and minimum support
minsup was selected such that the number of subtrees extracted
was within the range of $10. In general, a ranged from 0.7 to 0.9
and minsup ranged from three to seven.

Screenshots of all of the analysis results are provided in
Supplementary information. Here, we describe the results that
were used as the basis of selecting sulfotransferase in the viral
infection experiment; in particular, we focused on the human
HlNl virus strains A/Texas/36/l99l and A/New York/l/l9l8.
Figures 1 and 2 are snapshots of these results, respectively.

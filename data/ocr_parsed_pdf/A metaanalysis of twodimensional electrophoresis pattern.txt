ABSTRACT
Motivation: The two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) pattern of
proteins is thought to be specifically related to the physiological or
pathological condition at the moment of sample preparation. On this
ground, most proteomic studies move to identify specific hallmarks
for a number of different conditions. However, the information
arising from these investigations is often incomplete due to inherent
limitations of the technique, to extensive protein post-translational
modifications and sometimes to the paucity of available samples.
The meta-analysis of proteomic data can provide valuable
information pertinent to various biological processes that otherwise
remains hidden.
Results: Here, we show a meta-analysis of the PD protein DJ-1
in heterogeneous 2-DE experiments. The protein was shown to
segregate into specific clusters associated with defined conditions.
Interestingly, the DJ-1 pool from neural tissues displayed a
specific and characteristic molecular weight and isoelectric point
pattern. Moreover, changes in this pattern have been related
to neurodegenerative processes and aging. These results were
experimentally validated on human brain specimens from control
subjects and PD patients.

1 INTRODUCTION

DJ-l/PARK7 is an ubiquitous, highly conserved protein that was
originally identiﬁed because of its ability to transform NIH3T3
mouse cells in cooperation with Ras (Nagakubo et (11., 1997).
Starting from the association between loss-of—function mutations in

the DJ-l gene and PARK7, a monogenic, autosomal-recessive form
of Parkinson’s disease (PD) (Bonifati et (11., 2003), an accumulating
body of evidence pinpointed the important role of DJ-1 in this
neurodegenerative condition. Very recently, it has been shown that
oxidized dopamine can covalently modify DJ-l (Van Laar et (11.,
2009); however, whether this can affect dopamine cell degeneration
is unknown. Some hints may come from the involvement of
DJ-1 into many cellular functions, including evidence linking this
protein to oxidative stress response—a fact well known even
before the association of DJ-1 with PD (Mitsumoto et (11., 2001)—
mitochondrial function (Zhang et (11., 2005) and transcription (Zhong
and Xu, 2008), nuclear transcription (Xu et (11., 2005), mRNA
binding and protein interaction (Hod et (11., 1999; van der Brug
et (11., 2008) and protein degradation (Xiong et (11., 2009). Mirroring
the involvement of DJ-1 in multiple cellular activities, this protein
has been found in complex with multiple molecular partners,
including DJ-l itself (Tao and Tong, 2003), PINK-l and Parkin
(Xiong et (11., 2009), alpha-synuclein (Meulener et (11., 2005), HSP70
(Li et (11., 2005), DJBP (Niki et (11., 2003), PIASx alpha (Takahashi
et (11., 2001), ASKl (Waak et (11., 2009), histone deacetylase 6
(Olzmann et (11., 2007), androgen receptor (Tillman et (11., 2007),
DAXX (Junn et (11., 2005) and Abstrakt (Sekito et (11., 2005).

DJ-l has been shown to modulate dopamine toxicity in cellular
models of oxidative stress with reference to PD (Fasano et (11.,
2008). Dopamine exposure leads to upregulation of DJ-1 that in turn
increases cell resistance to dopamine itself and reduces intracellular
oxidants (Lev et (11., 2008; Lev et (11., 2009). On the other hand,
a-synuclein overexpression leads to upregulation of DJ-1, and DJ -1
overexpression protects cells from a-synuclein toxicity (Batelli
et (11., 2009; Colapinto et (11., 2006; Zhou and Freed, 2005).

Besides being in complex with a number of different partners,
DJ-l is often post-translationally modiﬁed. DJ-l modiﬁcations
mainly include oxidations at different sites, which is related to its
antioxidant role (Choi et (11., 2006; Kinumi et (11., 2004; Mitsumoto
et (11., 2001), but there are also evidences of ubiquitination (Olzmann
et (11., 2004, 2007) and SUMOylation (small ubiquitin-like modiﬁer)
(Shinbo et (11., 2006).

Not unexpectedly, DJ-l binding to its molecular counterparts, and
thus its pleiotropic effects, are affected by DJ-l post-translational
modiﬁcation. For example, oxidation regulates homodimerization
(Ito et (11., 2007) and affects DJ-l binding to mRNA (van der Brug
et (11., 2008), ASKl (Waak et (11., 2009), HSP70 (Li et (11., 2005),

parkin (Moore et (11., 2005), while ubiquitination mediates the
binding to histone deacetylase 6 and thus to the dynein—dynactin
complex (Olzmann et (11., 2007).

Multiple DJ-l modiﬁed forms are simultaneously present, so that
DJ-l can be better considered as a pool of different forms, with
different modiﬁcations and in different amounts. It is very likely
that, instead of the total amount of DJ-1 or of a deﬁned DJ-l
form, the composition of this pool and the precise balance between
different forms is the main factor determining DJ-l global activity.
In particular, alterations of this pool, instead of DJ-1 mutations, are
expected to play a role in those non-genetic conditions correlated to
DJ-l activity, including idiopathic PD. Indeed, since many different
DJ-l forms can be separated on the basis of their isoelectric point
(pI), it is a common ﬁnding that DJ -1 oxidation, correlated to aging,
Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, produces an increase in DJ-l
species of acidic pH, and a decrease in basic species, so that these
conditions are Characterized by a pool of DJ-1 forms different from
that observed in controls (Canet-Aviles et (11., 2004; Choi et (11.,
2006; Meulener et (11., 2006). Ubiquitination and SUMOylation of
DJ-1, on the other side, affects also the molecular weight (MW) of
the modiﬁed species, and are thus separated by mono-dimensional
electrophoresis accordingly (Olzmann et (11., 2004, 2007; Shinbo
et (11., 2006).

While two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) is able in principle
to separate DJ-l modiﬁed forms on the basis of both p1 and MW
Changes, to the best of our knowledge there is no experimental
evaluation of DJ-1 modiﬁcations, which takes into account both
dimensions simultaneously, so as to completely describe the pool of
DJ-1 possible forms and to evaluate the pool composition in a given
condition.

To this purpose, a robust procedure was developed to reevaluate
2-DE experiments available in the literature by automatic alignment.
Since detailed information on experimental conditions, protocols
and samples was available, it was possible to segregate different
DJ-l forms into pools associated with a deﬁned condition
independently by the particular experimental protocols used.
Interestingly, the DJ-l pool from neural tissues, in particular from
brain, displayed a speciﬁc and Characteristic MW and p1 pattern.
Moreover, Changes in this pattern might reﬂect neurodegenerative
processes and aging. These results were experimentally validated
by 2-DE western blotting on human post-mortem brain specimens
from control subjects and PD patients.

2 METHODS
2.1 Search strategy and 2D-gel data extraction

A set of relevant data to be included into the analysis, i.e. 2D-gel
experiments where the protein DJ-l was clearly identiﬁed, was obtained
by extracting the relevant 2D-gel images from Pubmed-indexed Portable
Document Format documents through July 2009. Brieﬂy, we started by
querying Medline for publications indexed with the subject heading DJ-l
or its alias: "PARK7"[All Fields] OR "CTA-215D11.1"[All Fields] OR
"DJ-1"[All Fields] OR "DJ1"[All Fields] OR "FLJ27376"[All Fields] OR
"FLJ34360"[All Fields] OR "RP23-272N19.5"[All Fields]).

As of July, 2009, this query identiﬁed 474 papers. We then proceed to
parsing using Big Faceless Organization software (KSM Ltd, London, UK),
so as to extract the ﬁgures and the ﬁgures captions of the considered papers.

Those ﬁgures containing 2D-gel representations were identiﬁed by a text-
matching procedure, and able to evaluate each caption for the occurrence of

Fig. 1. DJ -1 metagel, derived from 160 different bidimensional experiments,
representing the overall pool of DJ-1 possible forms. Conserved spots are
numbered and bordered in black. The color scale range from blue (spots
poorly represented in the considered experiments) to white (spots very
represented in the considered experiments).

at least one term identiﬁed as connected to a 2D-gel experiment (for the list
of terms used, see Supplementary Table 2). This step led to the identiﬁcation
of 53 ﬁgures from 37 papers, which were automatically segmented to isolate
160 2D-gel images. The 2D-gel sources included in the analysis are listed in
Supplementary Table 2.

2.2 2D-gel alignment and ‘metagel’ production

The 2D-gel images were processed using Image] (National Institutes of
Health) (Girish and Vijayalakshmi, 2004), including DJ-l spots that could
not be directly aligned, given the differences in resolution of the original
ﬁgures and the different pI/MW range represented. Therefore, gel images
were rescaled by calibrating the pixel-to-pI ratio using the following factor:

F =pixpl X W

p1xB — p1x A
where pix,” was the desired resolution in the ﬁnal image (i.e. 400 pixels per
pI unit), p13 and pIA were the pI values of the center of mass of the most basic
and of the most acid spot, respectively, and p13 and pIA the pixel number of
the center of mass of the most basic and of the most acid spot, respectively.
For MW calibration, the average position of the mass center of the four most
intense DJ-l spots was assumed to correspond to the mass reported for DJ -1.

Once rescaled and registered on the reference pI/MW grid, gel images
were background subtracted, segmented for the spots and binarized. To this
aim, a rolling-ball procedure was used ﬁrst (rolling ball radius=50 pixel,
performing a sliding paraboloid), then a watershed segmentation procedure
was applied (smooth radius 5.0, dark objects on bright background,
neighborhood of 8 pixels, minimum level ‘0’, maximum level ‘120’, display
outputs ‘binary image”) and ﬁnally an automatic thresholding to get the
binarized image (Pleissner at (11., 1999).

The 160 binarized images were used to get a ‘metagel’, i.e. an average
intensity projection image, wherein each pixel stores the average intensity
over all images in the 160 original images at corresponding pixel location
(Fig. l). The color scale of this metagel accounts for the occurrence frequency
of each spot in the considered experiments, with less frequent spot positions
in blue and more frequent spot positions in white.

The same approach was used to build two additional ‘metagels’ which
represent all the experiments of Alzheimer’s/PD patient brain (n = 11) and
all the experiments of control human brain origin (n = 12).

The entire procedure is represented as a ﬂowchart in Supplementary
Figure 5.

2.3 ‘Spot matrix’ generation

In order to gain insight on possible correlations between speciﬁc spot patterns
on 2D-gel experiments and biologically relevant information, an objective
matrix was generated to correlate each spot in a given 2D-gel to one of
the reference spot of the metagel, i.e. to one of the DJ-1 forms occurring
in at least 5% of the considered experiments. Brieﬂy, the following, fully
automated procedure was performed: (i) the ‘metagel” was segmented as
described above for the experimental gels; (ii) the Euclidean distance of the
center of mass of each experimental spot from the center of mass of each spot
in the ‘metagel” was calculated; and (iii) a ‘spot matrix” was build, where
rows correspond to two dimensional gel (2D-gel) experiments, and columns
to the spots in the ‘metagel”.

A value of 1 was assigned if the Euclidean distance between any spot
of the considered experiment and the ‘metagel” spot deﬁning the matrix
column was minor or equal to the Feret diameter of the ‘metagel” spot (i.e.
the considered experiment contains a spot that is covered at least partially
by a speciﬁc spot of the ‘metagel”).

The ‘spot matrix” so obtained is thus a synthetic representation of the
occurrence of each spot, identiﬁed in the ‘metagel” and corresponding to
a form of DJ-1 in a given experiment, allowing the description of each
experiment in terms of which DJ -1 forms were present.

2.4 Statistics

The spot matrix was analyzed using the software XLSTAT (Addinsoft, Paris,
France) as described hereafter.

The co-occurrence of different spots was measured to group those spots
which most often are present simultaneously (i.e. to get pools of DJ -1 forms)
according to Pearson”s correlation method applied row by row in the ‘Spot
matrix”: the linear correlation was measured between the presence of a given
spot in a given experiment (expressed by a value of 1 in the corresponding
cell of the spot matrix) and the presence of the other spots in the same
experiment (expressed by the value, 0 or 1, of the other spots in the same
row). The correlation alpha signiﬁcance threshold to include a spot in a pool
was set to 0.01.

Grouping of the considered experiments was achieved by agglomerative
hierarchical clustering in order to put together different experiments on the
basis of the similarity of their vectorial representation in the ‘spot matrix”,
i.e. on the basis of the occurrence of similar spots. The similarity between
experiments was computed as Euclidean distances for each pair of rows in
the ‘spot matrix”. The Euclidean distances ((1) are given for each pair of
rows, A = (a1, a2, ...,a],) and B = (b1, 112, ...,b],), by the equation:

 

where p is the number of columns/variables (19 in our case). The resulting
distance matrix was used to cluster the experiments according to the Ward”s
method (Ward, 1963). Here, the clustering criterion is based on the error
sum of squares, E, which is deﬁned as the sum of the squared distances of
individuals from the center of gravity of the cluster to which they have been
assigned. Initially, E is 0, since every individual is in a cluster of its own.
At each stage, the link created is the one that makes the least increase to E.
Aggregation was stopped by automatic truncation, based on the entropy level,
so to get groups as homogeneous as possible.

2.5 Human substantia nigra specimens

Specimens of human substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) from four
patients having known sporadic PD history and from three unaffected
controls were provided by the Nederlandse Hersenbank (the Netherland”s
Brain Bank, NBB), Amsterdam. Each specimen was accompanied by
histopathological report, showing depletion of pigmented dopaminergic
neurons and the occurrence of extracellular neuromelanin granules as well as
Lewy bodies in surviving neurons of the PD patient. Human brain material

was obtained Via the rapid autopsy system of the NBB that supplies post-
mortem specimens from clinically well documented and neuropathologically
conﬁrmed cases. For the staging of pathological hallmarks, a combination of
parameters was applied (Braak at (11., 2003; RaVid at (11., 1998). Details are
given in Table 1. Autopsies were performed on donors from whom written
informed consent was obtained either from the donor or direct next of kin.
In agreement with Dutch law, no ethics statement is required. All research
involving human brain material, however, was conducted according to the
ethical declaration of the NBB. Human brain tissue specimens (0.5417 g)
were homogenized (20 up-and-down strokes with a Teﬂon homogenizer
followed by ﬁve passages through a 22-gauge needle) in 3 ul UTC (7M Urea,
2M Thiourea, 4% CHAPS) lysis solution per mg tissue. After centrifugation
at 21 000g for 30 min at 20°C, supernatants were recovered; protein content
was estimated with the Bradford assay.

2.6 2D-electrophoresis experiments

Immobilized pH gradients (IPG) strips, IPG buffer, acrylamide and
polyvinyldiﬂuoridene membranes were from GE Healthcare,
Uppsala, Sweden. The Bradford assay for protein concentration
determination was from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules, CA, USA).
The chemiluminescence western blotting detection system (SuperSignal
West Pico Chemiluminescent) was from Pierce Biotechnology, Inc.
(Rockford, IL, USA). Anti-DJ-l monoclonal antibody was from Medical
and Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan. All other reagents were
cell-culture grade from Sigma (St Louis, MO, USA) and were used without
further puriﬁcation.

2-DE was performed according to Jacobs (Jacobs at (11., 2001), with some
modiﬁcations. Samples (100 ug) were diluted to 250 ul with UTC containing
0.5% immobilized pH gradient (IPG) buffer 3710, 2 mM tributylphosphine
and traces of bromophenol blue, and loaded on 13 cm IPG DryStrips with a
non-linear 3710 pH gradient by in-gel rehydration. Isoelectrofocusing was
performed at 22°C on IPGphor (GE Healthcare) according to the following
schedule: 1h at 0V, 10h at 30V, 1h at 200V, 30 min linear gradient to
3500V. 3 h at 3500 V, 2 h and 30 min of linear gradient to 8000V and 6h at
8000 V. Prior to sodium dodecyl sulphateipolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDsiPAGE), the IPG strips were equilibrated for 2 X 30 min in 50 mM Trisi
HCl pH 8.8, 6M urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS and traces of bromophenol
blue containing 1% dithiothreitol for the ﬁrst equilibration step and 2.5%
iodoacetamide for the second one. SDsiPAGE was performed using 12.5%
polyacrylamide gels without stacking gel with the Hoefer SE 600 system
(GE Healthcare).

The second dimension was carried out at 15 mA/gel for 15 min and at
45 mA/gel, at 16°C, until the bromophenol dye front had migrated to the
lower end of the gels. Carbamylated p1 and MW markers (GE Healthcare)
were used for 2-DE calibration. Gels were transferred to PVDF membranes
at 1.5 mA/cm2 for 1 h, 4°C.

2D gel meta-analysis

 

Membranes were saturated in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in tris
buffered saline and tween (TBS-T) (0.5 M Tris, pH 7.4, 2 M NaCl and 0.1%
Tween-20) and incubated with anti-DJ-l monoclonal antibody (1 ug/ml in
1% BSA TBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then washed
with TBS-T and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse-IgG
antibody (1 :80000 in 1% BSA TBS-T) for chemiluminescence detection.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Two pools of DJ -1 forms are alternatively present

Figure 1 reports the distribution of all the DJ-l major forms
represented in the scientiﬁc literature considered in the present work.
From this Figure, it becomes immediately evident that the protein
was reported with different MWs (20 and 25 kDa).

Correlated DJ-l forms (i.e. DJ-l forms that appear together in
different experiments) were identiﬁed by building the correlation
matrix reported in Figure 2A, where the cells of the matrix are
colored according to the Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient of the
corresponding spot pair (see Section 2). Two groups of spots are
positively correlated: a ﬁrst group, including spots 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and
a second group, including spots 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. Out of 160
experiments considered in the present work, 68 contained at least
one spot of the correlation group 1, and 54 contained at least one
spot from correlation group 2.

Fig. 2. (A) Spot correlation matrix. Cells of the matrix are colored according
to the Pearson”s coefﬁcient of correlation, from blue (negatively correlated
spots) to red (positively correlated spots). White cells represent absence of
correlation between the corresponding spots. (B) The correlation analysis
identiﬁed two groups of positively correlated spots, colored in red and blue,
respectively, which are mutually exclusive. The average MW and p1 of the
two groups is different (heavier and more basic in group 1, lighter and more
acidic in group 2).

The spots in the two groups are separated on the basis of the
apparent MW, because the ﬁrst group includes only DJ-l forms
with MWB25 kDa, while in the second group only forms with
MWB20 kDa are present. Therefore, DJ-l appears either at the
expected MW (MWB20 kDa) or as an heavier, modiﬁed form.
The latter cannot be explained by a different sequence, since
all the species considered in the present study (human, mouse,
ovine and bovine) express a protein of predicted MW8 20 kDa.
Moreover, DJ-l forms with MW8 25 kDa are widely represented
in the considered papers, and therefore they are not correlated with
a particular protocol or a particular laboratory.

The existence of a 25 kDa DJ-l form is documented in the
literature also by a number of one-dimensional western blot
experiments. For example, human DJ -1 of a similar MW appears in
the works of Shinbo (Shinbo et (11., 2006) and Bieler (Bieler et (11.,
2009), and in rat a similarly heavier DJ-l was observed in the work
of Yanagida (Yanagida et (11., 2006). Further support to the existence
of a heavier form of DJ-1 comes from the one-dimensional western
blot reported as quality control by DJ-l commercial antibody
manufacturers (Supplementary Table 3). Again, it appears that,
independently from the particular antibody used, the protein appears
alternatively as a 25 kDa or 20 kDa band. Like the MW, the pI of the
two identiﬁed pools is also different. The average pI of the 25 kDa
pool tends to be more basic, if compared with the average pI of the
20 kDa pool, so that the increase in MW appears to be correlated to
a corresponding increase in pI.

Interestingly, spots that are positively correlated in one group tend
to be negatively correlated with the spots of the other group, so that
the two identiﬁed pools are mutually exclusive. This fact could be
due to at least one kind of post-translational modiﬁcation of DJ-1,
Changing the mass of the protein, which acts like an alternative
switch. The functional meaning of this switch will be investigated
in ﬁiture studies.

3.2 DJ -1 patterns in 2D-gel experiments are
reminiscent of the tissutal origin of the sample

To ascertain whether the identiﬁed pools have any biological
relevance, all the experiments (i.e. all the 2-DE patterns) were
grouped according to their similarity in terms of Euclidean distances
between the corresponding rows in the ‘spot matrix”, and then
the experiments were aggregated on the basis of the described
procedure. The resulting dendrogram is reported in Figure 3. Most
of the experiments segregates into two groups: one contains mainly

2-DE gels from ‘human, brain” samples (Cluster 2, including neural
cell lines), while the other contains experiments of heterogeneous,
mostly non-neural and/or non-human origin (Cluster 1). Moreover,
there is a separate ‘non-neural” Cluster (Cluster 3), which contains
experiments coming from a single paper, with an overall DJ-l pattern
not supported by any other paper and consequently suspicious
of experimental biases. For this reason, we did not consider this
Cluster further. Interestingly, the ‘human, neural” Cluster 2 contains
only three samples originating from cellular lines (dopaminergic
neuroblastoma M17 line), while all the other 23 experiments in this
Cluster are 2-DE conducted on proteins from human brain.

Once the experiments were grouped, it was possible to verify
whether the Clusters formed on the basis of the similarity between the
images could be supported also by some non-biological bias (such
as the paper of origin of the images, the authors of the experiments
and the particular protocol used). The latter hypothesis would imply
either that the results are strongly dependent on the particular author
presenting them (i.e. they are not reproduced by others) or they are
extremely sensitive to the experimental conditions used (i.e. they are
not reproducible). Beside the aforementioned bias in Cluster 3, both
Clusters 1 and 2 contain experiments from different papers, with
different staining procedures, so that neither of these bias factors
could explain the different DJ-l patterns responsible for the observed
Clustering.

Therefore, it is possible to distinguish, at least in humans, the
brain origin of DJ-1 on the basis of its 2-DE pattern, i.e. there is a
speciﬁc experimental pattern associated with DJ-l of human brain
or1g1n.

3.3 The pool containing lighter, more acidic forms of
DJ -1 is prevalent in neural tissues

We further proceeded to verify whether the 2-DE gel patterns
responsible for Clusterization in Figure 3 corresponded to the pools
of correlated DJ-l forms identiﬁed in Figure 2. Interestingly, all the
experiments included in Cluster 2 contained spots from correlation
group 2, Characterized by a MW 8 20 kDa and a more acid average
pI (see Fig. 2B); moreover, none of these experiments contained any
spot from correlation group 1 (MW8 25 kDa). Conversely, all the
experiments included in Cluster 1 contained spots from correlation
group 1, which has a MW 8 25 kDa and does not contain any spot of
MW 8 20 kDa. Since Cluster 2 groups together with experiments on
human brain samples, there is a pool of DJ-1 isoforms, identiﬁed
in Figure 2B as group 2, that is typical of neural samples and
particularly of DJ-1 from brain. Thus, it appears that the post-
translational modiﬁcation responsible for the 25 kDa forms is at
best only marginally active in most of the samples of human brain
or1g1n.

3.4 Meta-analysis of DJ -1 modiﬁcations induced by
neurodegeneration and aging

To Check whether any described modiﬁcation of the DJ-l
pool associated with neurodegeneration could be supported
by our meta-analysis, a metagel obtained by all documented
experiments on control human brains (12 experiments) was
compared with the corresponding metagel obtained from patients
with neurodegenerative conditions (11 experiments) (Figure 4A
and B, respectively). According to the source literature, these
experiments are representative of the DJ-l status in 53 control brains

(33 healthy, 20 astrocytoma) and 70 brains from individuals showing
neurodegenerative condition (30 PD, 11 Alzheimer’s disease,
13 progressive supranuclear palsy, 4 corticobasal degeneration
and 12 frontotemporal lobar degeneration). Human brain tissues
display a subset of DJ-1 forms that correlate with the occurrence
of neurodegenerative processes, including PD. In particular, the
frequency of acid forms increases, while the frequency of more
basic forms decreases. Noteworthy, if a single individual is
considered, no speciﬁc form of DJ-1 could be connected to any
neurodegenerative condition. On the contrary, the data reported
herein are referred to the overall patient population, considered in
the source literature.

These ﬁndings are expected on the basis of a speciﬁc accumulation
of DJ-1 acidic forms in the brain of Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s
disease patients, mentioned originally by Bandopadhyay and
coworkers (Bandopadhyay et (11., 2004). Indeed, 10 different DJ-l
forms, including the acidic forms (pI 5.5 and 5.7) of 20 kDa DJ-l
were observed to be selectively accumulated in frontal cortex of
patients compared with age-matched controls (Choi et (11., 2006).

In order to take into account the role of aging, we considered
a couple of DJ-1 patterns from the brains of two old subjects
(age = 92 and 98, respectively) (Meulener et (11., 2006). Also in this
case, the literature hypothesis is conﬁrmed, in that both subjects
possess a DJ-l pool similar to that of PD patients, thus suggesting

an accumulation of oxidized, acidic forms of the protein, which is
related to aging, similar to that observed in PD patients.

3.5 Occurrence of speciﬁc DJ -1 forms associated with
neurodegeneration is conﬁrmed by western blot
analysis of post-mortem specimens of human
substantia nigra

The meta-analysis so far described led us to predict that: (i) the pool
of DJ-1 forms in brain tends to have a weight of ~20 kDa; (ii) PD
patients are expected to have an unbalance toward more acidic forms
of the protein, as previously found in literature.

To experimentally verify this prediction, anti-DJ-l immunoblots
for three controls and three PD patients were performed. Among
them, two were Clinically and histopathologically negative for PD
diagnosis, whereas one of the control subjects showed histological
evidence of mild degeneration although he was Clinically healthy
(C0280). Three patients were included in the PD group after careful
evaluation of Clinical history and neuropathological report.

Two metagels were built for control cases and PD subjects
(Figure 4C and D, respectively). Only 20 kDa species were detected
in both metagels, conﬁrming the predominance of this form in the
brain. For all extracts, three main DJ -1 forms are observed at p1 = 5 .8,
6.1 and 6.4. Despite the limited number of cases, due to difﬁculty
in obtaining human post-mortem samples of substantia nigra, even
in the small population considered, there is some tendency toward
more acidic forms into the PD subjects (arrows in Figure 4C and D).

A confounding factor is due to the inclusion in the control group
of C0280. The DJ-l pattern of this subject is different from other
controls, showing the same acidic forms observed in PD subjects,
and rendering the control metagel somehow more similar to the PD
metagel. Remarkably, this ‘Control” appears positive for the presence
in its brain of tangles (Table 1), a typical hallmark of oxidative stress
and damage in brain, although Lewy bodies were not observed. DJ-l
pool modiﬁcation in this subject might thus be related to some form
of brain damage, without Clinical symptoms.

More specimens would be needed to conﬁrm the outlined picture
of the modiﬁcations of DJ-1 under PD, nevertheless it should be
noted here that the reported pattern is sustained by a number of
publications in a larger population, as previously outlined. Although
we could imagine that in SNpC pf PD patients dopaminergic neurons
are mainly lost, DJ-l oxidative modiﬁcations witness the occurrence
of oxidative stress conditions in the affected area, either it comes
from residual neurons or from astrocytes.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The meta-analysis of proteomic data can provide valuable
information pertinent to various biological processes (or methods
involved) that otherwise remains hidden if a single paper is
considered. The occurrence of frequently identiﬁed proteins, for
instance, may represent common cellular stress responses or simply
reﬂect technical limitations of 2-DE, as recently stated by Petrak
and coworkers in their visionary paper on deja-vu in proteomic
reports (Petrak et (11., 2008). We developed therefore an innovative
procedure to examine the status of DJ-1, a protein extensively
and heterogeneously modiﬁed, by comparing its 2-DE pattern
documented in 160 experiments from 37 different papers. Despite
the presence of many different forms of the protein, with different p1

and MW, it was found that DJ-l main forms consistently associated
with two different pools, with a different MW and average pI. These
two pools are mutually exclusive, and the pool with a MW 8 20 kDa
and a more acid average pI exhibits strong tissue speciﬁcity for brain
and neural models. Moreover, we could show that this pool is indeed
found experimentally in the SNpC of both PD patients and control
subjects and, in agreement with the previous literature, there is a
tendency at the level of population toward more acid forms in PD
patients.

Altogether, these ﬁndings support the value of a proteomic meta-
analysis for the unraveling of complex proteomic signatures and
biomarker analysis.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Despite the importance of using the semantic distance
to improve the performance of conventional expression-based
clustering, there are few freely available software that provides a
clustering algorithm using the ontology-based semantic distances
as prior knowledge. Here, we present the SICAGO (Semi-supervised
Cluster Analysis using semantic distance between gene pairs in Gene
Ontology) system that helps to discover the groups of genes more
effectively using prior knowledge extracted from Gene Ontology.

1 INTRODUCTION

Based on the assumption that genes with similar expression patterns
are more likely to have similar biological functions, many clustering
algorithms have been used to predict the function of a gene
from the known functions of other genes in the cluster. However,
most existing methods are limited in improving the clustering
performance since microarray expression data are noisy. Noise
comes from the damage caused by the experimental device or
observing system error. Thus, it has been observed that some genes
with similar expression patterns do not have common biological
characteristics. In some cases, coregulated genes did not exhibit
similar expression patterns.

New clustering approaches have been proposed to handle
the limitations of the conventional methods. They attempted to
incorporate prior biological knowledge into clustering algorithms,
exploiting known gene functions in the process of clustering. The
machine learning community terms this semi-supervised clustering.
It uses existing domain knowledge to guide the clustering process.
It is observed that incorporating biological knowledge into cluster
analysis is effective in obtaining reliable clustering performance and
interpreting the analysis results of expression data with high noise
levels.

The best known approach to incorporating biological knowledge
is to measure the semantic distance between known genes in Gene
Ontology (Azuaje and Bodenreider, 2004; Lord and Stevens, 2003;
Sevilla et al., 2005). This GO-based distance between two genes is
incorporated into the expression-based distance during the process

of clustering (Cheng et al., 2004; Fang et (11., 2006; Huang and
Pan, 2006; Kustra and Zagdanski, 2006). Information content theory
has been widely used to measure a semantic distance between
genes in GO.

Despite the importance of utilizing the semantic distance into
cluster analysis, few freely available application programs can
perform clustering using the ontology-based semantic distances
as prior biological knowledge. We have developed a software
program, SICAGO, a tool for SemI-supervised Cluster Analysis
using semantic distance between gene pairs in Gene Ontology to
satisfy these needs. SICAGO supports (i) three well-known semantic
distance measures based on information content. Thus, we can see
which type of semantic distance is most effective to construct prior
knowledge using GO. It also supports (ii) three Gene Ontologies,
so that we can analyze how the difference of semantic distance
between two genes, according to GO structures, inﬂuences clustering
performance. Finally, it supports (iii) the most widely used k-means
clustering algorithm, so that we can analyze the effectiveness of
semi-supervised clustering when prior knowledge was incorporated.

2 SICAGO OVERVIEW

Figure 1 shows the schematic diagram of SICAGO software. It
performs three tasks: semantic calculation, semantic correlation and
cluster analysis. A system interface lets users to upload an input
ﬁle, and then select the type of task in order. The source is freely
available and modiﬁed under GNU GPL.

Task I of SICAGO, semantic calculation, provides the semantic
distances between gene pairs in GO. Three well-known semantic
distance measures (Jiang and David, 1997; Lin, 1998; Resnik,
1995) are supported to achieve this. These measures are based on
information content theory, where the semantic similarity between
genes is determined by the amount of information they share in
common. This shared information is computed using the set of
parent nodes (genes); the more parents two genes share, the more
similar they are. The ontology selection in SICAGO provides
three domains of GO; biological process (BP) that indicates the
operations of molecular events with a deﬁned beginning and end;
cellular component (CC) that indicates the parts of a cell or
its extracellular environment; and molecular ﬁinction (MF) that
indicates the elemental activities of a gene product at the molecular
level. After users select the type of semantic measure and type of
ontology, SICAGO calculates all the semantic distances between
genes in the ontology.

Task II, semantic correlation, provides the semantic distance
results between two genes obtained from Task I. SICAGO shows
the comparative results for the two genes picked by users using
three distance measures: expression-based Euclidean distance, GO-
based semantic distance and correlation coefﬁcient. Users can see the
difference between expression and ontology-based distance results.
We showed the distance between two genes in the ontology using a
tree view to understand the semantic distance better.

Task III, cluster analysis, provides the semi-supervised k-means
clustering algorithm. We amended the distance between a gene and
a group calculation method to exploit the prior knowledge generated
from the selected ontology and semantic distance. We modiﬁed the
distance measure (dist) between a gene (g) and a group (G) to be a
linear combination of their expression-based Euclidean/correlation
distance and their semantic distance to select a cluster where a gene
is assigned. Thus, dist(g, G) is deﬁned by:

dist(g.G>=a xE(g.G)+(1—a> xS(g.G> (1)
where
E(g.G>= iIg—center(G>ii2 (2)
is an expression-based Euclidean distance,

is an ontology-based semantic distance. 11 is the number of genes
that have semantic distances to g, and M is the maximum value
of the semantic distances between g and other genes. The weight
coefﬁcient 0 fat 3 1 controls the weights of the two distances.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We validated the presented system on three well-known yeast and
human gene datasets (Cho et al., 1998; Eisen et al., 1998; Spellman,
1998; Whitﬁeld et al., 2002). From the series of experimental results,
we could see that the performance of the presented semi-supervised
clustering method was surprisingly increased compared with that of
the only expression-based clustering:

0 The composition of the Euclidean distance with Lin/Resnik’s
measures showed the best performance in k-means clustering.

0 The best all values in Equation (1) are 0l=0.l and 0.3 for
Jiang’s measure incorporated; 0t :03 and 0.5 for Lin/Resnik’s
measures.

0 The cluster obtained by SICAGO shows a high enrichment of
GO ﬁlnctional categories for predicting the ﬁinction of a gene.

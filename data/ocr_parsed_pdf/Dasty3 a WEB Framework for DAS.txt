ABSTRACT

Motivation: Dasty3 is a highly interactive and extensible Web-
based framework. It provides a rich Application Programming
Interface upon which it is possible to develop specialized clients
capable of retrieving information from DAS sources as well as
from data providers not using the DAS protocol. Dasty3 provides
significant improvements on previous Web-based frameworks and is
implemented using the 1.6 DAS specification.

Availability: Dasty3 is an open-source tool freely available at
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/dasty/ under the terms of the GNU General
public license. Source and documentation can be found at
http://code.google.com/p/dasty/.

1 INTRODUCTION

The Distributed Annotation System (DAS) deﬁnes a communication
protocol used to exchange annotations on genomic or protein
sequences (Jenkinson et (11., 2008). Implicit in the conception of
DAS is the notion of decentralization; annotations should not be
provided by single centralized databases, but should instead be
spread over multiple sites. DAS relies on client—server architecture;
DAS servers manage data distribution by following a stande
protocol, while manipulation and visualization are on the client
side —thus facilitating the development of tailored tools addressing
speciﬁc requirements. Several clients are available; for instance,
SPICE (Prlic et al., 2005) is a browser that displays protein
sequences, structures and their corresponding annotations. Another
client, Dasty2, provides a Web-based interface that facilitates
visualizing and comparing protein sequence annotations from DAS
servers (Jimenez et al., 2008). These clients are addressing speciﬁc
needs; however, none of them is providing a framework upon which
tools can be built and integrated into a cohesive web environment.

2 RESULTS

Dasty3 relies on a modular architecture, which facilitates
development of specialized plug-ins. Dasty3 like Dasty2 is a
web-based DAS client. However, Dasty3 is not just a client, but

a platform delivering a rich API over which tailored plug-ins
can be built. Dasty3 inherits from Dasty2 the modularity of its
Graphical User Interface (GUI). Additionally, it provides a Web-
based framework for visualizing and manipulating information from
DAS sources as well as other third-party data providers. It facilitates
delivering uniﬁed views upon which several manipulation facilities
can be implemented. It offers a public Application Programming
Interface (API) that delivers methods for integrating, visualizing
and manipulating data sources.

2.1 User experience

As illustrated in Figure l, Dasty3 preserves the look and feel
of Dasty2; in this way, the learning curve is minimized. Dasty3
enhances some of the previous functionalities available in Dasty2
and adds new ones. For instance, the search plug-in allows users to
deﬁne the sources against which the query should be executed.
Dasty3 uses PICR (Cote et al., 2007) for matching the query string
to the corresponding UniProt accession or identiﬁer; the connection
to the UniProt DAS reference server (Jones et al., 2005) is then
established and the sequence retrieved. Finally, it queries all the
selected sources and merges the retrieved sequence annotations. The
set of predeﬁned plug-ins provides the user with a uniﬁed, organized
and interactive view of the available data. A query retrieving
information for protein P03973 (antileukoproteinase) is illustrated

in Figure l. The 3D view of the protein structure, supported by Jmol
(http://jmol.sourceforge.net), is displayed on the right-hand side
while the features, organized in tracks, are presented at the bottom.
The pop-up window presents a detailed view of the annotation that
is highlighted on the sequence.

New data sources can be manually added including the URL of a
valid DAS source. DAS sources can also be selected from a list of
sources provided by the DAS registry. The ﬁltering plug-in toggles
the display of protein annotations. New ﬁlters based on DAS-related
ontologies, such as those available from the Ontology Look-up
service (Cote et al., 2008), have been included to consistently
ﬁlter annotations from different sources. A new interaction plug-
in retrieves a summary for molecular interaction data. We are using
the DAS Writeback (Salazar et al., 2011) to support community
annotation. The DAS Writeback is an extension to the DAS
protocol. It allows adding, editing and deleting annotations. These
ﬁinctionalities have been implemented in Dasty3 over the DAS
Writeback plug-in. Dasty3 also makes it possible to save snapshots
of user’s sessions in the form of a JSON ﬁle. For instance, users may
search, select and highlight a feature in the sequence; then, they
can generate the corresponding snapshot of the session for future
analysis or for sharing it with collaborators.

2.2 Architecture

Dasty3 is based on a plug-in architecture. It emphasizes extensibility,
plug-in customization and interoperability e.g. data exchange
among plug-ins. For instance, information is exchanged between
the sequence and the 3D structure plug-in; as amino acids are
selected, these are highlighted in the 3D structure. The architecture
makes it possible for plug-ins to listen events from other plug-ins.
Furthermore, the architecture also makes it easy for developers
to integrate Dasty3 into existing Web applications as well as to
conﬁgure the look-and-feel by deﬁning customized templates.

As illustrated in Figure 2, Dasty3 brings together several
components that can be accessed by using the API. jsDAS
(http://code.google.com/p/j sdas/) is being used as a bridge between
the framework and DAS servers; it automatically generates
JavaScript objects representing, in concordance with the DAS 1.6
speciﬁcation, the DAS responses. The framework has ﬁve major

components, namely: (i) the Model, deﬁning the DAS objects
according to the DAS 1.6 speciﬁcation (http://www.biodas.org);
(ii) the Controller, managing the retrieval, organization and storage
of the data; (iii) the Plug-in Manager, making it possible to load plug-
ins; (iv) the Event Manager, managing and triggering events so that
plug-ins can communicate with each other; and, (v) the Template
Manager, rendering the plug-ins in the available area according
to the selected template. Plug-ins are components that extend the
capabilities of the framework by delivering a particular functionality.
They are deﬁned as a tightly coupled collection of JavaScript and
CSS ﬁles. Templates add ﬂexibility to the Graphical User Interface
(GUI) by simplifying the display of plug-ins and customization
of the layout. For instance, moving and reorganizing plug-ins
according to end user preferences can be deﬁned in a template.
The modularization upon which Dasty3 relies facilitates sharing; in
the same way, as developers share modules and themes in Content
Management Systems (CMSs) such as Drupal (http://drupal.org) and
J oomla (http://www.joomla.org), they are able to share templates and
plug-ins in Dasty3.

3 FINAL REMARKS

Dasty3 is the ﬁrst DAS client fully compliant with the 1.6. DAS
speciﬁcation. It has been tested on Internet Explorer, Firefox,
Chrome and Safari. Dasty3 is highly modular and extensible,
and new components can be easily added to the framework. The
interoperability delivered by the API facilitates the ﬂow of data
across plug-ins. The architecture also facilitates the organization of
the front-end by means of templates; easing in this way the deﬁnition
of the layout and improving the user experience. Dasty3 separates
the functional components, being managed by the Plug-in manager,
from those related to the user experience and graphical layout, being
managed by the Template manager. This separation makes it easier
for developers to deliver richer applications built over the Dasty3
framework; in the same way, end users receive more personalized
task-oriented tools. In addition, Dasty3 facilitates mechanisms for
integrating resources beyond the DAS ecosystem; by doing so, the
retrieved information presents a broader view to the end user.

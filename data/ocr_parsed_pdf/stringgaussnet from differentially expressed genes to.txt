Abstract

Motivation: Knowledge—based and co—expression networks are two kinds of gene networks that
can be currently implemented by sophisticated but distinct tools. We developed stringgaussnet, an
R package that integrates both approaches, starting from a list of differentially expressed genes.

1 Introduction

Analysis of genes differentially expressed (DE) depending on a con-
dition has become a standard procedure in current biology.
However, identification of biologically relevant DE genes is far from
being trivial. Yet efficient prioritization of DE genes is an essential
step before undertaking rate-limiting wet lab experiments (Smyth,
2004). In this regard, the network theory appears as a powerful
framework. The aim is to connect genes (the nodes) by means of
their interactions, the edges (Dong and Horvath, 2007). These inter-
actions may be based on prior knowledge, curated and stored in
databases, or extracted from the experimental dataset, e.g. using
coexpression information (Cotney et (11., 2015; Lin et (11., 2015;
Verfaillie et 111., 2015; Xue et (11., 2014). Sophisticated but distinct
tools are available to implement either one of these approaches sep-
arately. We introduce stringgaussnet, an R package that allows
inferring gene networks starting from a list of DE genes by integrat-
ing both of these approaches with ease and flexibility.

2 Initial objects and example data

Stringgaussnet requires two data frames that store, one the expression
measurements, the other DE gene statistics. They are combined to cre-
ate an object of class DEGeneExpr. Expression data are usually nor-
malized for efficient correlation computation. In the example data,
we provided transcriptomic profiles of monocyte-derived dendritic

cells from nine patients affected with ankylosing spondylitis and 10
healthy controls. Transcriptomic data were obtained using micro-
arrays. Gene expression levels in patients and in controls were then
compared with LIMMA (Talpin et (11., 2014). We limited the number
of DE genes to 75.

3 String network construction

Stringgaussnet allows constructing a protein—protein interaction net-
work using the DE gene names (Ensenibl IDs or HGNC symbols) with
the use of the STRING API with specific URIs (Franceschini et (11.,
2013; Szklarczyk et (11., 2015). The number of additional nodes can be
set by the user, and these are useful to detect indirect relationships be-
tween input genes. The default value is twice the number of initial DE
genes. Different species can be curated, the default being Homo sapi-
6115. This process generates an object of class STRINGNet, a network
with multiple edges depending on sources and combined scores. One
can select specific sources of interactions and filter on the scores given
by STRING. Stringgaussnet can calculate a new combined score, based
on the algorithm provided for STRING version 8 (http://string-stitch.
blogspot.fr/20 l 0/03/con1bining-scores-right-way.htnil).

4 Short paths from string networks

The generated network can be large and dense. As a STRINGNet
object, it can be reduced by computing shortest paths between genes

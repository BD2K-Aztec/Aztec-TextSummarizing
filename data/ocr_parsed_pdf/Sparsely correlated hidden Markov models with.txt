states in each series, one can formulate N separate HMMs by
assuming independence between every pair of series, as illustrated
in Figure la (referred to as iHMM hereafter). Alternatively, one
can formulate a single HMM with 2N hidden states (Fig. lb,
referred to as fullHMM), where 2N is the number of hidden
states when there are two states in each series. They represent
two opposite extremes in the sense that iHMM completely ignores
the correlation between series, whereas fullHMM incorporates
the correlation in the multivariate model for the hidden states.
Both approaches have advantages and shortcomings: iHMM may
feature low statistical power, but it is computationally efﬁcient. In
contrast, fullHMM embodies the correlation directly; however,
not all hidden state combinations necessarily appear in the data
and it is computationally expensive, if not intractable. Practically,
however, estimation of an HMM with 2N hidden states is com—
putationally intractable when N is large because 4N possible tran—
sitions need to be followed.

Here we present a novel statistical model that represents a com—
promise of these two, termed sparsely correlated HMM
(scHMM). The scHMM approach captures a small subset of
non—ignorable correlations among data series to avoid modeling
all pairwise correlations. This sparsity property is achieved by
adopting a regularization regression strategy. Figure 10 illustrates
our proposed method. The dashed—line arrows connecting the
hidden states between series indicate the signiﬁcant correlations
captured by scHMM. For example, the hidden states at windows
t— l and t in the first series, but not the third, are used to estimate
the transition probability between windows t—l and t in the
second series, and vice versa. Under this framework, there is no
need to consider combinations of hidden states across all series (as
N—tuples) as in fullHMM, and hidden states can be inferred con—
sidering just four types of transitions in each series separately
(solid lines). The scHMM algorithm is able to take advantage
of the interactions between correlated series to improve the infer—
ence of hidden states. Moreover, we also reduce the computa—
tional cost by iterating through N series and inferring the
hidden state vectors one series a time, conditioning on the current
hidden state vector estimates of all other series.

Note that the goal of scHMM is different from that of
the multivariate HMM method developed by Ernst and Kellis

(2010) for the analysis of combinatorial patterns of histone
modiﬁcation using ChIP—seq data. scHMM aims to infer the
hidden states in the multiple chains simultaneously, whereas
the multivariate HMM attempts to identify a small subset of
representative combinatorial patterns and annotate the genome
with respect to such patterns. Nevertheless, the ChIP—enriched
windows identiﬁed by scHMM can be used to facilitate the
multivariate HMM analysis, potentially improving the quality
of genomic annotation.

2 METHODS

2.1 Overview

Suppose that data have been collected from multiple genome—
wide experiments that are related to each other, for example,
DNA—binding proteins that are part of a protein complex, or
the same DNA—binding proteins profiled under different treat—
ment conditions or different cell lines. Each experiment yields a
data series measured across the genome. Assume that there are
N series, denoted by O = {0),} for t: l, ..., T and
j = l, ..., N, where 0N denotes the observed datum (emission)
at window I. The observed data 0 are associated with binary
hidden states H = {hi/4‘ ,} indicating the status of either true bind—
ing site (state 1) or background site (state 0). We also use 0,
and h, to denote the observed data and hidden states, respect—
ively, at window I across all series. The goal of HMM analysis
is the estimation of H.

As mentioned above, iHMM is a straightforward approach
where each series j has an independent HMM with the two
states. Standard HMM for a single data series has three compo—
nents: (i) the probability mass function of the first window
71(hjo = 1); (ii) the transition kernel K],

which is constant for all windows {I : 0 g t g T}; and (iii) the
emission n(O/,|hj, = 0) and n(O/,|h,«, = 1) for all t. The likelihood
of this model can be written as

Given the three components, the forwardibackward algorithm
can be applied to infer the hidden states quickly (Rabiner, 1989).
Although iHMM is fast and straightforward, it is unable to
capture the correlation between related data series. This correl—
ation can be explicitly incorporated in the model to increase
statistical power and remove noise. The most intuitive approach
is fullHMM, a single HMM with 2N hidden state combinations
and 2N >< 2N transition kernel K. The likelihood of fullHMM is

Here we assume that the emission is independent of the hidden
states in other series, i.e. 71(O,,|h,)= n(O/,|hj,) for all j and t.
Similar to iHMM, the forwardibackward algorithm can be
applied to infer the hidden states as well.

2.2 Sparsely correlated hidden Markov models

Although fullHMM accounts for the Markovian dynamics
between hidden state combinations, not all combinations
necessarily occur in the data and, more importantly, the order of
computation for the forwardibackward algorithm is 0(T - 4N) as
opposed to 0(N - 4T) in iHMM. This clearly limits the applicabil—
ity of f ullHMM to cases with small or moderate N. When the goal
of analysis is inference of hidden states in each series, fullHMM
will be computationally inefficient. This motivated us to develop
scHMM, a compromise between the two methods.

In the scHMM algorithm, we allow different series to be
correlated as in fullHMM. At the same time, we apply two
strategies, which reduce the computational cost to a level similar
to that of iHMM. First, instead of considering all series
simultaneously, we iteratively infer parameters by cycling through
each series individually. For each individual series, inference is
performed conditioning on the current hidden state vectors in
all other series. Second, in each series, we assume sparsity when
incorporating correlations between the current series and all other
series. The correlation imposed is of the form of an inhomogen—
eous transition kernel. To be speciﬁc, we denote the transition
kernel of scHMM for series j at window I by

_ 1—R/‘2 P}:
Ian—(“(11, q], ,

which has an additional index (I) because the transition prob—
ability varies by window I. Here, we define pi, and q,, to incorp—
orate the input from other series as follows:

P}: = Trail/,2 = 1 I Ill/1:71 = 0’ {(hk,tilahk,t)}k7éj)
(11;: 7701/1121 III/1:71 =1,{(hk,til,hk,t)}k#)-

That is, the transition probability in series j is adjusted by the
hidden states in other series {I : 1 75 j}. Here we consider two 10—
gistic regression models in each data series:

10g  Z 5% + Z  H +  ,) (2)

_ 16%]

 

log 3”. =%+Z(aoihktzil+mhk.z) <3)
1 q” 16%]

where Equations (2) and (3) hold on windows {I : ,,1<0.5}
and {t : ,4 3 0.5}, respectively. In the equations, the super—
scripts ]; and c indicate ‘previous’ and ‘current’ windows, respect—
ively. In this setup, each regression coefﬁcient carries a
straightforward interpretation. For example, the intercept term
ﬂfo is the baseline log odds for 0 —> 1 transition in series j when
all other correlated series are in the background state (state 0) at
windows t— 1 and t.  and ﬂfk are the increase in the log odds
of 0 —> 1 transition in series j when previous and current win—
dows are in binding/modiﬁcation state (state 1) in series k (k 75 j),
respectively.

In the current form, however, the number of regression coef—
ﬁcients will keep growing as more series are incorporated in the
analysis. To address this concern, we impose a sparsity constraint
using a LASSO penalty (Tibshirani, 1996) such that

[Gram/w) s» and Z(Ia¢§,l+|yfll) sp

16$]

The details of the estimation procedure, including the coordinate
descent algorithm by Friedman et a]. (2010), are provided in the
Supplementary Information.

Lastly, because our major application of interest is read count
data from ChIP—seq experiments, we used a ﬂexible class of dis—
tributions for emission, including zero—inﬂated mixture model for
the background sites (state 0) and generalized Poisson distribution
for the binding/modiﬁcation sites (state 1). These distributions
were previously used in the HPeak software (Qin et al., 2010).

We remark that the computational time of scHMM is signifi—
cantly less than that of fullHMM. To see this, note that there are
two elements in the total computation time of scHMM: one for
inferring hidden states and the other for learning the regression
coefﬁcients. For the former, the complexity is no more than
0(N - (4d)T), where a is the additional time to compute the
odds using (2N — 1) hidden state predictors at each transition,
which should be trivial unless N is very large (a should be close
to 1). For the latter, the computational complexity is the time it
takes to fit 2N logistic regression models with LASSO penalty in
datasets with (2N — 1) covariates and T data points, and thus
this can be time—consuming in large datasets (large T) like
genome—wide ChIP—seq data, and thus we randomly sample gen—
omic regions of a sufﬁcient size (as shown in section 4.1) and fit
the model using the subset to save time. Therefore, the compu—
tation should be much more efﬁcient than fullHMM.

3 SIMULATION STUDIES

To evaluate the performance of scHMM, we conducted simula—
tion studies. Because typical quantitative data reported from

 

535

sequencing experiments are read counts, we used Poisson distri—
butions to generate the count data with varying signal—to—noise
ratios. scHMM is applicable to a wide range of scenarios, but
we considered the representative cases where scHMM is
deemed beneﬁcial. Three different models are compared side
by side: iHMMs, scHMMs and fullHMM, and the performance
was evaluated in terms of receiver—operating characteristic
(ROC) curves (Supplementary Figs S1 and S2). Datasets were
generated 10 times owing to computational time constraints in
fullHMM in each simulation, and ROC curves were averaged
over them.

3.1 Independent experiments

We ﬁrst simulated three data series where there was no system—
atic correlation between series. This simulation was conducted to
assess whether scHMM picks up false positives, in which case
scHMM should underperform iHMM. On a dataset with 10000
windows in 3 series, we planted mound—shaped signals (state 1),
of average length 5 consecutive windows, at random positions in
all series, and regarded all other windows to be in the back—
ground state (state 0). The read counts in the background state
were generated from Poisson distribution with mean 5, whereas
the read counts in the real binding state were generated from
Poisson distribution with mean 7.5, 10 and 15. Figure 2a
shows that, as expected, all three HMMs yield nearly identical

ROC curves in the case of 2—fold data (Poisson mean 10 for

well (data not shown).

3.2 Replicated ChIP experiments

We then considered the scenario of replicate experiments. We
assumed that ChIP experiments for a transcription factor were
repeated three times, each giving one data series. We planted
signals of average length 10 windows centered at every 50th
window (with 75% chance at each position), and regarded all
other windows to be in the background state. Read counts were
generated the same way as described above (1.5—, 2— and 3 fold).
In all cases, because the mounds were planted in shared binding
sites across replicates, hidden states were expected to be highly
correlated between all three series. Indeed, the between—series
coefﬁcients {ﬂ} and {y} were mostly positive, indicating an in—
crease in the log odds of the 0 —> 1 and 1 —> 1 transitions when
other series are in binding states in the past and current positions.
The ROC curves in Figure 2b clearly demonstrate that scHMM
improved the sensitivity and specificity over iHMM, but not as
good as fullHMM.

3.3 Groups of experiments with shared binding sites

Next we considered a more realistic scenario with six ChIP ex—
periments. We used the same emission distributions (Poisson) for

generating the simulation data as above. Here we assumed two
and three groups of correlated experiments. In the two—group
case, the windows containing signals were shared across the
series within each group, but not between the groups. In the
three—group case (each with two series), windows containing sig—
nals were mutually exclusive between the ﬁrst two groups, but
both groups shared such windows with the third group. As ex—
pected, the regression coefﬁcients for the 0 —> 1 transition were
positive within each group in both two— and three—group cases,
but they were zero for the between—groups coefﬁcients. For the
three—group case, there were additional positive coefﬁcients be—
tween the first and third groups and between the second and
third groups, in accordance with the data generation mechanism.
In both examples, the ROC curve for scHMM showed improved
sensitivity over iHMM at all points, at times almost identical to
that of fullHMM (Fig. 2c and (1). Interestingly, fullHMM some—
times showed slightly poorer speciﬁcity compared with scHMM
in some simulations because fullHMM picked up too many sig—
nals from the background regions. Moreover, even in this
mini—scale data, the computational time for fullHMM was 107
15minutes, whereas scHMM took <10 seconds, indicating a sig—
niﬁcant improvement in computational efﬁciency for achieving a
similar ROC proﬁle.

4 ANALYSIS OF HISTONE MODIFICATIONS IN
HUMAN CD4+ T CELLS

In eukaryotic organisms, DNA is packaged into a chromatin
structure by wrapping DNA around histones. It has been dis—
covered that the cellular state is closely related to the modiﬁcation
patterns of the histone, or chromatin state (Bernstein et al., 2007;
Kouzarides, 2007). For this reason, it is of great interest in biology
to construct a genome—wide map of chromatin states in different
cell types. An increasing number of studies have reported
genome—wide data for multiple histone modiﬁcations using
ChIP—chip (Kim et al., 2005) or ChIP—seq (Mikkelsen et al.,
2007). Because multiple histone modification marks are involved
in transcriptional regulation and many of them are closely related,
it is highly desirable to analyze these datasets jointly; scHMM is
an ideal method for such analysis. In this study, we applied
scHMM to a large—scale ChIP—seq dataset, which surveyed 39
histone acetylations and methylations in the human genome, in
addition to RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) and insulator bind—
ing protein CTCF (Barski et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2008).

4.1 Data processing and model ﬁtting

We downloaded the raw sequence read data from the SRA data—
base (~243 million reads) and performed preprocessing of data,
including alignment against the most recent release of the human
genome (hg19) using the bowtie software (Langmead et al.,
2009). Then we extracted read count data in 15.4 million
200 bp windows (contiguous non—overlapping). See Supplemen—
tary Information for details. Using the processed data, we ﬁt
iHMM and scHMM for each chromosome separately.
fullHMM did not finish a single iteration in 2 days for any of
the 24 chromosomes. In contrast, it took ~20 minutes to ﬁt
scHMM for each chromosome; thus, fullHMM was excluded
for further analysis. For scHMM, ﬁtting a penalized regression

for the entire data (millions of windows in 41 data series) is
computationally demanding, and hence we randomly sampled
100 blocks of 500 windows (each ranging 10kb) from each
chromosome and used them to train the regression coefﬁcients,
which were later used to estimate the posterior probability (pp) of
enrichment across the whole chromosome. As expected, the re—
gression coefﬁcients were similar across chromosomes. Overall,
both iHMM and scHMM reported a various number of
ChIP—enriched windows with pp 3 0.9. In both analyses, the
six histone methylations H2BK5me1, H3K4me1, H3K4me3,
H3K9me1, H3K36me3 and H4K20me1 were the most abundant
modiﬁcations across the genome, followed by various acetyl—
ations of H3 and H4, RNA Pol II and CTCF, for which pp
was above 0.9 in more than 40 000 windows. In total, scHMM
reported fewer ChIP—enriched windows than iHMM (see
Supplementary Table S1).

To see whether scHMM effectively incorporated the correl—
ation, we computed two correlation matrices of the histone
modiﬁcations using the estimated probabilities (pp) reported by
scHMM and iHMM, respectively, and performed agglomerative
hierarchical clustering on each correlation matrix. Both correl—
ation matrices showed a large acetylation block mainly consist—
ing of acetylation marks, suggesting that histone acetylations are
more concerted than histone methylations across the genome.
Both blocks contain the 17—member ‘modification backbone’
described in the original study by Wang et a]. (2008). By close
inspection, we found that the acetylation block generated from
scHMM contained 26 marks, four more than that generated
from iHMM. The four additional marks are all acetylation
marks: H4K12ac, H4K16ac, H2AK9ac and H2AK5ac. The in—
clusion of these four marks is supported by observing the histone
acetylation patterns in the transcription start site (TSS) region
and across the gene bodies of 1000 highly active or silent genes
reported in Wang et al. (2008). Moreover, the scHMM output
showed increased correlation among closely related modifica—
tions over the iHMM output across the data. For example, in
the large group of 26 modiﬁcations clustered together by
scHMM (Fig. 3b), 299 pairs showed increased correlation and
26 pairs showed decreased correlation in scHMM compared with
iHMM.

4.2 Histone modiﬁcations in actively transcribed genes

For real datasets, we cannot directly evaluate the sensitivity and
speciﬁcity of the two HMM algorithms. Instead, we examined
the modiﬁcation patterns of well—characterized histone modifica—
tions. We learned from Wang et al. (2008) that 17 modiﬁcations
in the backbone module tend to co—localize at gene promoters,
and genes associated with these modiﬁcations tend to have
higher expression. In particular, Koch et al. (2007) also found
from the ENCODE data (The ENCODE Project Consortium,
2004) that H3K4me3, a member of the backbone module, accu—
mulates in the promoter region of actively transcribed genes. In
contrast, Bannister et a]. (2005) observed that another key modi—
ﬁcation H3K36me3 peaks toward the 3’ end of actively tran—
scribed genes. By examining whether the similar pattern holds
in our genome—wide data, we can indirectly assess the sensitivity
and speciﬁcity of the two methods. To this end, we ﬁrst obtained
the gene expression proﬁle of the same human CD4+ T cells

windows from intergenic region to repressive and repetitive states
(states 4&51). Table 1 reports the number of matching EK states
in each region—speciﬁc group for iHMM and scHMM, as well as
the difference (scHMM — iHMM). The mapping results not lim—
ited to region—speciﬁc states can be found in Supplementary
Table S4. In all regions except for the repressed states, more
combinatorial patterns from scHMM output (444%) could be
mapped to EK states than those from iHMM output (see
‘unmappable’ windows). In the promoter region, fewer patterns
from scHMM were mapped to promoter upstream states (173),
but more were mapped to transcribed or repressed promoter
states (#11). This is consistent with the fact that we mapped
the windows 500 bp upstream and downstream of TSS. In the
transcribed region, more windows from scHMM were mapped
to transcribed states in the 5’ proximal end (12719), transcription
end sites (27) and zinc finger (ZNF) genes (28), whereas fewer
windows from scHMM were mapped to spliced exon and 5’
distal states. In the 5’ proximal region, more windows from
scHMM were mapped to distal enhancer/active intergenic
states (3L36), rather than non—repressive intergenic states.
Lastly, a large number of additional windows from iHMM
were mapped to ‘unmappable states’ where all modiﬁcations

are depleted in EK model. These windows were mapped to het—
erochromatin states (41414), simple repression (45) and repetitive
states (47751) in scHMM instead. Based on these results, we
conclude that the regions identified by scHMM yield more in—
terpretable combinatorial patterns as reported in the previous
landmark study, thereby supporting the hypothesis that
scHMM selects high—conﬁdence regions with less noise than
iHMM.

4.4 Histone modiﬁcations in intergenic regions

Because we have performed a genome—wide analysis, we can fur—
ther use the output to characterize the chromatin states in the
intergenic region. Here we brieﬂy describe the landscape of chro—
matin states in the intergenic region. We deﬁne ‘intergenic’ as the
genomic region between every pair of adjacent transcripts in the
Ensembl database (32 539), excluding 2kb regions around TSS
and TES of each transcript to clearly distinguish the patterns in
and out of the genes. Supplementary Figure S4 shows the distinct
spatial distribution of histone modifications between intragenic
and intergenic regions. First, most acetylations and five
most frequent methylations associated with active transcription
(e.g. H4K20me1, H3K36me3, H3K9me1, H3K4me1 and

H2BK5me1) appeared in the intragenic regions at least twice as
much as in the intergenic regions. In contrast, the methylations
associated with transcription repression (H3K27me2,
H3K27me3, H3K9me2, H3K9me3) appeared more frequently
in the intergenic regions compared with the intragenic regions.
Moreover, a few modifications associated with actively tran—
scribed genes dominated the intragenic region, whereas various
modiﬁcations appeared as frequently as each other, indicating
the chromatin states might be either complex or sporadic in the
intergenic region than the intragenic region. This result is also
reﬂected in the distinct correlation patterns in the two regions
(Supplementary Figure S5). In the intragenic region, the modiﬁ—
cation backbone and the methylations associated with actively
transcribed genes (e.g. methylations of H3K4 and H3K9me1)
formed a tight cluster, and the remaining histone modiﬁcations
were not well correlated. In contrast, the methylations associated
with repressive genes (e.g. H3K9me3, H3K27me3, H4K20me3)
formed a strong cluster in the intergenic region.

5 CONCLUSION

In this work, we presented a computationally efficient method
termed scHMM for inferring hidden states in correlated HMMs
with sparsity constraints. We used an expectation—maximization
—type procedure to infer the hidden states and other model par—
ameters. The advantage of scHMM is that it takes the
inter—sample correlations into account in the hidden state infer—
ence, and thus is more efﬁcient and powerful than iHMM when
the data series are related. This situation arises frequently in
epigenetic studies because many of the acetylation and methyla—
tion marks are part of a large complex. Although there is no
guarantee that the iterative procedure will converge eventually,
our experience with both simulated data and real data suggests
that scHMM works well in all cases we have tested.

As in many other complex problems, finding the exact global
maximum(a) in the likelihood function is neither possible nor
necessary. Nevertheless, it is possible to develop efﬁcient algo—
rithms that can achieve close—to—optimal results within a reason—
able amount of time. Our study gives such an example. By
applying scHMM, we can make interesting and insightful biolo—
gical ﬁndings even though our algorithm cannot be guaranteed
to ﬁnd the exact optimal solution across all possible hidden
paths.

Our method is related to the factorial HMM (Ghahramani
and Jordan, 1997) in the literature, but the two methods are
different in the sense that factorial HMM incorporates the
inter—series correlation by marginalizing hidden state model for
each series with homogeneous transition probabilities and using
multivariate emission, whereas scHMM achieves the same goal
using the same model for hidden states but with conditionally
independent emission and inhomogeneous transition probabil—
ities. In genome—wide location studies, it is not intuitive to
assume that the observed data, e. g. read count data, themselves
are correlated given their hidden states, and it is difficult to ﬁnd a
standard probability distribution to represent such correlation.
Therefore, we believe that scHMM is better suited for this type
of applications.

We demonstrated the utility of scHMM for improved
genome—wide mapping of histone modiﬁcation sites. In this

application, the goal of scHMM is to identify the regions of
ChIP enrichment in multiple ChIP—seq dataset simultaneously.
Typically, genome—wide binding patterns are inferred individu—
ally without considering the correlation between the data series.
In this work, we showed that scHMM establishes a statistically
principled framework to deliver this goal by borrowing statistical
strength from related factors to improve the power of site
detection.

In closing, we remark that scHMM offers great ﬂexibility for
extensions. For example, the method can be immediately
extended to higher—order HMMs by adding more covariates
(adjacent loci) in the penalized logistic regression model. It is
apparently impossible to ﬁt such models in a multivariate form
in genome—wide datasets owing to rapidly rising complexity.
Furthermore, additional covariates can be easily added to the
regression model for the purpose of incorporating previous
knowledge of signal patterns such as known binding sites from
the genomic annotation database. However, such extensions are
beyond the scope of this work and we leave them for future
work.

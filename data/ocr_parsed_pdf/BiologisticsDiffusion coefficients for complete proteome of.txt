3.3 Other models of diffusion in the cytoplasm

We compared our results with three models of diffusion in the
cytoplasm of E. coli, available in the literature (Figures 3 and 4).
McGuffee and Elcock (2010) proposed two models of diffusion
in the cytoplasm: the ‘steric’ model, which takes into account
only steric interactions between diffusing proteins, and the
‘full’ model, which includes steric, electrostatic and hydro—
dynamic interactions between diffusing entities. Comparison of
the results (Figure 3) shows that the model we propose takes into
account possible interactions between the diffusing probes and
the surrounding environment. Moreover, we show that the full
information needed to build the stRC can be obtained only
after taking into account the probes whose rp greatly exceeds Rh.
For example, simulations conducted by McGuffee and Elcock
(2010) include proteins that are most abundant in the cytoplasm,
but the absence of large objects such as the nucleoid leads to
underestimated values of Do/Dcyw. The effect starts to be mean—
ingful for probes whose rp> 10 nm. In that case, the values of
Do/Dcy‘0 are lower by an order of magnitude with respect to
experimental results.

We also compared our results with the model proposed by
Mika and Poolman (2011), where Dcyw or Mv’vm. As can be

seen, the power law dependence of Dcyw on MW may also lead
to underestimated values of Do/Dcyw. For example, for the ribo—
some 70S Do/Dm0 measured experimentally is five times higher
than predicted using power law dependence. Therefore, the
power law dependence proposed by Mika and Poolman (2011)
holds for the proteins in a small range of molecular weights
20730 kDa and, moreover, is not applicable to macromolecules
other than proteins. This is because each type of macromolecules
(DNA, RNA, proteins, polymers, etc.), has different shape and
thus different dependence of rp on MW [Equations (1}(5)]. The
shape of the macromolecule and in consequence its radius trans—
lates into the DC. The dependence of DC Boy“) of different types
of macromolecules (proteins, RNA and DNA) on their molecu—
lar weight is shown in Figure 4.

3.4 Accuracy of the model

Accuracy in determination of the stRC strongly depends on
the amount of available data. One would expect that increasing
the amount of data for probes of rp >> Rh and rp<§, would
significantly decrease the maximum error of the stRC (com—
pare Fig. 2).

The first step towards biologistics

 

plasmid whose molecular weight equals to 10 000 kDa, the DC of
the plasmid is of the order of Dplasm = 10’4 “1112/8. Suppose
further that the protein spends one—tenth of the time diffusing
freely If, and the remaining 90% of time To as a complex with the
plasmid (IC 2 10m). The effective DCs of the complexes Deff,
defined as Deff = (Dcyj0 + DC‘L’C/ If) / (1 + TC/Tf), and under as—
sumption that DC 2 Dplasm, will be nearly an order of magnitude
lower than the predicted one (Dcym):Deff = 0.8 pm2 / s. According
to the above analysis, we can assume that any deviation of ex—
perimentally measured DC from the proposed stRC will result
from intermolecular interactions such as speciﬁc or non—speciﬁc
binding.

3.7 Diffusion in the cytoplasm and the diffusion in
organelles of eukaryotes

Prokaryotic cells are characterized by small sizes [volume of E.
coli is approximately V ~ 0.6/tm3 (Kubitschek, 1990)].
Measurements of diffusion in the cytoplasm of these cells are
performed for the entire volume of the cytoplasm. Thereby, the
effective DC measured in these experiments is the value averaged
over the entire volume of the cytoplasm. Because the stRC was
found on the basis of DCs, in the case of E. coli, this curve is also
averaged over the entire volume of the cell. At this point, it
should be stressed that the stRC should not be used to describe
diffusion on the cell membrane due to structural differences be—
tween membrane and cytoplasm, and the two—dimensional
nature of such diffusion.

Small sizes of prokaryotic cell also affect the long—time behav—
iour of diffusing objects. This is known as conﬁned diffusion
(Ochab—Marcinek and Holyst, 2011). Nevertheless, from the
normal, three—dimensional DCs (short time diffusion), one can
draw constructive conclusions. For example, English et a]. (2011)
on the basis of short—time diffusion measurements have charac—
terized the catalytic cycle of RelA protein.

Eukaryotic cells are much larger than bacteria. Therefore,
measurements of diffusion in these cells are easier and can be
performed in the individual organelles [e.g. nucleus (Pederson,
2000)]. In previous work, we showed that it is possible to con—
struct a reference curve for the cytoplasm of mammalian HeLa
and Swiss 3T3 cells (Kalwarczyk, et al, 2011). However, based
on comparison of the results obtained by Lukacs et a]. (2000) for
the cytoplasm and the nucleus of HeLa cancer cell, we expect
that the stRC determined for each cellular organelle is differ—
ent. Furthermore, as stRC depends on the structure of the
environment where diffusion occurs, it should be unique for a
given cell or even organelle.

4 CONCLUSION

The method presented above has a high predictive power.
Although, so far a large error of the method (40% for proteins),
the experimentally measured DCs coincide remarkably well with
the predicted DCs (cf. Fig. 4). Therefore, measurements of DCs
of several inert probes in a single cell type allow to determine the
DCs of thousands of proteins and other (macro)molecules.
Correctly designed experiment would require involvement of dif—
ferent experimental techniques (NMR, FRAP, FCS, particle
tracking) and the use of probes in a wide range of sizes.

One needs to know the DC of a given probe in water and/or
the hydrodynamic radius of this probe. Additionally for the same
probe, measurements of diffusion in cytoplasm of the cell should
be performed. Sizes of selected probes should be uniformly dis—
tributed along the logarithmic scale of sizes. We showed that
only 20 measurements are required to predict the cytoplasmic
DC of the typical protein with 20% accuracy.

Analysis of the stRC allows to determine the characteristic
length scales Rh and 5, and the DC of any (macro)molecule in the
cytoplasm. For the cytoplasm of E. coli, we found that Rh is
surprisingly well correlated with the average radius of the
DNA loops forming the nucleoid. This suggests that the nucloeid
is the main crowding agent (responsible for the macroscopic vis—
cosity) in the cytoplasm of E. coli.

Finally, it should be noted that there are no additional require—
ments (except experimental data) to construct analogous data—
base of DCs in other systems such as the nucleus or
mitochondria of eukaryotic cells. We also believe that stRC
can be easily adopted to calculate other types of mobility, includ—
ing one—dimensional sliding, velocity of molecular motors, etc.,
as they all are inversely proportional to the viscosity.

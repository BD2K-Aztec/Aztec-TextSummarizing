Fig. l. The workﬂow overview of STAMS. STAMS overlays GWAS gene-based p-
values on a graph of gene-gene interaction conﬁdence scores from the STRING database.
In the resulting graph, circular nodes represent genes with size proportional to l-(p-value)
of the gene‘s individual association with the phenotype. Graph edges are edges from the
STRING database, weighted with conﬁdence scores calculated by STRING. Using a
search based on EWidinGWAS, STAMS identiﬁes modules of genes that have high

biological coherence and an enrichment of GWAS signal,

(1) Neighborhood (31,550 edges): A conﬁdence level based on how
often the two genes are repeatedly in close neighborhood in
prokaryotic genomes. The median conﬁdence is 169; mean
conﬁdence is 181.

(2) Fusion (1,070 edges): A conﬁdence level based on the
number of times that the genes fuse in different spe-
cies. Median conﬁdence is 6; mean conﬁdence is 77.5.

(3) Co-ocurrence: (11,654 edges): A conﬁdence level based on the
number of times the two proteins co-occur in different spe-
cies. Median conﬁdence is 152; mean conﬁdence is 159.

(4) Coexpression (534,720 edges): A conﬁdence level based on
how much the genes are co-expressed across species. Median
conﬁdence is 185; mean conﬁdence is 231.

(5) Experimental (197,709 edges): A conﬁdence level based on pro-
tein interaction data from protein-protein interaction data-
bases, e.g. MIPS. Median conﬁdence is 266; mean conﬁdence
is 349.

(6) Database (126,374 edges): A conﬁdence level based on protein
interaction groups from curated databases, e.g. Reactome
(Croft et a1.; 2010). Median conﬁdence is 899; mean conﬁ-
dence is 867.

(7) Textmining (text) (1,150,456 edges): A conﬁdence level based
on protein interaction groups extracted from abstracts and
open source full texts of scientiﬁc literature. Median conﬁ-
dence is 201; mean conﬁdence is 244.

(8) Combined Score (CS) (1,684,531 edges): These scores are com-
bined as if thev are independent data sources:

Confidence(e) = 1000* (1—H:=1(1—c[ei) /1000))

where ci(e) is the conﬁdence level of the edge according to data type i.
Median conﬁdence is 229; mean conﬁdence is 319.

2.1.2 STAMS speciﬁc: Edge weights

We transform the conﬁdence levels from STRING into edge weights for
the graph. To easily utilize the EngmGWAS search function, we de-
ﬁned edgeweight(e)= (p"(conﬁdence(e) / 1000) where q)" is the inverse
CDF (quantile function) of the normal distribution, resulting in an ap-
proximately standard normal distribution of edge weights.

2.1.3 STAMS specific: Node weights

We transform the gene-level p-values into node weights. In order to
make direct comparisons to EngmGWAS, and to directly apply the
search function from EngmGWAS, we deﬁned nodeweight as node-
weight(v) = (p"(1-p) where p denotes the gene-based p-value of the node
v.

2.1.4 STAMS: Scoring

With the node weights and edge weights as described above, the search-
ing and scoring functions from EngmGWAS were used without altera-
tion. Brieﬂy, the module score is deﬁned by:

ZeeE edgeweight(e) Evev nodeweight(v]

VNO.ofE \lNo.0fV

where E and V represent the edges and nodes of the module, and A is a

5:21 +(1—l)

parameter between 0 and I that balances edge-weight and GWAS sig-
nals. We used the default permutation-based approach from
EW_deWAS for choosing 2».

2.1.5 STAMS: Searching
We used the greedy searching function from EngmGWAS without

alteration. Brieﬂy:
(1) Assign a seed module M and calculate the module score S(M)
ofM. Initially; the seed module is a single gene.
(2) Examine all of the ﬁrst-order neighbors of M, and identify the

neighbor node me that generals the maximum increment of
the module score.

(3) Add Nmax to the current module M if the score increment is

greater than S(M) x r, where r is a parameter that decides the
magnitude of the increment. We used r : 0.1.

(4) Repeat steps 1-3 until no more neighbors can be added.

2.1.6 STAMS speciﬁc: Normalization of module score

For each module, we calculate a background distribution of 100,000
randomly generated modules by perrnuting the node weights. Lambda
and the edge weights remain the same as the observed module. We cal-
culate the mean u and standard deviation 6 of the 100,000 scores. For a
candidate module with score S(M), the normalized score is
SN(M)=(S(M)-p)/o. Modules are ranked by SN. An empirical p-value is
calculated as the fraction of permuted scores that meet or exceed the
observed score.

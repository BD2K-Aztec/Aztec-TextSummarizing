Abstract

Motivation: One of the main goals of large scale methylation studies is to detect differentially
methylated loci. One way is to approach this problem sitewise, i.e. to find differentially methylated
positions (DMPs). However, it has been shown that methylation is regulated in longer genomic re—
gions. So it is more desirable to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) instead of DMPs.
The new high coverage arrays, like llluminas 450k platform, make it possible at a reasonable cost.
Few tools exist for DMR identification from this type of data, but there is no standard approach.
Results: We propose a novel method for DMR identification that detects the region boundaries ac—
cording to the minimum description length (MDL) principle, essentially solving the problem of
model selection. The significance of the regions is established using linear mixed models. Using
both simulated and large publicly available methylation datasets, we compare seqlm performance
to alternative approaches. We demonstrate that it is both more sensitive and specific than compet—
ing methods. This is achieved with minimal parameter tuning and, surprisingly, quickest running
time of all the tried methods. Finally, we show that the regional differential methylation patterns
identified on sparse array data are confirmed by higher resolution sequencing approaches.
Availability and Implementation: The methods have been implemented in R package seqlm that is
available through Github: https://github.com/raiv0k0|de/seqlm

identical methylation patterns. This feature has been seen already in
the early sequencing studies (Eckhardt et al., 2006) and it has been
also shown that methylation is regulated in longer regions (Lienert
et al., 2011). While strong spatial correlation is a dominant feature
in the data, common analysis methods do not take this into account.
For example, differential methylation analysis is commonly per—
formed in a sitewise manner (Marabita et al., 2013; Wesser and
Emes, 2012), thus ignoring correlations between probes. To take
spatial correlations into account when performing the analysis, it is
natural to search for differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in—
stead of sites. Statistically, it could improve the sensitivity of the
analysis and make the results less redundant. Biologically, differen—
tial methylation supported by multiple independent probes is less
likely to represent an experimental artefact. DMR centric analysis
has been performed in multiple studies (Bell et al., 2012; Lokk et al.,
2014; Slieker et al., 2013) and there are several tools available for it
(Jaffe et al., 2012; Pedersen et al., 2012; Sofer et al., 2013; Wang
et al., 2012).

However, despite the numerous tools available, there is no stand—
ard approach for DMR identification. One possibility is to use pre—
defined regions that are based on genomic features such as gene
parts or CpG islands. This has been implemented in an R package
IMA (Wang et al., 2012), but it has several shortcomings. Such an
analysis often reveals large amount of regions that cover the same
set of differentially methylated sites, while their rankings are more
based on the concordance between the borders of true DMRs and
predefined regions than the true extent of differential methylation.

Another, a more general approach is to define the regions dy—
namically based on the data. One such method is Comb—p (Kechris
et al., 2010; Pedersen et al., 2012) that combines single site P—values
by using sliding windows and taking into account the correlation be—
tween sites. This method operates on P—values, which makes it flex—
ible and computationally efficient. However, the DMRs are then
based on summary statistics and this may lose some information
compared to modeling directly on the measurements. Also, the user
must pick the minimum P—value required to start a region, and the
resulting regions strongly depend on this parameter value.

Maybe the most well—known method is bump hunting (Jaffe
et al., 2012), integrated into R package minfi (Aryee et al., 2014).
Essentially, it performs site—level analysis on spatially smoothed data
and then applies some rules to aggregate the sites into regions.
Significance of these regions is assessed using permutations. The
number and nature of bumphunter results depends strongly on the
effect size cutoff and smoothing window size parameters that are
hard to interpret in biological terms and thus tricky to optimize.
Second, due to smoothing the method is unable to detect single—site
differential methylation (Jaffe et al., 2012), making it less effective
in sparsely covered regions.

Another tool Aclust (Sofer et al., 2013) defines the regions by
gradually clustering the consecutive sites together. The significance
of identified clusters is tested using the Generalized Estimating
Equations (GEE) model. This approach relies on an even larger
number of user—defined parameters, such as correlation metric, ag—
glomeration method, correlation threshold, etc.

In this article we present a novel method for identifying DMRs.
Probes are grouped into regions based similarity of differential
methylation profiles by using the Minimum Description Length
(MDL) principle. The significance of these regions is estimated using
linear mixed models. Such an information theoretic background
makes the model flexible in a variety of situations without the need
of extensive parameter tuning. For validation, we show that our ap—
proach is effective in finding true DMRs while appropriately

controlling the number of false positives both on simulated and real
methylation datasets.

2 Approach

Biologically, a differentially methylated region is a rather intuitive
concept—a collection of consecutive metylation sites in the DNA
where the average methylation levels differ significantly between the
tissues of interest. However, the intuition does not translate into
clear definition that could be used for DMR finding. For example,
should we prioritize DMRs that cover most CpG sites, span the larg—
est genomic distance or exhibit the highest differential methylation.
As there is no obvious biological criterion to optimize, there are
many ad hoc methods for finding DMRs.

From the statistical point of view, however, it is clearer what we
want to achieve. We know that the dataset contains redundant in—
formation in terms of spatially correlated probes. The goal is to find
a smaller set of features by combining the correlated consecutive
sites into regions, while preserving the underlying signal. The result—
ing smaller and more independent set of features can then be used
for performing differential methylation analysis.

In seqlm we implement this strategy as the following three stage
procedure:

1. The genome is divided into initial segments, according to the dis—
tances between consecutive CpG probes.

2. These segments are subdivided into regions, based on the differ—
ential methylation patterns.

3. For each region, the statistical signiﬁcance of differential methy—
lation is assessed.

Stages 1 and 3 are relatively straightforward to carry out, while
the main novelty of the method lies in step 2. Next we introduce all
the stages (illustrated in Fig. 1) one by one.

2.1 Initial segmentation
As the second step in our analysis is computationally rather inten—
sive, we do the initial partitioning using simpler rules.

CpG sites on the genome cluster into tighter groups near pro—
moters and other functional elements and the arrays concentrate
also on these regions. Thus, we do not lose much information if we
identify denser regions just based on genomic location. Therefore,
we have chosen 1000 bp as an upper bound for the distance between
two consecutive probes to belong into one region.

The exact cut—off value was determined by exploring in a large
dataset (Lokk et al., 2014) the relation between methylation correl—
ation of consecutive sites and the genomic distance (Fig. 1). As ex—
pected very close pairs of probes (less than 100 bp) are highly
correlated. However, when the distance is already more than
1000 bp, the preferential correlation effect seems to be diminished.

Such initial segmentation creates many isolated sites and short
regions, but also substantial amount of more populous segments in
areas of sufficient coverage of the array. In the next step, these will
be subdivided into regions according to their methylation patterns.

2.2 Refined methylation based segmentation
Given a continuous stretch of CpG probes, we want to divide this
into regions with homogeneous methylation patterns with respect to
our variable of interest, e.g. extent of differential methylation is con—
stant within each segment.

Let 3),, denote the methylation value for sample 1' and site i and x,
be the variable describing the samples. For two distinct groups,

regions, one could potentially limit the complexity growth, by intro—
ducing a restriction on the number of probes in one segment.
Finally, the calculations can be trivially parallelized, making them
feasible even for large datasets.

2.3 Assessing statistical significance
The previous step provides a collection of genomic regions and sin—
gle sites. To identify which of these regions show condition specific
methylation, we have to assess the extent of differences in methyla—
tion. As we already fitted linear models in previous step to all of the
regions, we can use the same models to assess the significance of
these DMRs. However, the model (1) does not take into account
that nearby measurements of a same sample are highly correlated.
Hence, resulting P—values are greatly inflated.

To take these correlations into account, we must add a sample
specific methylation baseline bi ~ N(0. 0,2,) to the model (1). The re—
sulting linear mixed model

351‘: H; + ﬁxi + bi + 8i}. (4)

distinguishes sample— and condition—based effects. Interestingly, the
extra term in the model (4) does not change the estimate of [3 com—
pared to (1), but adjusts the respective P—values appropriately.
Finally, these P—values must be adjusted for multiple testing.

In general, using the same variable x, for finding segmentation
and assessing the significance of regions can inflate P—values. For ex—
ample, selecting region boundaries based on strength of differential
methylation or removing ‘less—promising’ regions would immedi—
ately introduce bias. However, in our approach, the second stage
maximizes coherence of the regions rather than differential methyla—
tion and we do not select regions before applying model (4). As a re—
sult, the method does not introduce false positive findings (see also
Table 1).

3 Results

We demonstrate the utility of seqlm method in three parts. First, we
study the statistical properties and performance of seqlm and other
methods on simulated data. Second, we apply the methods to a large
public methylation dataset covering 17 different tissues. In all cases
we compare seqlm with bumphunter, Aclust, Comb—p and IMA.
Finally, we validate several DMRs that were identified using seqlm
on Illumina 450K chip data with Sanger sequencing.

3.1 Simulation study

To study sensitivity and specificity of the DMR finding algorithms
we need a dataset where we know true differential methylation pat—
terns. For that we permuted labels on a real dataset and introduced
differential methylation by changing methylation levels inside spe—
cific regions (see Section 4 for further details). This allowed us to
preserve much of the structure of the original data, but at the same
time introduce controlled variation into it. Without introducing any
differential methylation, this schema was effective in generating
data that was distributed according to the null hypothesis—the site—
wise t—test P—values follow expected uniform distribution.

To test our algorithm, we run all DMR finding algorithms on
the simulated data, using FDR 0.05 as a cutoff. After that we
counted the number of true and false positive results. If a detected
DMR overlapped with a region where we inserted differential
methylation, we classified this as a true positive, otherwise as a false
positive.

The results can be seen in Table 1. Each row corresponds to a
different p value which represents the average generated effect size
between the two groups. The columns show the number of detected
regions or number of sites within them. Together with the true and
false positives we also show the number of missed regions and sites.

seq/m

 

The first row serves as a check on the statistical validity of the al—
gorithms, as we do not expect to find any DMRs for u : 0. Neither
bumphunter or seqlm find any DMRs in this case. Overall, the num—
ber of regions bumphunter identifies is an order of magnitude
smaller compared to other methods, even with very large effect
sizes.

On the other hand, Aclust identifies 87 significant regions that
cover 255 sites for the first row. This indicates, that the Generalised
Estimating Equations (GEE) model used by Aclust, combined with
the FDR correction, might be inappropriate for this type of data.
Moreover, the proportion of false positive sites stays considerably
higher than the expected 5% even if we introduce differential
methylation. Interestingly, with Comb—p the number of false posi—
tives is not high overall, but there are several of them even if the
dataset does not contain any signal. Thus, both Comb—p and Aclust
can return too many false positives, especially, when the signal in
the data is weak. Even if the number of true positive sites is compar—
able, it is still consistently lower than for seqlm.

In terms of sensitivity, the performance of seqlm is comparable
to Aclust and Comb—p. For higher effect sizes, it finds consistently
larger number of true positive sites, while keeping the number of
false positives below 5% for most cases.

The comparison with the IMA package is more complicated,
since IMA outputs overlapping results. For example, significantly
differentially methylated region can partially overlap with several
CpG islands, exons, promoters and other functionally relevant re—
gions. Thus for the IMA results we calculated two sets of true and
false positive values: for all and for unique results. The results for
IMA are given in Supplementary Table 1.

In brief, the IMA package finds the same order of magnitude of
unique sites and regions as Aclust and seqlm without exceeding 5%
threshold for false positives. The main problem with IMA is that on
average each site is reported as a member of two regions, but in
many cases few differentially methylated sites can drive the signifi—
cance of tens of regions. One could merge the overlapping signifi—
cant regions as we did, but this would lose the interpretability of the
results.

To summarize, seqlm displays the most sensitivity and specificity
among the four alternative algorithms.

3.2 Comparisons on the 17 tissues data
As a more practical comparison, we also applied all DMR finding
methods also on a real dataset that describes methylation in 17

tissues. We searched for DMRs specific to single tissues and per—
formed sitewise t—test as a comparison. The numbers of significant
regions and sites covered by those is given in Table 2.

The results are consistent with the simulation study.
Bumphunter is finding a significantly smaller number of DMRs than
Aclust, Comb—p or seqlm.

Compared to the single site analysis, seqlm consistently identifies
10—15% more differentially methylated sites. As the single site ana—
lysis can be considered a good baseline, we can see that the seqlm al—
gorithm does not pick up spurious signals. Instead, it gives roughly
the same set of sites grouped into fewer regions.

The behaviour of Aclust and Comb—p is less consistent. In some
cases, the number of reported sites of Aclust is several times higher
than for single site t—test. In other occasions, the numbers are more
comparable but always higher. Given the over—sensitivity of Aclust
we showed on simulated data, such differences are rather suspicious
and are likely to contain more than 5% false positives. Comb—p, in
turn, seems to find many regions in comparisons where other meth—
ods do not find much and less in other comparisons with stronger
signals.

When considering length of the identified regions we can also see
slight differences. Supplementary Figure 51 details the length distri—
bution of all regions with at least 2 sites in Table 2. Bumphunter
tends to identify the longest regions and does not return almost any
regions with less than 3 sites, as the length of the region is also an
important criterion in region selection. In other cases the distribu—
tion was more skewed towards short regions with Aclust giving the
shortest and seqlm and combp giving slightly longer
correspondingly.

In summary, seqlm seems to give a consistent improvement over
single site analysis without returning a suspiciously high amount of
differentially methylated sites.

3.3 Validation of identified DMRs
While the 450K sites on Illumina methylation arrays represent a
marked improvement over previous technologies, they still represent
only 1.5% of the 29M CpG sites on the genome. Thus, it is not a
priori clear that DMR—s inferred from such low—resolution measure—
ments reflect biological reality and are not technical artifacts. To ad—
dress this concern, we have validated 14 of the DMR—s identified in
Table 2 using Sanger sequencing.

Figure 2A shows an example of such a validation. We can see
that there is good overlap between the results of two approaches at

Table 2. For each approach, the number of significant DMRs and the corresponding number of sites has been given

4.4 Sanger sequencing

For validation we selected 14 DMR—s that were tissue specific,
showed large effect size and where it was possible to design primers.
Primers for PCR amplification of the bisulfite—treated DNA were de—
signed using MethPrimer (Li and Dahiya, 2002) and are listed in
Additional file 9. The 20L reaction mixes contained 80 mM Tris—
HCl (pH 9.4—9.5), 20 mM (NH4)ZSO4, 0.02% Tween—20 PCR buf-
fer, 3 mM MgC12, 1>< Betaine, 0.25 mM dNTP mix, 2U Smart—Taq
Hot DNA polymerase (Naxo, Tartu, Estonia), 50 pmol forward pri—
mer, 50 pmol reverse primer and 20 ng bisulfite—treated genomic
DNA. The PCR cycling conditions were: 15 min at 95 °C for enzyme
activation, followed by 17 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 45 s at 62 °C and
1205 at 72 °C, with a final —0.5 °C /cycle step—down gradient over
21 cycles of 305 at 95 °C, 305 at 52 °C and 1205 at 72 °C. The
sequencing results were analyzed with Mutation Surveyor software
(Softgenetics, State College, PA, USA).

5 Discussion

The method as defined in this article opens up a number of future
directions for development. The current model can also handle con—
tinuous variables in addition to the two groups of data. Thus, it is
possible to use seqlm to search for methylation quantitative trait loci
(meQTLs). In such analysis, even small improvements in statistical
power can have huge consequences.

The method can be generalized to handle raw sequencing data
with methylation counts instead of aggregated methylation values.
For that we must replace linear regression with logistic regression.
The change only alters the model fitting inside fixed region and not
the core of the dynamic programming routine.

The MDL framework underlying seqlm is a powerful way to
identify genomic regions. By employing different statistical models it
is possible to specify the properties of the desired regions. For ex—
ample one can include more sophisticated linear models to test more
complex hypotheses or use clustering methods instead, to perform
unsupervised region finding.

6 Conclusion

We presented a novel approach for DMR identification, described
as a three—stage process. First, the data is divided into smaller seg—
ments based on genomic distance between consecutive probes.
Then, each of these segments is divided into regions with consistent
differential methylation patterns. For this, all possible segmentations
are considered and the optimal one is chosen according to the MDL
principle. Finally, the significance of differential methylation in each
region is assessed using linear mixed models. In our algorithm, the
latter two steps are naturally related as both the segmentation and
assessing the statistical significance are based on the I} parameter.
We showed that seqlm performs well on simulated data, being
both more sensitive and more specific than the alternative methods.
On a real dataset we can see that DMRs found by seqlm cover more
sites than other methods while controlling the Type I error rate. At
the same time, the redundancy within the results is smaller as the close
sites are reported together. Finally, we validated 14 DMRs using
Sanger sequencing and managed to show good correlation between
the array and sequencing based estimates of differential methylation.

Abstract

Summary: DNAshapeR predicts DNA shape features in an ultra—fast, high—throughput manner from
genomic sequencing data. The package takes either nucleotide sequence or genomic coordinates
as input and generates various graphical representations for visualization and further analysis.
DNAshapeR further encodes DNA sequence and shape features as user—defined combinations of
k—mer and DNA shape features. The resulting feature matrices can be readily used as input of vari—
ous machine learning software packages for further modeling studies.

Availability and implementation: The DNAshapeR software package was implemented in the stat—
istical programming language R and is freely available through the Bioconductor project at https://
www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/DNAshapeR.htm| and at the GitHub developer

1 Introduction

Two distinct readout modes have emerged as crucial components of
protein—DNA recognition (Abe et (11., 2015). These modes include
sequence—based readout of direct contacts with the functional groups
of the bases (base readout) and structure—based readout of intrinsic
deviations from a canonical double helix (shape readout). DNA
shape readout was originally described based on the analysis of co—
crystal structures of protein—DNA complexes. Studies of DNA
shape readout were then extended to massive datasets of protein—
interacting DNA sequences via the use of DNAshape, a method for
the high—throughput prediction of DNA structural features (Zhou
et (11., 2013). Using DNAshape as the underlying tool, a motif

database for transcription factor (TF) binding sites, TFBSshape
(Yang et (11., 2014) and a genome browser database for DNA shape
annotations, GBshape (Chiu et (11., 2015), were developed.

Rules that determine the binding affinity between TFs and
their binding sites can be statistically learned from the data
derived from in vitro high—throughput binding assays. Although
sequence—based methods have long been used to model TF binding
specificities, high—throughput prediction of DNA shape enabled us
to develop methods that leverage both DNA sequence and
shape information. Trained with either linear regression or sup—
port vector regression algorithms, shape—augmented models were
consistently shown to outperform sequence—based methods in

BED format or derived from public databases. The core of DNAshapeR includes a high-throughput approach for the prediction of DNA shape features. MGW,
HelT, ProT and Roll can then be visualized in the form of plots, heat maps or genome browser tracks or used for the assembly of feature vectors of user-defined

DNAshape is currently released as a stand—alone web service
(Zhou et 41]., 2013). Its pre—defined functionality and internet band—
width—bounded performance made it difficult to use in genome—wide
studies. To address these issues, we developed DNAshapeR, an
R/Bioconductor package that can generate DNA shape predictions
in an easy—to—use, easy—to—integrate and easy—to—extend manner. The
output can be readily integrated into other high—throughput genomic
analysis platforms.

2 High-throughput DNA shape prediction

The core of DNAshapeR is the DNAshape prediction method (Zhou
et 41]., 2013), which uses a sliding pentamer window to derive the
structural features minor groove width (MGW), helix twist (HelT),
propeller twist (ProT) and Roll (Fig. 1) from all—atom Monte Carlo
simulations. These DNA shape features were observed in various
cocrystal structures as playing an important role in achieving pro—
tein—DNA binding specificity. High—throughput predictions of DNA
shape have shed light on the DNA binding specificity of TFs (He
et 41]., 2015; Murphy et 41]., 2015) and were shown to be predictive
of replication origins (Comoglio et 41]., 2015).

The DNAshapeR package enables ultra—fast, high—throughput
predictions of shape features for thousands of genomic sequences
and generates various graphical outputs of the data (Fig. 1;
Supplementary Data). The modular design of DNAshapeR enables
the expansion to additional features, such as conformational ﬂexi—
bility, biophysical properties and methylation status, to be added in
future releases of the DNAshapeR package.

3 DNA shape and k-mer feature encoding

Besides DNA shape predictions and data visualization, DNAshapeR
can also be used to generate feature vectors for user—defined models.
These models consist of sequence features (1mer, 2mer, 3mer),
shape features (MGW, Roll, ProT, HelT) or any combination of
those features (Fig. 1; Supplementary Data). DNAshapeR encodes
sequence as binary features. DNA shape features are normalized by
default and can include second—order shape features. The detailed
definitions of sequence and shape features were provided in an ear—
lier study (Zhou et 41]., 2015).

The feature encoding function of DNAshapeR enables the gener—
ation of any user—defined subset of these features. The result of the
feature encoding for each sequence is a chimera feature vector.
Feature encoding of multiple sequences thus results in a feature ma—
trix, which can be used as input for a variety of statistical machine
learning methods.

4 DISCUSSION

Protection of human subjects and other study policies make it
difficult to share individual—level data, even in well—organized
consortia. Thus, meta—analysis is strongly preferable to joint ana—
lysis. The MASS software enables one to perform meta—analysis
of score statistics for sequencing studies, which is statistically as
efﬁcient as and indeed numerically equivalent to joint analysis of
individual—level data. This software can also be used to combine
results from other types of genetic studies as well as non—genetic
studies.

In meta—analysis of sequencing data, the participating studies
should use the same annotation ﬁle so that the summary statis—
tics are generated in a consistent manner across studies. This
does not mean that the variants have to be the same among
studies. If a genetic variable is missing in one study, then zero
can be used as a placeholder in the summary statistics and MASS
will combine all available information.

The calculation of the burden scores requires speciﬁcation of
the MAFs. The MAFs may be estimated separately in each study
or jointly across all studies; they may also be determined from an
external source. We recommend that the same MAFs be used by
all participating studies. In this way, the same variants are
included in the calculations of the burden scores among the
studies, and the MAF thresholds for the VT test are consistent
across the studies.

For studies that use different exome capturing kits or studies
in which some have exome sequencing while others have exome
chip data, the input variants are different. If the genetic variable
pertains to the genotype of a variant and that variant is not
measured in the kth study, then we simply set the corresponding
entries in U0“) and Wk) to zero, so that MASS will combine all
available data. If the genetic variable pertains to a burden score,
then a variant that is absent in a study will not contribute to the
calculation of the burden score for that study. The score statistics
from such studies can still be combined in MASS, although the
results need to be interpreted with extra care.

If the burden score is a (weighted) linear combination of the
genotype values (e. g. the total number of mutations or a
weighted sum of the mutation counts), then the score statistics
for the burden and VT tests are (weighted) linear combinations
of the score statistic for testing the null hypothesis that the geno—
types of individual variants are not associated with the trait of
interest. In that case, it would be sufﬁcient to input only the score
vector and information matrix for individual variants because

they can be used to create the score statistics and information
matrices for the burden, VT and SKAT tests. We did not take
this approach because it requires the burden scores to be calcu—
lated under the additive mode of inheritance. Indeed, it has
become a common practice to deﬁne the burden score as the
presence or absence of any mutation within a gene rather than
the total number or weighted linear combination of the muta—
tions. SCORE—Seq allows burden scores to be calculated under
the additive, dominant or recessive mode of inheritance. By
asking the user to input the score statistics and information
matrices for each speciﬁc test, MASS can accommodate any
mode of inheritance.

MASS adopts the ﬁxed—effect model, which assumes that the
genetic effects are the same among the participating studies. This
approach will have reasonable power as long as the effects are in
the same direction across studies. An alternative approach is the
random—effect model, under which the effects in different studies
follow a normal distribution. The random—effect model tends to
be less powerful than the ﬁxed—effect model even when the effects
are heterogeneous and thus has rarely been used in genetic asso—
ciation studies.

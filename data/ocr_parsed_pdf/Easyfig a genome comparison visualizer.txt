ABSTRACT

Summary: Easyfig is a Python application for creating linear
comparison figures of multiple genomic loci with an easy-to-use
graphical user interface. BLAST comparisons between multiple
genomic regions, ranging from single genes to whole prokaryote
chromosomes, can be generated, visualized and interactively
coloured, enabling a rapid transition between analysis and the
preparation of publication quality figures.

Availability: Easyfig is freely available (under a GPL license) for
download (for Mac OS X, Unix and Microsoft Windows) from the
SourceForge web site: http://easyfig.sourceforge.net/.

1 INTRODUCTION

Comparative genomics involves the comparison of sequenced
genomes, particularly for the identiﬁcation of insertions, deletions
and variation in syntenic regions. Visualizing alignments between
speciﬁc regions of multiple genomes is a critical step in identifying
genotypic differences that underlie phenotypic changes between
strains or species. For example, comparisons between related
prokaryote genomes can highlight mobile elements such as
integrons, prophage or pathogenicity islands. Preparation of clear
and accurate images based on these genomic comparisons is
typically accomplished ad hoc by tedious manual compilation (e.g.
Thomson et (11., 2004; Venturini et (11., 2010) or using screen-
snapshots from analysis tools (e.g. Jackson et (11., 2010; Kozak
et (11., 2010). Artemis comparison tool (ACT; Carver et (11., 2005)
and Mauve (Darling et (11., 2010) are both examples of excellent
comparative genome analysis tools that are widely used to generate
ﬁgures for publication, but are not designed for this purpose and
generally lose clarity when displaying several regions at once.
Recently, an elegant visualization tool was developed (Guy et (11.,
2010); however, its dependence on R makes it difﬁcult for users
unfamiliar with scripting languages.

Here, we describe Easyﬁg, a Python application for plotting
comparison ﬁgures of multiple genomes or genomic regions from
annotation ﬁles (e.g. GenBank and EMBL) and tabular comparison
ﬁles [e.g. BLAST (Altschul et (11., 1990)]. Easyﬁg has been designed
to enable any biologist to visualize comparisons between multiple
genomes or genomic regions and produce clear, publication quality
images quickly and easily.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

Easyﬁg is a Python application that uses the Tkinter windows
system. It is available as an executable ﬁle, or as a Python script.
As such it is platform independent and can be used in a Microsoft
Windows, Linux or Mac OS X environment. No Unix or scripting
knowledge is required so that it is easily accessible to the average
biologist with little or no bioinformatics or computing experience.
The graphical user interface (GUI) permits images to be drawn with
minimal user input, yet allows highly customizable ﬁgures to be
generated for closer analysis or publication.

Easyﬁg accepts multiple sequences with or without annotation
in stande formats (i.e. GenBank and EMBL). The input DNA
sequence is rendered to scale as a solid black line centered vertically.
Easyﬁg can handle a variety of loci lengths, from ﬁill prokaryote
genomes (Fig. 1A) or small eukaryote chromosomes (5—10Mb),
down to individual loci or genes (Fig. 1B). The relative orientation
of each region (forward/reverse) can be speciﬁed so that input
sequences can be ‘ﬂipped’ if required. By default, Easyﬁg will
produce an image showing only gene features, but other features
such as tRNAs, coding sequences (CDS), misc_features or a
user-speciﬁed feature, can be added. Features can be displayed
as rectangles, directional arrows, arrows representing frame and
direction or a pointer to the start of the feature. Features can be
coloured via the GUI or if the annotation ﬁle already has colour
information, such as those that can be assigned using Artemis
(Rutherford et (11., 2000), each feature will be individually coloured
according to the input ﬁle (i.e. using the feature qualiﬁer: /colour=).
Introns or pseudogenes with insertions in them are represented by
dashed brackets joining each of the coding regions. The pixel height
and width of features are customizable. Genomic regions can also
be aligned left, right, centered or directly perpendicular to their best
BLAST hit. A ‘zoom’ feature enables subregions of large sequence
ﬁles to be speciﬁed via the GUI and examined in more detail. The
ﬁgure can also show custom graphs displaying guanine-cytosine
content, read coverage (calculated by Easyﬁg from an assembly ﬁle
in .ace format), or a user-deﬁned graph.

BLAST comparisons (BLASTn, tBLASTx) between two or more
loci can also be generated by the Easyﬁg interface, provided
BLAST+ or legacy BLAST is available in a users path (details of
how to set this up are included in the documentation for Easyﬁg).
Alternatively, previously generated tabular comparison ﬁles can
be loaded into Easyﬁg, including any pairwise alignment output
(e.g MUMmer) that has been converted to BLAST hit table format.
The Easyﬁg interface allows customization of the minimum expect
values, lengths and identities of BLAST hit to be displayed in the
ﬁnal image. The hits are coloured on a gradient according to the
BLAST identity value. Inverted matches can be shown using a

different colour gradient. The colour scheme, gradient settings and
height in pixels of the alignment can also be deﬁned by the user.

If required, identity and scale legends will be embedded in the
image along with speciﬁc annotations such as a scale bar and a
colour gradient representing the identities of the BLAST hits.

Figures generated by Easyﬁg are saved in compressed bitmap
(bmp) or vector graphics (svg) format at a user-deﬁned resolution
so that they can be easily annotated and manipulated in an image-
editing program such as GIMP (www.gimp.org) if necessary.

In conclusion, Easyﬁg enables a variety of high-quality
comparative genomic images to be generated locally using a simple
GUI. A command-line version of Easyﬁg is also available, enabling
it to be incorporated into analysis pipelines.

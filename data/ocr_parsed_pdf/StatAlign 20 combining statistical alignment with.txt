StatAlign 2.0

 

alignment requires an evolutionary model in order to produce
phylogenetic probabilities, this second method of consensus
structure prediction is only available for the SCFG method.
We refer to this method as the phylogenetic averaging method.
To benchmark the methods, we took reference alignments from
Rfam (Griffiths—Jones et al., 2005). In a pre—f11tering step, we
discarded outlier sequences with many/long insertions and dele—
tions from each family. Indels were ﬁrst determined relative to a
family consensus sequence, then a total mismatch score was cal—
culated based on indel lengths, and sequences that had signiﬁ—
cantly larger mismatch score than the family mean were deleted.
From 44 families that remained, we took a random sample of 5
sequences, as Knudsen and Hein (1999) suggest this is adequate
to capture the evolutionary information. We then re—aligned the
sequences using MUSCLE (Edgar, 2009), MAFFT (Katoh et al.,
2005), Clustal Omega (Sievers et al., 2008) and StatAlign, and
predicted structures on the resulting alignments. Predictive ac—
curacy was assessed by F—score, the harmonic mean of sensitivity
and positive predictive value (Knudsen and Hein, 2003).

Table 1 gives the results of the benchmark. By considering
multiple alignments, the average F—score is at least as good or
better as many current alignment programs. In particular, the
averaging methods improve upon the structure prediction on the
StatAlign consensus alignment. When sequences are easy to
align, we might expect methods to perform similarly, but when
alignment is difﬁcult, a method which can consider multiple
alignments will produce fewer poor predictions.

Naturally, additional computational time is required for the
RNA secondary structure predictions, for which the algorithms
are cubic in the length of the alignment. For the base pair aver—
aging method, we require PPfold or RNAalifold to fold each of
the sample alignments. The phylogenetic averaging method is in
practice slightly faster (but with the same complexity), as the
inside—outside algorithms only runs once.

The user is also provided with additional scores relating to the
quality of secondary structure predictions. Firstly, the informa—
tion entropy (Sukosd et al., 2012) is calculated to give the user an
indication of how clear the signal of secondary structure predic—
tion is. Paired and unpaired column probabilities are calculated
using the Pfold model over alignment samples and averaged.
PPfold then uses these probabilities along with SCFG probabil—
ities to calculate the consensus entropy. The second score is a
reliability score, designed to give the user an indication of how
many base pairings are expected to be correctly predicted in a
particular secondary structure. The reliability score we calculate

is a modified version of the PPfold reliability score, which aver—
ages the posterior SCFG probabilities of base pairs and unpaired
bases. Our score considers only base pairs, and correlates more
strongly with the F—score measure of predictive accuracy.
Evaluating the new reliability score on the benchmarking dataset
showed that the R2 value between this reliability score and the
PPfold F—score increased from 0.2685 for the existing PPfold
reliability score to an R2 value of 0.4021 for our modif1ed reli—
ability score, when performing linear regression. These calcula—
tions are only available for the SCFG method.

Lastly, an option to automate StatAlign’s MCMC parameters
for RNA alignments has been includedipreviously, the user was
expected to specify the parameters of the MCMC run prior to
execution. The burn—in process is terminated when we get a sig—
niﬁcant decline in the log likelihood graph. The sample rate is
calculated by taking many samples and measuring the distances
between alignments: the rate is chosen to be the number of steps
such that the distance between alignments approaches a con—
stant. The MCMC run is terminated when adding more align—
ment samples no longer results in significant changes to the
consensus alignment. Automating the process in this way
allows the user to obtain desirable results which otherwise
might not be the case for a poor choice of parameters.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: There have been several studies on the micro-inversions
between human and chimpanzee, but there are large discrepancies
among their results. Furthermore, all of them rely on alignment
procedures or existing alignment results to identify inversions.
However, the core alignment procedures do not take very small
inversions into consideration. Therefore, their analyses cannot find
inversions that are too small to be detected by a classic aligner. We
call such inversions pico-inversions.

Results: We re-analyzed human—chimpanzee alignment from the
UCSC Genome Browser for micro-inplace-inversions and screened
for pico-inplace-inversions using a likelihood ratio test. We report that
the quantity of inplace-inversions between human and chimpanzee
is substantially greater than what had previously been discovered.
We also present the software tool PicolnversionMiner to detect
pico-inplace-inversions between closely related species.
Availability: Software tools, scripts and result data are available at

1 INTRODUCTION

An inversion is a genomic rearrangement where a piece of DNA is
replaced by its reverse complement and re-inserted into the genome.
When the reversed DNA piece is re-inserted at its original site, it is
called an inplace-inversion. Very large inversions can be observed
under a microscope. Yunis et (11. (1980) reported nine such large-
scale inversions between human and Chimpanzee. Submicroscopic
inversions are discovered by sequence analyses and are called micro-
inversions; their sizes range from dozens to millions of bases. Most
studies focusing on micro-inversions rely on genomic alignments;
therefore, the shortest detectable micro-inversion is limited by the
shortest signiﬁcant alignment. We call the inversions that are too
small to be detected by a genomic aligner pico-inversions. There
has not been any explicit study on pico-inversions; their existence
and prevalence have been unknown.

Characterization of inversions has been useful in any aspects
of biomedical research. Navarro et (11. (2003) suggested that very
large inversions might have been responsible for a speed up of
the speciation of human and Chimpanzee. There is also evidence

that inversions are related to some diseases (Gimelli et (11., 2003;
Osborne et (11., 2001; Visser et (11., 2005) and may suppress
recombination (Stefansson et (11., 2005). There have been reports
of inversion polymorphism in human genomes (Bansal et (11.,
2007; Feuk et (11., 2005; Sindi and Raphael, 2010; Szamalek
et (11., 2006), indicating that inversion is an important feature of
intraspecies genomic structure. Breakpoints deﬁned by inversions
have been used extensively in genome comparison and ancestral
genome reconstruction (Bourque et (11., 2002; Ma et (11., 2006;
Peng et (11., 2006; Sankoff, 2006). Chaisson et (11. (2006) used
inversions to reconstruct a phylogenetic species tree as a new
approach to supplement the traditional phylogenetic analysis based
on substitutions alone. We observed that some spurious alignments
in multispecies alignments are caused by undetected inversions.
Discovering such inversions and correcting their alignments can
improve alignment quality, which in turn can improve the accuracy
of downstream data analysis based on alignments.

Although human and Chimpanzee are the most Closely related
species, the studies on micro-inversions between them (Chaisson
et (11., 2006; Feuk et (11., 2005; Lee et (11., 2008; Ma et (11.,
2006) showed large discrepancies. The earliest result reported 1576
putative inversions (Feuk et (11., 2005), and later, it was found that
the majority of these were artifacts (Chaisson et (11., 2006; Kolb
et (11., 2009). Chaisson et (11. (2006) reported 426 inversions, and
the reﬁned method of Ma et (11. (2006) identiﬁed a similar number
of inversions; however, only ~59% of inversions were consistent
in these studies (Chaisson et (11., 2006). Lee et (11. (2008) reported
323 inversions among which 252 could be Clearly Characterized.
These discrepancies indicate that identifying inversions is difﬁcult,
even for Closely related species. The problem is even more difﬁcult
for more distantly related species because of greater sequence
divergence, higher frequency of inversions and higher likelihood
that the inversions are nested.

All these studies rely on alignments produced by BLASTZ
(Schwartz et (11., 2003) [now updated to LASTZ (Harris, 2007),
though the methodology remains largely the same], which is used
by major comparative genomic resources such as the UCSC Genome
Browser (Kent et (11., 2005) (hereafter referred to as the browser).
Below we illustrate some limitations of BLASTZ in aligning
inversions, as these observations will guide us in looking for missing
micro-inversions in the whole genome alignment. By examining this
typical genomic aligner, we argue that there exist pico-inversions
that are not detectable by the existing alignment tools.

Brieﬂy, BLASTZ aligns two sequences that are soft masked
where repetitive sequences are distinguished from non-repetitive
ones. BLASTZ starts by collecting hits between two non-repetitive
sequences using a seed of a certain pattern, then extends them

gaplessly in both directions, and ﬁnally extends them further while
allowing gaps to form alignment blocks. Once there is an alignment
between non-repetitive sequences, it behaves as an anchor and
extends into the ﬂanking regions where repetitive sequences can be
aligned. However, some orthologous repeats cannot be aligned due
to large indels that block the alignment extension from the anchor. In
Figure 1, the alignments in non-repeat regions extend into repeats, as
indicated by the gray diagonal lines. But, there is no alignment on
the browser between human positions hg19:Chr1:35,358,810 (b1)
and 35,359,676 (e1). The corresponding locations in Chimpanzee
are panTro3:Chr1:35,081,773 (b2) and 35,082,501 (e2). The dotted
diagonal line is a missing alignment due to the big gaps blocking the
alignment extension. A long run of unsequenced positions (which
is not rare in the Chimpanzee assembly) has the same effect as a
big gap. To obtain the alignments of inversions, one sequence is
aligned to the reverse complement of the other. Since there are
fewer orthologous non-repetitive sequences on the reverse strand
(assuming the majority of the sequence is not inverted), there are
fewer alignment anchors to extend into repeat regions. Therefore, it
is more difﬁcult to align inversions in genomic regions with repeats.
Again in Figure 1, the dotted antidiagonal line shows a missing
inversion discovered in our study. In this example, when aligning
human sequence with the reverse complement of Chimpanzee
sequence, there is no hit (because hits are only collected between
non-repetitive sequences), and therefore, there is no alignment. Even
after BLASTZ correctly produces an inversion as an alignment
block, it may be screened out in a post-processing step such as Chain-
net (Kent et (11 ., 2003) at the browser since Chain-net gives preference
to a long alignment block. When an inversion is surrounded by
strong alignments, its ﬂanking alignments may be so strong that
they compensate for the low score produced by the misalignment in
the middle, and the real inversion is discarded. Chaisson et (11 . (2006)
showed an example where an inversion of 290 bases was screened
out in Chain-net and spurious alignment was presented where the
inversion was supposed to be.

Indels in alignments can be as small as just one base, since the
gapped extension step in the alignment procedure is done via a
dynamic programming model, which explicitly accounts for gaps as
short as one base. However, inversions do not enjoy such special
treatment in the computational model. It was pointed out that
rearrangements may happen at all scales, but small rearrangements
are not detected by the alignment, because the aligner is not designed

to handle such small rearrangements (Kent et (11., 2003). The shortest
inversion found in large-scale alignments is determined by the
alignment signiﬁcance score threshold together with other alignment
parameters. For example, an alignment match has a score of 91 or
100 by default in BLASTZ, and the default alignment signiﬁcance
score threshold is 3000. Assuming that there is no gap or mismatch in
an alignment, the shortest signiﬁcant alignment is around 3000/ 100
~ 3000/91 (=30 ~ 33) bases. This tells us that the shortest inversion
that is detectable by BLASTZ (and thereafter Chain-net) is also
around this size. One cannot just simply decrease the alignment
signiﬁcance score threshold to ﬁnd the shorter inversions, because
it will produce a large number of spurious alignments.

Here we present an approach to detect pico-inplace-inversions
between human and Chimpanzee. Since there are large discrepancies
among previous studies on micro-inversions, we conduct our own
analysis on micro-inversions and apply several rules to ensure
accuracy of our discoveries. Since our goal of identifying micro-
inversions is to help study pico-inplace-inversions, we restrict
our analysis to micro-inplace-inversions. After we obtain micro-
inversions, we have an initial (under)estimate of the inversion
rate between human and Chimpanzee. We look for pico-inversions
starting from this initial rate and update it once we obtain convincing
pico-inversions. After several rounds of updating, this rate stabilizes
and gives us a more accurate estimate on the number of inplace-
inversions between two genomes. The pipeline of detecting pico-
inplace-inversions is implemented in PicoInversionMiner. We use
out-group information to preliminarily verify the pico-inversions
between human and Chimpanzee detected by this tool and use
simulations to systematically evaluate the tool.

2 METHODS

2.1 Detection of micro-inplace-inversions

Micro-inversions are long enough to form signiﬁcant alignments. Many of
them are recorded in chain-net alignment. Some are missing due to the
artifacts of the aligner or post-processing procedures as we described above.
We categorize micro-inplace-inversions into several types based on how we
look for them:

0 Type I: inversions that are recorded in chain-net as individual alignment
blocks. For this type, we need to carefully identify the inplace ones
and ensure that an inversion is not counted as multiple small ones
represented in several alignment blocks.

0 Type II: inversions that are not aligned at all due to artifacts of the
aligner that we discussed above (also shown in Fig. 1). We look for
such inversions between two adjacent alignment blocks. For a pair of
such blocks, we unmask the sequence segments between the two blocks
and run BLASTZ between these sequences. We then use the approach
for Type I to look for inversions among the resulted alignments.

0 Type III: inversions that are aligned by the aligner but screened out by
post-processing procedures. These inversions are inside an alignment
block of chain-net. For each alignment block, we unmask both
sequences and align the ﬁrst sequence with the reverse complement
of the second using BLASTZ. A resulted alignment is then potentially
a micro-inversion.

To avoid spurious and non-orthologous inversions, we enforce several
rules to the potential micro-inversions:

(1) An inversion must be surrounded by strong alignments on both
ﬂanking regions. The distances from an inversion to these alignments
must be within a threshold (e. g. 2000 bases).

(2) Since human and chimpanzee are very closely related and the
percentage of identical positions (PIP) between them is around
98.7%, as computed from the whole genome alignment, an alignment
of a low PIP is likely non-orthologous. We then require the PIP of an
inversion alignment be >95%.

(3

V

For aType III inversion, we further require that it intersects its original
alignment (to ensure it is inplace), and the inversion alignment is
signiﬁcantly better than the original alignment (e.g. the alignment
score of the inversion is 450 higher than the score of the original
alignment using default parameters of BLASTZ).

The counts of inversions of the above types are summarized in Table 1
with different thresholds for the distance from the inversion to its ﬂanking
alignments. We take a closer examination on the 198 Type I, II and III
inversions that have strong alignments on both ﬂanking regions of the
inversion within a distance of 100 bases. Chaisson et a1. (2006) reported
that one-third of inversions are associated with indels on ﬂanking sites. Our
result indicates a higher rate; 54% of the above inversions have at least
one gap on their ﬂanking sites. Kolb et a1. (2009) reported an even higher
proportion (89%) of (a set of selected) inversions immediately ﬂanked by
deletions. Since independent inversion and indel(s) at exactly the same site
are much less likely considering the close evolutionary relationship between
human and chimpanzee, the results suggest that a sequence gain or loss is
likely to accompany an inversion.

2.2 Detection of pico-inplace-inversions

The results of micro-inversions help us to design an approach to detect
pico-inversions: the number of micro-inversions gives an initial estimate
of inversion rate between two species. Also, the prevalent existence of gaps
on ﬂanking sites of inversions suggests that a potential inversion and gap(s)
immediately adjacent to it should be considered a single event instead of
multiple independent events. Since pico-inversions are too short to form
signiﬁcant alignments, the approaches used in identifying micro-inversions
do not apply here. We use probability analysis to detect them.

In the rest of this section, we ﬁrst describe the probability model
to determine a pico-inversion, then present the approach to detect pico-
inversions genome-wide, and ﬁnally analyze the time complexity of the
pipeline.

2.2.1 The probability model to determine a pica-inversion For an
alignment block containing a potential pico-inversion, we use Porig and
Pinv to denote the probabilities of evolutionary events given the original
alignment and the alignment with the inversion corrected, respectively. We
use a likelihood ratio test between Porig and Pinv to draw a conclusion about
the inversion.

In our models, the substitution rates affect the detection of pico-inversions
greatly. We cannot simply assume the independence of substitutions in
this study since it causes signiﬁcant bias toward more false positive pico-
inversions. We call a segment of i contiguous substitutions (where two
ﬂanking positions are matches) a substitution block (of length i), which is
considered a single categorical event outcome, and use pi to denote the
probability of such event at any position in the genome. The longest run
of substitutions in humanichimpanzee chain-net alignment has 20 bases.
Therefore, we consider pi’s up to p20. p0 corresponds to the probability
of no change (e.g. match) at a position. Let pgap denote the probability of
starting a gap at any position in the genome. Let C, and Cgap be the counts
of substitution blocks (of length i) and gaps (regardless of length) in the
whole genome alignment, respectively. C0 is the count of matches. leal 2
 Ci+Cgap. Let pizCi/leal and pgapogap/leal be the maximum
likelihood estimates ofpi and pgap, respectively. When C, is 0, 13,»: 1 /leal.
We then have 13021—21221 13,»— ﬁgap. Representative values of pi’s and
ﬁgap are shown in Table 2 under iteration 0. We notice that ﬁ,»(‘>1)>>ﬁ'l
(the probability of i contiguous substitutions assuming their independence),
which veriﬁes the non-independence of substitutions.

For the null model, we consider that in an alignment block M ,
matches, substitution blocks and gaps follow a categorical distribution where
p=(po,p1,...,p20,pgap). We then have

where x0, xi’s (i > 0) and xgap are the counts of matches, substitution blocks
of length i and gaps in M , respectively. With a maximum likelihood estimate,
we get

Let pinv denote the probability of having an inplace-inversion (of any
length) at any position in the genome. For the alternative model, we
consider that matches, substitution blocks, gaps and inplace-inversion(s)
follow a categorical distribution where p’ =(pf),p’l , p’20,péap,pinv). After
the inversion sequence is replaced with its reverse complement in an
alignment block M , the new optimum alignment becomes M ’ . Let IN V denote
an inversion event. We now have

2.2.2 Detection of genome-wide pico- inversions To look for genome-
wide pico-inversions, we scan the chain-net alignment. Every alignment
block B has two sequences, one from human and one from chimpanzee.
Note that the inversion could have occurred in either species, but we do not
intend to differentiate the two cases at this stage. We simply assume that the
inversion occurred in the second sequence in an alignment, which does not
affect detecting the locations of inversions between two species. For every
ﬁve bases of the second sequence (call this segment of bases the query and
the segment of the ﬁrst sequence aligned to the query the query counterpart),
we look for a subsequence in the ﬁrst sequence that is identical to the reverse
complement of the query. Such a pair is called a reverse hit. Since we are
looking for inplace-inversions, we restrict this search within a range (e.g. 20

bases to the left and right sides of the query counterpart). Next, we compute
the highest scoring gapless extension of the hit (using the ﬁrst sequence
and the reverse complement of the second sequence), allowing at most two
mismatches. The reasoning for these criteria (i.e. gapless and at most two
mismatches) is that we are looking for pico-inversions that are typically
<30 bases. Given the low rates of mismatches and gaps between human and
chimpanzee (shown in Table 2), the chance of having a gap, or more than
two mismatches, within 30 bases is slim. Let s1 denote the segment of the
ﬁrst sequence in this extended inversion alignment. Let s; and s’2 denote the
segments of the second sequence aligned to s1 in the original alignment and
the inversion alignment, respectively. Figure 3 illustrates the notations used
here. Note that s’2 is part of the original sequence, not inverted. s2 and s’2 may
be the same, which may indicate an inversion without any gain or loss of
bases. In most cases, even when s2 and s’2 are not the same, they overlap. Let
M be the subalignment from B that covers s2 and s’2 with ﬂanking regions
fL and ﬁg on both sides (e.g. of 20 bases). M aligns squ and seq2, and it
contains the potential pico-inversion.

Note that the inversion alignment found above (s1 versus the reverse
complement of s’z) may be overextended from the real inversion. We then
search the subsequences of s’2 to determine the best potential inversion in M.

For every subsequence s}, of at least ﬁve bases in s’z, s}, in seq2 is replaced
by its reverse complement s; to form seq2’ . M ’ denotes the global alignment
between squ and seq2’ under the restriction that no gap is allowed in s;,,
because we do not allow a gap inside a pico-inversion. sme denotes the
s}, whose M ’ has the highest Pm, and its alignment is Mr’nax. sme (or the
segment in the ﬁrst sequence aligned to sbmax) may be a potential pico-
inversion. We then compute Porig using M and compare it with Pinv of Mr’nax.
If Pm <<l30rig (e.g. Pinv /130rig <0.01), it means that this potential inversion
most likely will not pass the subsequent likelihood ratio tests and is discarded.

The concern of non-orthologous alignment in detecting pico-inversions is
the same as in detecting micro-inversions. With the observation that spurious
alignments usually have higher rates of mismatches and gaps, we enforce two
criteria to exclude false positive pico-inversions. First, supposing there are
m mismatches in MI’nax where there are n aligned positions, the probability
of having at least m mismatches in n positions must be less than a threshold
th (e.g. 1%). For simplicity, we assume mismatches are independent and
use binomial distribution here. Second, supposing there are g gaps in MI’nax
(excluding the ones considered part of the inversion event as explained
before), the probability of having at least g gaps in n positions must also be
less than th. When a gap is allowed to exist, its length must be within Lgap
bases (e.g. ﬁve bases, since most gaps are within ﬁve bases observed from
the whole genome alignment). th and Lgap are referred to as orthologous
thresholds.

The above steps produce a set of potential pico-inversions. For each
potential pico-inversion, we conduct the likelihood ratio test deﬁned in
Formula (3). If the likelihood ratio is greater than a threshold T, the
pico-inversion is reported. After the ﬁrst iteration, a certain number of pico-
inversions are determined. For example, when T = 6.64 [which corresponds
to 1% signiﬁcance level of X2(1)], the count is 1986. This count shows
that our initial 13,“, (based on the count of micro-inversions) was an
underestimate. We then update 13,“, using the new number of inversions.
At the same time, some substitution blocks and gaps are found to be caused
by inversions, and the values of 13,».  ﬁgap and ﬁéap are updated accordingly.
Using the updated rates, we rescan the set of the potential pico-inversions.
For example, when T = 6.64, the second iteration produces 4129 pico-
inversions. We iteratively update the parameters from the newly discovered
inversions and rescan the set of potential pico-inversions until the number
of determined inversions stabilizes (i.e. 13m, converges), which takes several
iterations.

2.2.3 Time complexity of PicolnversionMiner The above steps are
summarized in Figure 4. There are two major components in
PicolnversionMiner. The ﬁrst component (ScanPotentialPicoInversions)
linearly scans the whole genome alignment and obtains the set of potential
pico-inversions I . The second component (lines 379 in PicolnversionMiner
in Fig. 4) iteratively scans I , conducts a likelihood ratio test for each
potential pico-inversion and updates parameters until the count of pico-
inversions stabilizes. We can analyze the time complexity separately on
these two components. Supposing x is a sequence, |x| denotes the length
of x. Supposing X is a set, |X| denotes the number of elements in X. For
the ﬁrst component, the most time-expensive step is at line 16, the global
alignment between squ and squ Based on this step and assuming the
sizes of s’z, squ and squ are the same for all hits, the time complexity
of this component is 0((ZlHil) >< |s’2| >< |seq1| >< |seq’2|), where H, is the set
of reverse hits in an alignment block, and ZlHil is the total number of
reverse hits in the genome. Since |seq1| (and |seq’2|) is 2|s’2|+U”L|+U€R|,
the time complexity of the ﬁrst component is therefore 0(ZlHil >< |s’2|3).
The time complexity for the second component is 0(K >< |I|) where K is
the number of iterations. Since |I| < Z |H,»| and K <<|s’2|3, the overall time
complexity of PicolnversionMiner is 0(2 |H,»| >< |s’2|3). The typical size of s’2
is at most dozens of bases. Since we restrict the reverse hits to be close to the
alignment diagonal (Fig. 3), the total number of reverse hits is largely linear
to the genome size. The running time measured in CPU time is described in
Section 3.2.

3 RESULTS

We used hg19-panTro3 chain-net alignment from the browser to
detect both micro- and pico-inplace-inversions between human
and chimpanzee. Here we present the results and analyze the
basic characteristics of these inversions. For micro-inversions, we
compared our result with the result of Chaisson et (11. (2006). For
pico-inversions, we conducted a preliminary veriﬁcation based on
out-group information.

3.1 Micro-inplace-inversions

Table 1 shows the counts of different types of micro-inplace-
inversions between human and chimpanzee. We see that the counts
depend on the threshold of the distance from the inversion to its
ﬂanking alignment blocks. The shorter the distance threshold, the

more signiﬁcant evidence that the inversion is inplace. Note that
because Type III inversions are the ones found inside alignment
blocks, they are all surrounded by nearby alignments (from the same
alignment block). Therefore, the counts of Type III inversions are
the same for different distance thresholds. We take the value of 425
to compute the initial 131,“, since this count is the most consistent
with what was reported in Chaisson et (11. (2006). Figure 5 shows
the length distribution of micro-inplace-inversions that are shorter
than 400 bases. It is obvious from the plot that shorter inversions
have higher frequencies in general, which also implies the existence
and prevalence of pico-inversions.

We performed a preliminary comparison of these inversions with
the of Chaisson et (11. (2006). Of the 426 inversions detected by
Chaisson et (11. (2006), 424 were converted from hg17 to hg19 by
liftOver from the browser. Assume two inversions from two studies
are consistent if their human sequences overlap. Among the result of
Chaisson et (11. (2006), 194 inversions are consistent with the Type
I inversions, 17 with the Type II inversions and none with the Type
III inversions. Therefore, about 50% of inversions from Chaisson
et (11. (2006) are found in our study. We took a closer look at the
rest that were not found in our study. Among these, 45 inversions’
human sequences are aligned in hg19-panTro3 chain-net with <25%
of their lengths, and 147 inversions’ human sequences are aligned
to the positive strand of chimpanzee in hg19-panTro3 chain-net;
this indicates that the discrepancies on these inversions are largely
due to the assembly and alignment differences. The remaining 21
inversions are not reported in our study either because there are
nearby rearrangements (and the inversions are determined not to be
inplace in our study) or because their PIPs are <95% (which is a
criterion of orthologous alignment speciﬁed in Section 2.1).

Values for iteration 0 are computed from the chain-net alignment. Values for other
iterations are updated using newly found inversions from the last iteration. The count
of pico-inversions obtained in the sixth iteration is the same as the one in the ﬁfth
iteration.

X2(1) signiﬁcance level of 0.01 and the orthologous thresholds
of Porth=0.01 and Lgap=5 (these are the default thresholds in
PicoInversionMiner). It takes ﬁve iterations of parameter updating
for 131,“, to stabilize. An example of the parameter updating process
is recorded in Table 2. We see that most parameters excluding 131,“,
do not change signiﬁcantly after each iteration. Given the whole
genome alignment between human and chimpanzee, the complete
process takes ~2.5 h of CPU time on a regular desktop. The counts of
pico-inversions found by PicoInversionMiner are reported in Table 3
with different signiﬁcance thresholds and orthologous thresholds.

Using the default thresholds, 6007 inversions are found by
PicoInversionMiner. The shortest has ﬁve bases (because of the
query size in PicoInversionMiner), and the longest has 154 bases.
Among these, 5946 are pico-inversions (i.e. 340 bases). The
frequencies of the lengths of these pico-inversions follow an
exponential distribution f (x): 1617.2>< 0.861)‘ with the goodness
of ﬁt R2=0.96. We will show by the simulations (in Section 4)
that the accuracy of the prediction of pico-inversions is related to
the length of pico-inversions. In general, shorter predicated pico-
inversions have higher false positive rates. Therefore, we summarize
the counts and properties of pico-inversions considering different
minimum lengths in Table 4.

In this table, ‘frequency distribution’ refers to the frequency distribution of the lengths
of pico-inversions; R2 refers to the goodness of ﬁt of the distribution function; ‘repeats’
refers to the simple repeats and homopolymers; ‘IR’ refers to a pair of sequences that
are inverted repeats.

3The ﬁrst number refers to the minimum length of each sequence of the IR; the second
number (in the parentheses) refers to the maximum number of mismatches between the
pair of sequences of the IR.

Many of the discovered pico-inversions are simple repeats or
homopolymers (a sequence of identical bases). Since the techniques
of sequencing, assembling and aligning these sequences are less
reliable, the predication of inversions in these sequences is also
less reliable. We examined each pico-inversion whether it is
homopolymer (if the inversion’s human or chimpanzee sequence
is homopolymer) and whether it is simple repeat (if the inversion’s
human sequence overlaps an entry in the simple repeat annotation
of hg19). Among the 5946 pico-inversions of a minimum length
of ﬁve bases, 4351 are not homopolymers or simple repeats. The
frequency distribution of the lengths of these inversions becomes
f(x)= 1401.8 x 0.844)“ with R2 =0.94.

It has been proposed that inverted repeats (IR) [a pair of adjacent
or nearby sequences where one is the reverse complement of the
other] mediate inversions (Kolb et al., 2009; Small et al., 1997).
Many of the discovered pico-inversions are associated with IR: the
ﬂanking sites of the inversion are IR, the inversion overlaps IR or the
inversion is surrounded by nearby IR (e.g. within a distance of 20
bases from the inversion). Among the above 4351 pico-inversions
that are not homopolymers or simple repeats, 46.3% are associated
with an IR of at least six bases that are perfect matches, 20.5%
are associated with an IR of at least 10 bases that have at most

subﬁgure, the bottom panel is the original alignment of human, chimpanzee
and gorilla (in this order) from the browser. Gorilla is used as the out-group
in these examples. Small circles indicate substitutions based on the original
alignment with the out-group. The sequences above wide arrows are ancestral
human sequences after the species split between human and chimpanzee.
Rectangular boxes indicate inversions. (a) An inversion in 5’ UTR of CD180.
The inversion starts at chr5:66,492,476, which is just several bases away from
the translation start position. The subsequence in shade in the box is lost due
to the inversion. (b) An inversion in 5’ UTR of SPRYl. The inversion starts
at chr4:124,317,977. The circle in the top sequence indicates a substitution
in the ancestral human sequence, which leads to the perfect match of a pair
of inverted repeats indicated by the solid arrows. The inversion occurred just
between this pair. (c) An inversion in 3’ UTR of c70rf41. The inversion starts
at chr7:30,201,616. The reverse complement of an 18-base DNA fragment
underlined in the top sequence is inserted in the ancestral human sequence,
and leads to the perfect match of a pair of inverted repeats of 23 bases. The
inversion occurred just between this pair.

one substitution in the IR and 6.7% are associated with an IR of at
least 14 bases that have at most two substitutions in the IR. Table 4
shows more details about the percentages of pico-inversions that
are associated with IR considering different minimum lengths of
pico-inversions.

We are also interested in the association of pico-inversions with
gene annotations. Among the above 4351 pico-inversions that are
not homopolymers or simple repeats, 39.6% are in gene regions,
and 1.0% are in exons. There is only one pico-inversion found in a
coding region, which belongs to a suggested pseudo-gene. Figure 6
shows several representative examples of pico-inversions in human
exons: an inversion without a sequence gain or loss, an inversion
with a sequence 10s, and an inversion with a sequence gain. The
results considering different minimum lengths of pico-inversions
are summarized in Table 4.

We conducted a preliminary veriﬁcation of the pico-inversions
found between human and chimpanzee using gorilla (or orangutan,

‘Repetitive’ refers to inversions that are homopolymers or simple repeats. The columns
of ‘human’ and ‘chimpanzee’ record the numbers of inversions within human lineage
and chimpanzee lineage, respectively. ‘No support’ indicates that there is no evidence
of inversion in either species based on the out-group. ‘No out-group’ indicates that there
is no gorilla or orangutan sequence aligned to the human sequence of the inversion in
the 46-way alignment. ‘Partial alignment’ indicates that the inversion is not completely
contained inside an alignment block from the 46-way alignment.

in cases where the gorilla sequence does not exist) as an out-
group. The assumption is that if an inversion is real and has
occurred in a certain lineage, the alignment between the sequence
of this lineage and its out-group must be worse than the alignment
between the sequence with the inversion corrected and its out-
group. Let Ah, A2, AC and A’C denote the scores of the global
alignments between the out-group and the original human sequence,
the corrected human sequence, the original chimpanzee sequence
and the corrected chimpanzee sequence, respectively. If Ah <Ajl
and AC >A’C, we conclude that the inversion occurred in the human
lineage. If Ah >Ajl and AC <A’C, we conclude that the inversion
occurred in the chimpanzee lineage. For other cases, we conclude
that there is no evidence of an inversion based on the out-group
information, and the reported inversion is a false positive. For the
above global alignments, ﬂanking positions (e.g. up to 20 bases)
of the inversion are also included in the alignment computation to
ensure the alignment accuracy. The gorilla and orangutan sequences
are taken from the 46-way Multiz alignment from the browser. The
analysis results are recorded in Table 5. Among the 4351 inversions
that are not homopolymers or simple repeats, 352 are not aligned
to gorilla or orangutan (and they are considered to have no out-
group), and 222 are not completely contained inside alignment
blocks that possess an out-group; these inversions are excluded
from the analysis. Out of the remaining 3777 inversions, 617 are
determined to be false positives. Therefore, the false positive rate of
detecting inversions that are not repetitive sequences is 617 / (1246+
1914 + 617) = 16.3%. The analysis results of pico-inversions that are
repetitive sequences are also shown in Table 5, and the false positive
rate is much higher at 413/(253+376+413)=39.6%. Note that in
this analysis, the number of inversions in chimpanzee is much higher
than the number in human. This might be related to the fact that the
sequencing quality of chimpanzee genome is not as good as the
quality of human genome, and PicoInversionMiner is sensitive to
substitutions and short indels in the alignment that may be caused
by sequencing errors.

SIMULATION

To systematically evaluate the accuracy of PicoInversionMiner,
we apply it on simulated genomic sequences and compute its

and speciﬁcity (the percentage of detected inversions that are true

inversions). We use the shortest human chromosome, #21, as the
starting sequence (so that repeats and duplications already exist)
to simulate substitution blocks, indels and pico-inversions. The
models of substitution blocks and indels are obtained from the whole
genome alignment between human and chimpanzee. The model of
pico-inversions is obtained from the pico-inversions discovered by
PicoInversionMiner based on the whole genome alignment between
human and chimpanzee. We then use BLASTZ to align the simulated
sequences.

pgap ~N(Pgapt\/ W) and pinv ~N(IA7invt\/ 
(where n is the genome size). For each simulation, we sample
pi’s (i>0), pgap and pinv from these normal distributions. The
locations of mutational events are assumed to be uniformly
distributed on the sequences. For each nucleotide substitution,
the chances of transition and transversion are set to be 66.7 and
33.3%, respectively, since the ratio between the two is 2:1 as
observed from the whole genome alignment between human and
chimpanzee. The frequencies of indel lengths follow the power-law
distribution f(x)=6182215.07x-2-23 with the goodness of ﬁt
R2=0.98 obtained from the whole genome alignment between
human and chimpanzee. We then sample indel lengths from their
distribution ﬁlnction f(x)=1—x_1‘23 (and then round down to
the nearest integer). Note that there is no difference between
insertion and deletion when only two species are considered
without an out-group. Therefore, we simulated deletions for all
indels for simplicity. The frequencies of inversion lengths follow
the exponential distribution f (x) = 1617.2 x 0.861)‘ that we obtained
earlier, and we sample inversion lengths from their distribution

integer) assuming the shortest inversion has ﬁve bases. In each
sequence of n bases, we simulate 0.5npgap indels and 05an1‘]
inversions assuming each species evolves at the same rate.

We then align two sequences using BLASTZ (with default
parameters). Since there are many duplications originated from
chromosome #21, we use single_cov2 program from the
TBA/Multiz package (Blanchette et al., 2004) to post-process
BLASTZ output to make sure any human position is aligned
to chimpanzee at most once (i.e. a sequence segment in human
is aligned to only one copy in chimpanzee, instead of multiple
homologous copies in chimpanzee). Single_cov2 is used in the place
of chain-net, because it eliminates non-orthologous homologous

alignments caused by duplications similarly to chain-net, and we
did not ﬁnd a stand-alone public application that created chain-net
alignments.

A total of 100 pairs of sequences are produced. The average length
of each sequence is ~48.0M bases. The details of the comparison
between simulation data and real data are shown in Table 6. Note
that the sequences are generated by the simulator according to the
models trained from the real data of the whole genome alignment.
Therefore, the frequencies of the simulated events in the simulated
sequences are very consistent with the real data, but the values
computed from the alignments of these sequences show some
differences from the real data. The alignment between the simulated
sequences actually shows slightly higher species divergence than
the divergence between human and chimpanzee observed from the
whole genome alignment.

Figure 7a shows sensitivity versus 1—speciﬁcity of
PicoInversionMiner applied to these simulated sequences. When
considering all inversions (shown in Fig. 7b with a minimum length
of ﬁve bases), the sensitivity is moderate, and the speciﬁcity is very

high (i.e. >95%) except for several cases where the T threshold
is not strict. A less strict T produces higher sensitivity and lower
speciﬁcity. The best balance between sensitivity and speciﬁcity is
achieved at the T value that corresponds to X2(1) signiﬁcance level
of 0.075. When considering larger pico-inversions only (e.g. 310
or 315 bases), the sensitivity is high (e.g. >80%) with even higher
speciﬁcity. We discuss the reasons for low sensitivity on very small
pico-inversions in Section 5.

For the control experiment, we also simulated 100 pairs of
sequences using the same substitution and indel models from the
same starting sequence, but without simulating pico-inversions,
and applied PicoInversionMiner to the alignments between these
sequences with default thresholds [T corresponding to X2(1)
signiﬁcance of 0.01]. The discovered inversions are then all false
positives. The number of these (false positive) pico-inversions (of
minimum length of ﬁve bases) ranges from 0 to 5 with an average
of only 1.1 inversions per pair of sequences. This number of
false positives is actually less than the number of false positives
discovered between sequences with pico-inversions simulated. For
the 100 pairs of sequences with inversions simulated, the number
of simulated inversions ranges from 110 to 117 with an average
of 112.9, the number of discovered (pico-)inversions ranges from
44 to 77 with an average of 62.8 (with default thresholds) and the
number of false positives ranges from 0 to 6 with an average of 1.8
(which leads to the speciﬁcity of 97.5%). This fact is related to the
algorithm of PicoInversionMiner. The algorithm starts from an initial
estimate of the inversion rate Pinv, which is based on the number of
micro-inversions between human and chimpanzee, and iteratively
updates it with newly discovered (pico-)inversions. The higher the
value of Pinv, the more potential pico-inversions pass the likelihood
ratio test and are determined to be pico-inversions; therefore, there
is a higher chance of producing false positives. The iteration stops
when there is no increase of Pinv. The initial estimate of Pinv is
very low. When there are no inversions simulated, the number of
pico-inversions discovered by this rate is also very low, and the
iteration stops after one or two cycles. However, for the sequences
with inversions simulated, the number of pico-inversions discovered
in the ﬁrst iteration raises the value of Pinv signiﬁcantly, and there
are more iterations, which leads to more false positives. Note that for
the simulations, the value of Cim-t in Figure 4 is calculated based on
the initial estimate of 131m, and the length of the simulated sequence:
1.63 ><10_7 ><48M2 8.

Though PicoInversionMiner is designed to detect pico-inversions
between human and chimpanzee, we would like to test its
effectiveness on more diverged sequences. To simulate sequences
of different divergences, we assume that the rates of substitution
blocks, indels and inversions are constant. For example, if two
sequences’ p1 is 0.06, which is around ﬁve times greater than the p1
between human and chimpanzee (call this value coefﬁcient c), their
other pi’s (i > 1), pgap and pinv are also ﬁve times greater than the
rates between human and chimpanzee. We then can use different c
values to simulate sequences at different divergences. When c: 1,
the divergence is between human and chimpanzee, where the PIP
is 98.7%; when c=7.5, the PIP becomes ~90%. However, we use
the same length distributions of indels and pico-inversions from the
above human—chimpanzee simulation for simplicity.

Figure 7b shows sensitivity versus 1—speciﬁcity of
PicoInversionMiner applied to simulated sequences of different c
values. In all, 100 pairs of sequences are produced for each c value.

When sequences are diverged, the sensitivity of detecting very
small pico-inversions is very low. Therefore, only inversions no
shorter than 10 bases are considered here. For nearly all cases, the
speciﬁcity is very high (>97%). The sensitivity is acceptable (e.g.
>50%) when c345, which corresponds to a PIP of 94%. We can
also observe that after T reaches the value corresponding to X2(1)
signiﬁcance level of 0.1, a less strict T value does not improve
sensitivity much. Therefore, PicoInversionMiner is only effective
for very similar sequences.

5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

We see that the sensitivity of PicoInversionMiner in detecting very
small pico-inversions is low. Actually, many small inversions are
simply not detectable by any means. For example, the reverse
complement of ‘CAATG’ is ‘CATTG’, and their alignment only
contains one mismatch. It is impossible to distinguish the inversion
event from the substitution event in this case.

There are also some cases where the inversion is not detectable
due to the limitations of the model used by PicoInversionMiner. For
example, suppose that there is a ﬁve-base inversion in human and
suppose that its alignment with chimpanzee shows a substitution
block of ﬁve bases. Using values from Table 2 iteration 5,

we have out]? =2ln((2.44 ><10_6 >< 0.9865)/(1.57 ><10_6))=

0.74, which is rigt signiﬁcant enough to conclude an inversion.
Note that the rates of substitution blocks are computed from the
whole genome alignment, which also includes spurious alignments
(Prakash and Tompa, 2007) and non-orthologous homologous
alignments. Therefore, the rates of substitution blocks (especially
the large ones) are very likely elevated. When a better quality
alignment is available, the substitution block rates can be corrected
(and most likely be reduced), and some potential pico-inversions,
whose likelihood ratio tests were not signiﬁcant enough before, may
be rediscovered.

We have explained that the shortest signiﬁcant alignment between
human and chimpanzee is around 30~33 bases assuming there
are no mismatches or gaps. When there are mismatches or gaps,
which is more common between more diverged species, the shortest
signiﬁcant alignment is longer. We deﬁned pico-inversions as the
ones too small to be detected by the aligner. Therefore, there is
no clear distinction between the shortest micro-inversion and the
longest pico-inversion. We arbitrarily chose 40 bases as the largest
size of pico-inversions in this article.

All inversions discovered in this article are inplace ones. It
may be noted that there are micro-inversions that are transposed
to different genomic regions. It can be conjectured that there
are also pico-inversions that are transposed. However, there lack
studies on micro-inversions that are transposed, partly due to the
assembly and alignment challenges. It is even more difﬁcult to detect
pico-inversions that are transposed. This can be a ﬁlture work.

Although we tried to simulate genomic sequences as similar to the
real sequences as possible based on the properties of substitution
blocks, indels and inversions obtained from the whole genome
alignment, the simulation cannot perfectly present the real situation.
For example, the simulation assumed uniform distribution of the
evolutionary events, which is too simpliﬁed and may cause bias
in the evaluation results. We presented a preliminary approach (by
using an out-group) to verify pico-inversions between human and

chimpanzee. The false positive rate based on out-group information
indicates that the speciﬁcities computed from the simulations may
be elevated. It is a ﬁlture work to develop more advanced methods
to verify the pico-inversions and evaluate the tool.

In summary, inversions are important genomic mutations.
However, very small inversions have been ignored for a long
time partly due to the technical limitation in sequence alignment
methodologies. This study veriﬁed the existence of inversions as
short as several bases and estimated that there are at least thousands
of very small inversions between human and chimpanzee. Detection
of such events not only provides a more complete picture of
genome evolution, but also helps improve alignment quality (by
correcting wrong alignments caused by inversions) and facilitates
any downstream data analyses based on alignments. We also
presented the software tool PicoInversionMiner, which is effective
in detecting pico-inversions between very similar sequences. To ﬁnd
very small inversions between more diverged sequences, we need
to explore more sophisticated methods.

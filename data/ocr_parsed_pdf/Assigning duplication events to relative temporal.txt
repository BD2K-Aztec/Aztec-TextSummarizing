ABSTRACT

Motivation: ln genome-wide analyses, the relative age of gene
duplications is often estimated by measuring the rate of synonymous
substitutions (dS) between paralogous sequences. On the other
hand, recent studies have shown the feasibility of inferring, at
genomic scales, the relative age of duplication events from the
topology of gene family trees. This represents a promising alternative
for large surveys requiring an automatic methodology to establish a
timeline of duplication events and that are usually limited to the use
of dS, which presents known limitations such as a fast saturation of
the signal. However, both measures have never been compared in a
common framework.

Results: Topology-based placement of duplications on a relative
time scale corresponding to periods between speciation events were
found to be highly consistent, providing the same placement for
67—84% of a reliable set of gene pairs duplicated in a single event. For
recent evolutionary periods, dS and topological measures showed a
strong correlation. We conclude that the topology-based approach
is more appropriate for assigning duplications to temporal scales
when analyses need to include ancient events, and that the study
of recent duplications may benefit from a combination of dS and
topology information.

1 INTRODUCTION

The level of sequence divergence between two related
protein-coding genes can be expressed as the corrected number of
residue substitutions occurring at the level of their DNA sequences.
These substitutions can be classiﬁed as non-synonymous or
synonymous depending on whether the nucleotide change results in
a amino acid substitution in the encoded protein. Since synonymous
substitutions are considered relatively free of selective pressures,
at least at the protein level, these are often assumed to accumulate
with time in a linear fashion that depends on the species generation
time and mutation rates. Accordingly, the rate of synonymous

substitutions between two sequences (dS) is extensively used as a
proxy for their relative divergence time.

In the particular case of genes that diverged through duplication
(paralogs), dS is often used as an estimator for the relative age of
the duplication event (i.e. to ascertain which duplications are more
recent or ancient with respect to the others, without necessarily
assigning a speciﬁc date for the duplication). Many recent studies
have used this methodology to address the evolution of duplicate
genes at a genomic scale (Chung et (11., 2006; Gu et (11., 2002;
Li et (11., 2005; Liao and Zhang, 2006; Makova and Li, 2003).
However, in such studies, the central assumption that dS increments
linearly with time in the ranges considered is never tested, possibly
due to a lack of appropriate benchmarks. Most importantly, a
signiﬁcant number of the detected duplications are discarded due
to saturated dS values, usually applying a threshold that is set
around dS> 1.5. It must be noted that all these studies were well
aware of the effects of dS saturation, and therefore this measure
was applied within appropriate limits. However, the implications
that the possible sampling effect may have in the generality of their
conclusions are usually not discussed. The effect of dS saturation
has been described earlier (Gojobori, 1983) and constitutes one of
the main known limitations of this methodology. Additionally, other
necessary assumptions, such as the existence of a molecular clock
or the absence of selection at synonymous sites, have been shown
to be often violated (Gao and Innan, 2004; Resch et (11., 2007).
In the light of such caveats, alternative methods, such as assigning
duplication events to a relative temporal scale based on the topology
of phylogenetic trees, may prove more adequate. Here, we will refer
to this methodology as phylogeny-based relative dating.

Phylogeny-based relative dating uses the species relationships
determined by the gene tree topology to locate speciation and
duplication events. This can be done by using a more or less
sophisticated algorithm to reconcile the gene tree with a known
species tree (see, for instance, Akerborg et (11., 2009; Chen et (11.,
2000; Storm and Sonnhammer, 2002) or, alternatively, by simply
detecting overlaps in the species content between the daughter
branches of a given tree node (Huerta-Cepas et (11., 2007; Vilella
et (11., 2009). In either approach, the relative age of each duplication
is subsequently inferred according to the species found in the
post-duplication branches of the tree. This is, considering that a
duplication event should have preceded all speciations found in more
recent branches, such event is assumed to have occurred prior to the
most ancient of the subsequent speciation events.

In contrast to dS, phylogeny-based relative dating does not
provide a continuous scale of time but it only assigns duplications

Temporal scales in duplications

 

to discrete categories. Such categories will depend on the number
of lineages included in the gene phylogeny and will deﬁne the
precision of the relative time estimates. Thus, for most of the
cases, and especially when taxonomic sampling is sparse, the level
of resolution of dS is expected to be much higher. Moreover,
the categories established by phylogeny-based relative dating
correspond to intervals between speciation events for which the
temporal order is known but for which the absolute dates are
often not conﬁdently established. Thus, unless the speciﬁc date (i.e.
how many million years ago) of the speciation events is known,
phylogeny-based relative dating will provide us with a relative
temporal order of the speciation events (a chronology) rather than
a calibrated timescale. This is similar to dS-based approaches for
relative dating in genome-wide analyses, where speciﬁc substitution
rates are usually not calibrated.

One of the main advantages of phylogeny-based relative dating
is that the level of resolution obtained is that of the underlying gene
tree. Thus, since the evolutionary analysis takes into account the
information contained in a multiple sequence alignment rather than
just the two paralogs, it is expected to be less prone to saturation
than pair-wise based measures of dS. Moreover, phylogenetic
reconstruction can use amino acid sequences, which are less prone to
saturation, to reconstruct ancient events. Although for many studies
the estimation of absolute dates is necessary or desirable, many
other questions can be addressed with relative temporal scales (see,
for instance Chung et (11., 2006; Gu et (11., 2002; Liao and Zhang,
2006; Makova and Li, 2003). Note that, besides the need for reliable
calibrating points, the computation of absolute dates is usually
associated with large computational times. For instance, performing
an absolute dating with BEAST (Drummond and Rambaut, 2007)
on a precomputed phylogeny of 100 sequences needs the order of
hours on a single processor, as compared to seconds of a relative
topological dating using ETE (Huerta-Cepas et (11., 2010).

Considering that the use of relative time scales is the norm in many
large-scale genomic analyses, we will focus here on the comparison
of relative age estimation. However, we want to stress the importance
of properly calibrating mutation rates and speciation nodes if the
aim is to provide absolute dates (or date intervals) with either dS or
phylogeny-based methods.

In summary, dS-based and phylogeny-based relative dating
provide two alternative measures of relative divergence time
between duplicates, which have so far never been compared within
a common framework.

To gain insight into the different properties of dS and phylogeny-
based relative dating, we compare here both alternatives using the
complete set of duplications detected in several eukaryotic genomes,
including human, mouse, pufferﬁsh and yeast. Our results show a
large degree of dS saturation in genome-wide analyses, which results
in a bias toward recent duplications when duplicates with dS values
over a given threshold are discarded from the analysis. This conﬁrms
and extends previous ﬁndings from analyses of reduced sets of
orthologous gene pairs in mammals (Wolfe et (11., 1989). Moreover,
we show that the phylogeny-based approach is able to detect very
ancient duplications, while within non-saturated ranges of dS, both
approaches correlate signiﬁcantly. Finally, using a reliable set of
paralogous gene pairs duplicated in a single event, we show that
phylogeny-based relative dating is highly consistent, assigning most
pairs of paralogs emerged from the same segmental duplication to
the same relative evolutionary period.

2 METHODS

2.1 Phylogenetic data

We used two independent sources of phylogenomic data: phylomeDB 3.0
(Huerta-Cepas et (11.. 2008) and Ensembl Compara v57 (Vilella et (11..
2009). In the case of phylomeDB. we used the human (Huerta-Cepas et (11..
2007) and yeast (T21) (Marcet-Houben and Gabaldon. 2009) phylomes.
considering only Maximum Likelihood trees reconstructed by the best ﬁtting
model (mtREV. JTT. WAG. Blosum62 and VT models tested). PhylomeDB
trees are based on protein sequence alignments. Human. mouse and pufferﬁsh
paralogs were also inferred from ensembl compara trees. which were
reconstructed using TreeBest and the WAG model (Vilella et (11.. 2009).
Ensembl compara trees did not provide branch-speciﬁc support values.
Branch support in PhylomeDB trees. when indicated. correspond to the
approximate likelihood ratio tests (aLRT. Minimum of SH-like and chi-
square-based option) as implemented in PhyML (aLRT version) (Anisimova
and Gascuel. 2006; Guindon and Gascuel. 2003).

2.2 Detection of paralogous adjacent pairs

Gene coordinates were obtained from Ensembl v57. Pseudogenes and non-
protein coding genes were removed from the analysis. We considered two
genes to be adjacent if they were in the same chromosome and separated
by a given number of genes (referred to as the window size threshold). Two
pairs of adjacent genes were considered to form a paralogous adjacent pair
(PAP). if adjacent genes in one pair were not homologous to each other but
both have a paralog in the second pair of adjacent genes. We used several
window size thresholds to calculate PAPs: 0. 5. 10 and 20. Meaning that 0.
5. 10 or 20 genes were allowed to exist between the two adjacent genes.

2.3 Detecting duplication events and providing a
relative dating

Relative topological ages were estimated by analyzing phylogenetic trees
and detecting the most recent common ancestor of the sequences involved
in each duplication event. For this. we scanned all gene phylogenies using a
simple species overlap approach to detect duplication events. Thus. any tree
node whose child branches overlap in at least one species was considered a
duplication. Next. the species involved in each duplication were mapped
to the NCBI taxonomy tree (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/) to
determine the ﬁrst common ancestor group. thus obtaining a relative date for
each event. A duplication mapped to a given taxonomic group is interpreted
as an event occurring. at least. before the radiation of such group of species.

The ETE toolkit (Huerta-Cepas et (11.. 2010). a Python programming
library to manipulate and analyze trees. was used to perform all tree- related
operations. Species that overlap between branches. paralogy predictions
and node labeling were performed as implemented in the ETE’s built-in
orthology and paralogy methods (default parameters). The species tree used
as a reference for relative dating was assembled according to the NCBI
taxonomy database. ETE was used to convert NCBI taxonomy information
into a hierarchical tree as well as to assign relative age labels to each
duplication node in trees.

2.4 dS calculation

dS ratios between human duplicate pairs were computed using three
alternative methods. including the codeml (ML; Goldman and Yang. 1994).
Nei-Gojobori (NG; Nei and Gojobori. 1986) and Yang-Nielsen (YN;
Yang and Nielsen. 2000). as implemented in the PAML program (Yang.
1997). The ynOO program was used for NG and YN methods. whereas
codeml (seqtype = codons. CodonFreq = F3X4. runmode = automatic) was
used for ML estimations. When a duplication node involved more than
two human paralogs (one-to-many or many-to-many paralogy relationships).
we computed only the dS between the two most similar paralogs emerging
from that duplication. This reﬂects best the situation in other studies where
duplications are detected as blast hits in the genome.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Saturation in dS estimates severely limits the scope
of genome-wide studies

To evaluate the effect of dS saturation at genome-wide scale, we
computed this value for all pairs of duplicated genes detected in
several eukaryotic genomes. For this, we scanned the complete
dataset of phylogenies provided for human and yeast genomes
available in phylomeDB (Huerta-Cepas et (11., 2007, 2008; Marcet-
Houben and Gabaldon, 2009) to detect duplications involving pairs
of human and yeast genes, respectively. In addition, we scanned all
family trees available at EnsemblCompara (Vilella et (11., 2009), to
detect duplications involving pairs of human, mouse and pufferﬁsh
genes. Finally, we calculated the rate of synonymous substitutions
between all the resulting paralogs pairs (see Section 2). In order
to make this analysis comparable with most previous works, we
used three different methods to calculate substitution rates, namely
YN (Yang and Nielsen, 2000), NG (Nei and Gojobori, 1986) and
ML (Goldman and Yang, 1994). In brief, these three methods are
able to estimate the number of synonymous and non-synonymous
substitutions between two homologous sequences by using various
approaches and differ, mainly, in the way in which they correct for
the effect of multiple substitutions occurring at the same site. ML is
considered the most accurate approach (Merchant et (11., 2007), while
YN is probably the most extended and has been shown to be superior
in some scenarios (Yang and Nielsen, 2000). Nevertheless, all these
methods share the problem of the saturation of the signal when very
distant sequences are compared. Rate saturation is understood as the
threshold above which multiple substitutions at the same position
can obscure the reliability of dS or dN estimates. Although different
rate saturation thresholds may be applied in different studies, we
have found that thresholds set around dS > 1.5 are the most common
in genome-wide studies of gene duplicates. Our results show a
drastic effect of setting this threshold on any of the different methods
considered (Table 1). Indeed, in the species examined, from 48%
to 89% of the detected duplicated gene pairs have saturated rates
(dS > 1.5) depending on the genome and dS calculation method.
Consequently, dS-based relative dating would be only possible for
a small subset of such paralogs. Very similar values were obtained
when a very relaxed saturation cut-off (dS > 2.0) was applied (data
not shown).

3.2 dS-based versus phylogeny-based relative dating

Recent studies have shown the feasibility of applying high-quality
phylogenetic reconstruction at genomic scale. As a consequence,
several public repositories [i.e. PhylomeDB (Huerta-Cepas et (11.,

2008) or Ensembl (Vilella et (11., 2009)] do exist that provide
genome-wide collections of pre-calculated trees involving many
model species. Besides their obvious usefulness, such trees can
be used to quickly obtain a chronology of all duplication events
occurring in a given genome, thus providing an independent
alternative to the use of dS for relative dating. In this respect,
a common and affordable strategy consists of searching for all
duplication nodes in a given set of trees and assign them to the oldest
taxonomic group represented in each node’s daughter partitions.
This, in turn, assumes that duplications occurred, at least, before
all speciation events they precede. In our analyses, we used a
simple species overlap strategy to detect duplication events and the
NCBI taxonomy tree to deﬁne different relative age categories (see
Section 2 for details).

To compare this strategy with that of dS, we analyzed all the
phylogenetic trees from which the previously used duplications were
detected. This provided us with alternative relative age estimates,
completely independent of dS, for all paralogs considered.

Interestingly, topological measures were able to consistently
track very ancient duplications. Indeed, in most cases, the relative
evolutionary period provided by the topological approach was
consistent with the most parsimonius explanation of the distribution
and number of gene family members across the genomes studied
(data not shown). Several examples are shown in the trees
in Figures 1 and 3B, which include two ancient duplications
(vertebrates and mammals, respectively). The ability of phylogeny-
based relative dating to consistently track ancient duplications is also
supported by the fact that a peak of duplications is detected at the
base of vertebrates, as expected from the whole-genome duplication
occurred in this lineage. Moreover, the sets of duplicated genes are
enriched in functions related to the evolutionary innovations at the
periods in which they are dated (Huerta-Cepas et (11., 2007).

The comparison of both measures (Fig. 2) shows that only recent
evolutionary periods are not signiﬁcantly affected by the saturation
of dS values. This corresponds to duplications that occurred during
the radiation of placental mammals in the case of human and
mouse, after the separation of Saccharomyces krudiazevi in the
case of yeast, and after the radiation of puffers in the case of
the pufferﬁsh. We believe that these periods set the limits beyond
which the use of dS-based dating is not appropriate. Furthermore,
we observed a large overlap among the distribution of dS values
of genes topologically mapped to different evolutionary periods
(Fig. 2). As expected, this effect is more pronounced in the
evolutionary periods that are more affected by dS saturation. Within
the non-saturated range of dS values, both strategies correlate
signiﬁcantly (R = 0.76; R = 0.77; R = 0.84; R = 0.64 and R = 0.79 for
human ensembl, human PhylomeDB, mouse ensembl, pufferﬁsh
ensembl and yeast PhylomeDB datasets, respectively). In all cases
P < 1.0E-200, indicating that both measures provide relatively
similar estimates. Some exceptions to this correlation were found
in ensembl trees at nodes where the presence of low-coverage
genomes may have misled phylogenetic analyses (Milinkovitch
et (11., 2010). This suggests that, within non-saturated ranges, and
in the presence of low-coverage genomes, dS estimates present
an advantage over phylogeny-based relative dating. However, even
within non-saturated ranges of dS, and using PhylomeDB trees that
contain only high-coverage genomes, we could ﬁnd many instances
in which dS dating and phylogeny-based relative dating produced
very different results. These differences were maintained even when

highly supported duplication events [approximate Likelihood Ratio
Test (aLRT) >0.85 in all three branches associated to the duplication
node] were used (see Supplementary Fig. S2). Several compelling
examples are shown in Figure 3.

3.3 Paralogous adjacent pairs suggest high accuracy
for phylogeny-based relative dating

A possible criticism of the above-mentioned comparison is that the
large level of overlap found between dS estimates of duplications
with the same phylogeny-based relative dating could result from
the lack of accuracy of the latter method. Although phylogeny-
based relative dating is increasingly being used, its reliability has
so far never been evaluated, probably due to the lack of available
gold standards with which to compare the relative age estimates
for duplicated genes. In our search for possible benchmark datasets,
we identiﬁed segmental duplications as a reliable source for pairs
of duplications that should be dated to the same event. Segmental
duplications consist of the duplication of relatively long genomic

regions that may contain more than one gene. When this occurs,
the resulting set of paralogous chromosome regions (paralogons)
will start diverging at the same time. We reasoned that such a
set of paralogous pairs, coming from the same duplication event,
represented an ideal golden set with which to benchmark methods for
dating gene duplications. Indeed, using such strategy we circumvent
the problem of establishing a true age for the duplications, since
we just need to look for coherence in the relative age estimations
of genes in a paralogon. Thus, using this benchmark, consistency
between independent relative age estimates of coupled paralogous
pairs can be used to assess the performance of different methods.
Detecting reliable cases of paralogous pairs emerged from the
same segmental duplication largely depends on the incidence of
processes such as recombination and genome re-arrangements.
Predictions of paralogons in the genomes of human and other species
have been reported (Ding et (11., 2008; McLysaght et (11., 2002).
However, a manual inspection of some of these paralogons revealed
that they were affected by large internal insertions, deletions
and genomic re-arrangements (data not shown), thus making it

tree (ML=Maximum Likelihood. YN=Yang and Nielsen. NG=Nei and
Gojorobi). (A) Phylogenetic relationship between two primate-speciﬁc taste
receptors. TAS2R9 and TAS2R8. As shown in the tree. a speciﬁc duplication
affecting only the primate lineage is detected with high support by the relative
topological dating approach. Similarly. the duplication leading to the Beta
Defensin precursors DEFB127 and DEFB128 (B) is dated to mammals by
the same method. Surprisingly. dS estimation for primate-speciﬁc TAS2R9/ 8
paralogs is higher than that of mammalian-speciﬁc DEFB127/ 128 paralogs.
Similarly. the duplication of the homeobox proteins TGIF2LX and TGIF2LY
(C) are dated by a topological approach in the human lineage. However.
their dS rate is much greater than that of the pair MRGPRX3/MRGPRX4
(D). which is a highly supported primate-speciﬁc duplication. It must be
noted that the phylogenetic distribution of the relevant paralogs in all these
cases would support the given relative topological dating. All duplication
events are supported by Maximum Likelihood analyses as implemented in
the PhylomeDB phylogenetic pipeline and by Ensembl paralogy predictions.
In the case of the human- speciﬁc duplication in tree C. further references
supporting a human-speciﬁc duplication can be found in Blanco-Arias et a1.
(2002) and Skaletsky et a1. (2003).

difﬁcult to assess whether all duplicated genes in a predicted
paralogon were resulting from the same duplication event. In order
to elaborate a high conﬁdence set of paralogous pairs originated
by the same duplication, we used very stringent thresholds for
the detection of gene order conservation. More speciﬁcally, we
searched for pairs of contiguous, non-homologous genes whose
respective paralogs can also be found adjacent in the same or a
different chromosome (Fig. 1). We refer to these cases as PAPs. The
straightforward interpretation of a PAP is that a single duplication
involved both genes in the pair. The alternative scenario, implying
that this structure results from independent duplication events, is
very unlikely, and therefore we used PAP as a golden set for pairs
emerged in a single event. We scanned the human genome and found
326 high-conﬁdence cases of PAPs (Supplementary Material).
Using the same phylogeny-based relative dating strategy
described in the previous sections, we dated each of the two
paralogous gene pairs found in every PAP. In 67% of the cases, both

Fig. 4. Accuracy of phylogeny-based topological dating of human
duplicates. Each line represents the use of different adjacency thresholds
(number of genes allowed between the syntenic pair of paralogs) to detect
PAP cases. Y—axis indicates the percentage of PAP cases for which topological
dating was consistent. that is. cases in which paralogs within a same PAP were
mapped to the same evolutionary period. X -axis represent different branch
support thresholds (aLRT support values) that is used to detect duplication
events in phylogenetic trees. The number of PAP cases at each window size
and branch support value are as follows: window size 0: 326. 254. 168. 109.
46. 29; window size 5: 1542. 1170. 694. 412. 178. 117; window size 10:
2327. 1750. 965. 558. 230. 150; and window size 20: 3504. 2566. 1401.
792. 310. 193.

paralogous gene pairs within the same PAP were correctly mapped
to the same evolutionary period. This value rose to 85% (Fig. 4)
when we used a stringent threshold for the phylogenetic support for
all the nodes deﬁning the duplication (window threshold = 0, aLRT
branch support 30.90). However, setting this threshold reduced the
benchmark dataset to only 29 PAP cases. That the accuracy of the
phylogeny-based relative dating increases with the level of branch
support threshold indicates that phylogenetic artifacts may be behind
those cases in which the phylogeny-based relative dating fails to
correctly detect concomitant duplications in PAPs. This re-assures us
in the use of PAPs as a high-conﬁdence dataset for paralogous pairs
emerged from a single duplication event. Furthermore, we explored
the effect of reducing the adjacency threshold (by allowing more
genes between syntenic genes in a PAP) in the accuracy values
of the phylogeny-based relative dating (Fig. 4). Note that a drop
in consistency scores is observed when the adjacency threshold
is relaxed, which is probably related to the existence of genomic
re-arrangements that place duplicates of different age close in the
genome. This supports the idea of using a strict adjacency threshold
in our benchmark.

Finally, we used a dS-based relative dating approach to analyze
all paralogous gene pairs included in the high-conﬁdence set of
PAPs. As expected, dS values were highly affected by saturation.
From 42% (NG method) to 83% (ML) of the paralogous pairs
did have saturated rates (dS > 1.5). Moreover, for the non-
saturated pairs, a great dispersion in dS values was found.
The average dS difference between the two paralogous gene

pairs in a PAP ranged from 0.26 (NG) to 0.30 (ML), with
stande deviation of 0.24 (NG) to 0.34 (ML). Thus, in this
benchmark, dS values provided little information as to whether
two paralogous gene pairs originated in the same duplication
event.

4 DISCUSSION

Overall, our results show the strengths and caveats of using dS
rates or phylogeny-based relative dating as a proxy for estimating
relative divergence times in genome-wide studies. Saturation of
dS rates is a well-known limitation and, accordingly, all studies
use this measure within appropriate limits. However, the extent to
which dS saturation is affecting genome-wide studies is generally
not quantiﬁed.

Alternative strategies based on phylogeny-based relative dating
such as the one proposed by us (Huerta-Cepas et (11., 2007) have
shown to be consistent and less prone to saturation, hence being
ideal for assigning ancient duplications to relative temporal scales.
The use of phylogenetic trees to detect duplication events and
provide a relative age has the additional advantage of allowing
a better resolution in the detection of paralogy relationships.
For instance, phylogenetic trees can differentiate among one-to-
one, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships, thus better
accounting for the complexity of the evolution of large gene families.
Moreover, phylogeny-based relative dating provides relative age
estimates that can be readily associated with speciﬁc evolutionary
periods. That is, they can be framed within the context of the
speciation events observed in the tree. Implementations of this
method in large-scale phylogenetic analysis tools such as ETE
(Huerta-Cepas et (11., 2010) or MANTiS (Tzika et (11., 2008) will
enable its wider use in genome-wide analyses aimed at addressing
relevant questions such as the content of ancestral genomes or
the discovery of functional trends in duplicated genes. It must
be noted, however, that there is still room for improvement,
since a correct topological mapping relies on the quality of the
underlying phylogenetic tree, the absence of horizontal transfer
events, the breadth and density of taxonomic sampling and our
level of understanding of the phylogeny of the species involved
(Hahn, 2007). In this context, as noted before (Milinkovitch et (11.,
2010) and conﬁrmed here, the presence of low-coverage genomes
may result in largely incorrect phylogeny-based relative datings
at affected nodes. In such scenarios, dS relative dating would be
more reliable, providing that the affected nodes fall within the
non-saturated range.

5 CONCLUSION

Considering all this, the combination of both strategies may provide
best results in the evolutionary analysis of gene duplication. For
instance, the use of phylogeny-based relative dating can provide a
reliable overview of the relative age of the duplications under study
as well as establishing the limits of dS saturation. Subsequently,
dS can be used to provide a more detailed view on the sequence
divergence within the subset of most recent duplications. Being
aware of the advantages and limitations of both methodologies,
as well as combining them in a sensible manner, will increase
our analytical potential and, most importantly, avoid possible
misinterpretation of the data.

Abstract

Summary: PathwaysWeb is a resource—based, well—documented web system that provides publicly
available information on genes, biological pathways, Gene Ontology (GO) terms, gene—gene inter—
action networks (importantly, with the directionality of interactions) and links to key—related
PubMed documents. The PathwaysWeb API simplifies the construction of applications that need to
retrieve and interrelate information across multiple, pathway—related data types from a variety of
original data sources. PathwaysBrowser is a companion website that enables users to explore the
same integrated pathway data. The PathwaysWeb system facilitates reproducible analyses by pro—
viding access to all versions of the integrated datasets. Although its GO subsystem includes data
for mouse, PathwaysWeb currently focuses on human data. However, pathways for mouse and
many other species can be inferred with a high success rate from human pathways.

Availability and implementation: PathwaysWeb can be accessed via the Internet at http://bioinfor—

1 Introduction

Although the inclusion of pathway and gene interaction information
into novel bioinformatics analysis methods is widely expected to re-
sult in more powerful and sensitive bioinformatic analyses, we
found it surprisingly difficult to assemble a comprehensive database
of pathway information in a form suitable for our requirements.
Specific challenges we faced included:

° Finding a single comprehensive source of pathway-related data
that maintains consistent approved identifiers for genes and bio-
logical pathways across multiple data sources.

° Finding data sources that provide coordinated snapshots of data
from multiple sources at a given time to enable replication of
results.

° Finding data licensed in a way that would allow us to make our
tools freely available, not just to academic institutions or requir-
ing an additional license agreement for use.

Although many databases and application programming inter-
faces (APIs) exist for retrieving pathway-related data for use in bio-
logical research, they provide data that are incomplete, use different
data identifiers or include databases that are not in sync with one
another. Those incompatibilities make the data difficult to merge.
Furthermore, the APIs and data formats change often and without
warning. Many systems have no API and require either the down-
load of an entire database or parsing of web pages to access the data
using an automated system. Some have severe limitations as to how
much information can be retrieved using a single search.

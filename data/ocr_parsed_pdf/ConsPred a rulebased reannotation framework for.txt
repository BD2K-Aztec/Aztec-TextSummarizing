Abstract

Motivation: The rapidly growing number of available prokaryotic genome sequences requires fully
automated and high—quality software solutions for their initial and re—annotation. Here we present
ConsPred, a prokaryotic genome annotation framework that performs intrinsic gene predictions,
homology searches, predictions of non—coding genes as well as CRISPR repeats and integrates all
evidence into a consensus annotation. ConsPred achieves comprehensive, high—quality annota—
tions based on rules and priorities, similar to decision—making in manual curation and avoids con—
flicting predictions. Parameters controlling the annotation process are configurable by the user.
ConsPred has been used in the institutions ofthe authors for longerthan 5 years and can easily be
extended and adapted to specific needs.

Summary: The ConsPred algorithm for producing a consensus from the varying scores of multiple
gene prediction programs approaches manual curation in accuracy. Its rule—based approach for
choosing final predictions avoids overriding previous manual curations.

Availability and implementation: ConsPred is implemented in Java, Perl and Shell and is freely
available under the Creative Commons license as a stand—alone in—house pipeline or as an Amazon
Machine Image for cloud computing, see https://sourceforge.net/projects/conspred/i

1 Introduction

 

During the two decades, since the sequencing of the first bacterial
genomes, the annotation of prokaryotic genome sequences has be-
come a routine task, going along with the rapid growth of public
databases (Tatusova et (11., 2015). This trend will further speed up
due to recent improvements in metagenomics, which enabled the re-
construction of near-complete genome sequences of low-abundant
microbial community members (Albertsen et (11., 2013; Brown et (11.,
2015; Callister et (11., 2010).

High-quality annotation of genome sequences is essential in all
areas of genome research and most important for comparative gen-
omics and functional genomics. Compared to automatic tools the

manual annotation achieves significantly better results (Iliopoulos
et (11., 2003). However, high costs and time constraints limit this
strategy to few model organisms or the annotation of very unusual
or taxonomically novel genomes (e.g. Spang et (11., 2012). The vast
majority of genome sequences in public databases have been anno-
tated using automatic software without expert curation.

A variety of software tools, which implement different gene and
function prediction approaches, have been developed. The annota-
tion of prokaryotic genomes stored in primary sequence archives is
thereby based on methodological choices by the authors and the par-
ticular time of submission. Re-annotation of genome sequences is
therefore crucial, e.g. in comparative genomics or re-sequencing

projects, to avoid artifacts due to technical inaccuracies (public pipe—
lines e.g. discussed in Siezen and van Hijum, 2010). Standardization
of annotation strategies and re—annotation has now also been ad—
dressed by the NCBI RefSeq project (Tatusova et al., 2015 ).

In addition to public resources, limited in capacity and flexibility
(e.g. Aziz et al., 2008; Markowitz et al., 2014; Vallenet et al., 2013),
also locally applicable tools for the re—annotation of prokaryotic
genomes are needed. Ideally, these should incorporate all relevant
types of evidence for structural and functional annotation, such as
(i) intrinsic prediction of coding sequences, (ii) homology—based pre—
diction of coding sequences and their function, (iii) structure/
sequence—based prediction of non—coding RNA genes and (iv) spe—
cific prediction of complex features, such as CRISPR repeats.
Several programs have been developed for this purpose (e.g. Kang
et al., 2007; Seemann, 2014), differing in their utilization of differ—
ent evidence types and their strategy for decision—making.

The authors of CONSORF (Kang et al., 2007) have demon—
strated that consensus gene prediction using hierarchical rules,
allows for fully automatic, high—accuracy identification of prokary—
otic genes. For large—scale re—annotation of prokaryotic genomes,
this concept needed to be further extended to non—coding genes,
complex features and functional annotation. Furthermore, accord—
ing to the high computational costs of sequence—similarity based
approaches, re—annotation software should be able to utilize high—
performance or cloud computing facilities. For these purposes, we
have developed ConsPred, which facilitated numerous of our gen—
ome sequencing and comparative genomics projects during the last
years (e.g. Probst et al., 2014). ConsPred is a flexible software
framework for fully automatic, integrative and comprehensive
(re—)annotation of prokaryotic genomes.

2 Description

In ConsPred multiple ab initio gene prediction tools can be applied
(Supplementary Table S1). For homology—based prediction, all open
reading frames (ORFs) are extracted and compared to the NCBI nr
(Coordinators, 2015) database of protein sequences or any other user—
defined protein database. In order to reduce ‘Shadow ORF” artifacts
and to avoid alignments only resulting from synteny with closely
related genomes, a specific taxonomy filter is applied. This filter ex—
cludes all proteins from closely related taxa—by default up to the
own genus level—from the homology search. Conserved ORFs are
trimmed to the first possible start position upstream of the alignment
and also screened for neighboring ORFs, sharing similarity to adja—
cent regions of the same database sequence, indicative of putative
pseudogenes. All ab initio predictions and conserved ORFs are
grouped by stop coordinate and strand. The consensus genes and their
start positions are determined from these groups following default
rules briefly summarized here: (i) ab initio predicted starts overrule
the start of conserved ORFs, (ii) ab initio predictions are evaluated
based on configurable ranks, representing previous knowledge about
the accuracy of prediction methods, e.g. for specific G + C contents,
(iii) overlapping ab initio predictions with support by conserved
ORFs overrule those without (Supplementary Fig. S1; Note S1).

Some non—protein—coding elements (NCEs; Supplementary Table
S1) are known to never overlap with CDS. ConsPred considers
rRNAs, tRNAs and CRISPR repeats as blocking and others, here
ncRNAs, as non—blocking. Consensus CDS overlapping blocked
regions are discarded to avoid misannotations (Tripp et al., 2011).
All consensus CDS that passed the filtering are functionally
annotated. The gene name, protein product and EC number are

determined from sequence similarity searches first in the manually
curated UniProt/SwissProt database and second, for all CDS
without SwissProt hits, in the UniRef90 database (UniProt, 2015 ).
Significant hits, whose alignment covers both query and subject by
at least 70%, are used for annotation transfer. Thereby ConsPred
preferably transfers annotations from the small but manually cura—
ted Swiss—Prot database, but also makes use of the much higher
coverage of TrEMBL. InterProScan (Mitchell et al., 2015 ) is used to
predict protein domains. Additionally, all consensus CDS are com—
pared to the KEGG (Kanehisa et al., 2014) and eggNOG (Powell
et al., 2014) databases and assignments to KEGG K0 and EC num—
bers, KEGG pathways and eggNOG orthologous groups and their
functional categories are exported (Supplementary Fig. S1). A de—
tailed description of the entire workflow and algorithm is given in
Supplementary Note S1.

3 Application

ConsPred runs on a single Linux computer or in a Linux grid com—
puting system. The database files for ConsPred are updated monthly
and can be downloaded from http://fileshare.csb.univie.ac.at/
c0nspred_data/ (~60 GB in 2015). ConsPred allows independent
customization for each annotation run. Depending on the genome
size and the computational resources the annotation takes few hours
to several days without user intervention.

4 Results

We used the well—curated genome of Escherichia coli K—12 MG1655
to demonstrate the ConsPred annotation compared to selected other
annotation platforms (Table 1). The majority of genes are consist—
ently annotated by all of the four platforms. Most pseudogenes are
annotated in the RefSeq record, resulting from human curation.
RAST and ConsPred additionally predict short genes, a consequence
of their lower minimal ORF length setting. Only ConsPred and
RAST provide KEGG annotations and ConsPred also includes
eggNOG assignments. Table 1 indicates that ConsPred provides a
comprehensive genome annotation regarding types of genetic elem—
ents and functional annotations (further details and data for add—
itional genomes with varying G + C content and assembly
completeness are shown in Supplementary Tables S2 and S3).

5 Conclusion

ConsPred is primarily useful for the annotation of finished genome
sequences or high—quality genome drafts (e.g. for submission to
public databases), and for genome re—annotation in comparative
genomics and functional genomics projects of prokaryotes.

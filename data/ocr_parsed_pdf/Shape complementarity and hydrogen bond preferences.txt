Abstract

Motivations: Characterizing protein—protein interfaces and the hydrogen bonds is a first step to
better understand proteins’ structures and functions toward high—resolution protein design.
However, there are few large—scale surveys of hydrogen bonds of interfaces. In addition, previous
work of shape complementarity of protein complexes suggested that lower shape complementar—
ity in antibody—antigen interfaces is related to their evolutionary origin.

Results: Using 6637 non—redundant protein—protein interfaces, we revealed peculiar features of
various protein complex types. In contrast to previous findings, the shape complementarity of anti—
body—antigen interfaces resembles that of the other interface types. These results highlight the im—
portance of hydrogen bonds during evolution of protein interfaces and rectify the prevailing belief

that antibodies have lower shape complementarity.

1 Introduction

Interactions are one of the most fundamental activities of biomol-
ecules. Disturbance of these interactions underlie biological disorders
including cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. Characterizing
interactions is important to understand the detailed mechanisms of
life (Russell and Aloy, 2008).

Complementarity is a key concept in molecular recognition.
Previous studies have extracted common features of protein—protein
interfaces and revealed peculiar features of particular classes of inter-
faces. Traditional structural surveys of protein—protein interactions
often divided complexes into hetero-dimers and homo-dimers and
into different functional classes, such as antibody—antigen, enzyme—
inhibitor/substrate and ‘other’ complexes (Jones, 2012; Lo Conte
et (11., 1999; Ofran and Rost, 2003; Vreven et (11., 2015). A key driving

force of molecular recognition and specificity is forming hydrogen
bonds and salt bridges. Unlike salt bridges, hydrogen bonds are orien-
tation-dependent. Hence, modulating hydrogen bond networks is crit-
ical for specificity in protein engineering and design (Stranges and
Kuhlman, 2013). Hydrogen bonds are also crucial for protein folding
where the patterns formed define secondary structure elements. Based
on 319 protein complexes, Nussinov and co-workers reported that
backbone—backbone hydrogen bonds are dominant within protein
structures whereas side-chain—side-chain hydrogen bonds are most
common across protein—protein interfaces (Xu et (11., 1997).

Another important factor in the complementarity of molecular
recognition is the shape of the interfaces. There are several analyses
on shape complementarity of protein interfaces (Lawrence and
Colman, 1993; Tsuchiya et (11., 2006). In such an analysis based on

correct VL—VH orientation during the antibody evolution, also
emphasizing the importance of the CDR—H3 backbone conform—
ation on the domain orientations.

A dominant hydrogen bond in VL—VH domains was between the
side chains of two glutamines at positions L38 and H39. This pair is
conserved in 86% (471/547) of the VL—VH dataset, and 88% (413/
471) of those side—chain pairs form hydrogen bonds. Despite the
high conservation in the sequences, an experiment has demonstrated
that the L38:Gln—H39:Gln hydrogen bond does not correlate with
antibody stability (Tan et al., 1998). Analysis on the relative orienta—
tion of the VL—VH domains of antibodies has become an active area
of research (Abhinandan and Martin, 2010; Chailyan et al., 2011;
Dunbar et al., 2013; Narayanan et al., 2009), along with the de—
mand for high—resolution antibody modeling (Almagro et al., 2011).
In light of this trend in the field, our analysis characterized VL—VH
interfaces by analyzing hydrogen bond networks, and our observa—
tion may be useful for the correct sampling of VL—VH domain orien—
tations. All hydrogen bonds in VL—VH interfaces are enumerated in
Supplementary Table 52.

Structure prediction of CDR—H3 is also a hot topic in antibody
modeling field (Almagro et al., 2011). Conformations of CDR—H3
can be classified into kink or extend forms (Kuroda et al., 2008),
and a few hydrogen bonds, such as L36:Tyr, appear to contribute
these conformations. However, these residues are not necessarily
conserved when CDR—H3 stems assume the kink conformation
(Kuroda et al., 2008), and these hydrogen bonds in the VL—VH inter—
faces alone do not define either kinked or extended conformations
(Weitzner et al., 2015). The kinked or extended region is defined as
four consecutive Cor atoms (H100X—H103) in antibodies having
CDR—H3 loops longer than four residues. In our VL—VH set, there
are 529 such antibodies, where kinked or extended conformations
are definable. When hydrogen bonds are broken down in the VL—VH
interfaces, 18.1% (354/1951) of them involve the kinked or ex—
tended regions, 30.5% of them involve the rest of the H3 loop and
39.4% of them are between L38:Gln—H39:Gln. The remaining
hydrogen bonds are in the other parts of the VL—VH domains.

The difficulty of CDR—H3 modeling arises mainly from the fact
that CDR—H3 is governed by V(D)] recombination. Although D and
J germline gene segments assignments are difficult, we can predict
the V genes using IgBLAST (Ye et al., 2013). We found that, in 10
897 somatic mutations of V genes in our VL—VH set, only 0.95%
(104/10 897) of the mutations contribute to hydrogen bonds in the
VL—VH interface. In other words, most of the hydrogen bonds in V
genes are encoded already in germline sequences, in agreement with
our observations that VL domains, which are less variable, tend to
use their side chains to form hydrogen bonds.

The distributions of the number of hydrogen bonds in all types
of the interfaces are available in Supplementary Figure 52. Overall,
the number of hydrogen bonds in the VL—VH interfaces (average 3.7)
was smaller compared with other interfaces (average 6.2—15.6), re—
flecting the hydrophobic nature of the VL—VH interfaces. This obser—
vation is consistent with the higher fraction of buried non—polar
atoms in VL—VH interfaces compared with other interfaces
(Supplementary Figure S3).

The average hydrogen bond densities (number of hydrogen
bonds per 100 A2 buried surface area) in each interface are given in
Supplementary Table S3. VL and VH domains and other obligate
complexes do not exist in isolation, i.e. they are always associated to
form a complex. However, a critical difference between VL—VH and
obligate interfaces is that the VL—VH domain pairing is generally
considered to be random, and VH domains can associate with sev—
eral different VL domains, which is known as receptor editing

(de Wildt et al., 1999). The smaller number of hydrogen bonds may
enable the quasi—promiscuous binding.

In antibody—protein antigen interfaces, as expected, there were
more hydrogen bonds to the VH domain than to the VL domain
(5.2 i 3.0 and 2.4 i 2.0, respectively) (Supplementary Figure 52),
emphasizing the importance of the VH domain in antigen recogni—
tion. Forty two percent (418/987) of the VH—mediated hydrogen
bonds involved CDR—H3, followed by CDR—H2 (H52—H56) and
FRH—mediated hydrogen bonds (24 and 23%, respectively). In the
FRH cases, most of the hydrogen bonds were formed by the residues
adjacent to CDRs, such as H58 (in 42 of 231 FRH—mediated hydro—
gen bonds, or 18%), H50 (12%), H33 (12%) and H61 (6%).
Similarly to the VL—VH interfaces, we also found that, in 4,460 som—
atic mutations of V genes in our antibody—protein set, only a small
fraction (163/4460 : 3.7%) of the mutations contribute to hydrogen
bonds in the V genes. Note that, in the antibody—protein interfaces,
about half (49%) of the hydrogen bonds are mediated by CDR—H3
and L3, both of which are generated by V(D)] recombination, and
we investigated only V genes here. Unlike VL—VH interfaces, most of
the interactions in antibody—antigen interfaces are via CDRs. Hence,
it is still possible that hydrogen bonds to antigens would be formed
via somatic mutations in CDR—H3 and L3.

In antibody—peptide interfaces, the number of backbone—back—
bone hydrogen bonds was comparable to the number of backbone—
side—chain or side—chain—backbone hydrogen bonds (Fig. 1C). A pos—
sible explanation is that peptide antigens are smaller than protein
antigens, and the number of residues that can contribute to inter—
actions with the antibody is smaller. As a result, the backbone of
peptide antigens needs to contact the antibody for favorable bind—
ing. On the antibody side, as previously reported in Bates et al.
(1998), peptide recognition of antibodies can be divided into two
structural classes depending on the length of CDR—H3; when H3 is
short (<7 residues), the peptide conformations are extended on the
pocket formed by the six CDR loops whereas when H3 is long
(27 residues), the peptides are buried into the pocket
(Supplementary Figure S4). Due to the spatial constraint, the back—
bones of antibodies more easily contact the peptides, especially in
the latter case, where, on average, there are more hydrogen bonds
between backbones of antibodies and the peptide antigens than the
first class of antibody—peptide complexes (1.6 i 1.3 and 2.9 i 2.1
for short and long H3, respectively).

It is sometimes difficult for epitope scanning (Jemmerson, 1987)
to recognize a conformational epitope since tertiary interactions
within the protein stabilize the peptide conformation; these inter—
actions are absent in the lone peptide. So segmented proteins have
unsatisfied backbone hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and antibod—
ies that recognize peptides may have to make backbone contacts to
stabilize the peptide conformation. Some antibodies may bind a lone
epitope peptide in a different conformation than the binding to the
epitope in the parent—protein context.

3.2 Backbone—backbone hydrogen bonds are common
in protease—inhibitor complexes, but not in the other
enzyme—inhibitor/substrate complexes

Unlike the other interfaces, the most frequent hydrogen bonding
pattern in enzyme complexes was the backbone—backbone pair
(Fig. 1D). When dividing the enzymes into proteases and other
types, the dominant hydrogen bonds in the protease—inhibitor com—
plexes were backbone—backbone hydrogen bonds whereas those in
the other types of enzymes came from the side—chain—side—chain
pairs, as seen in other interfaces. This observation is probably a

proposed in protein—protein interfaces (Luo et al., 2013).
Furthermore, by exploiting all the 57 944 PDB entries available at
that time (June 2009), 20 034 atomic—resolution motifs (i.e. 3D or—
ganization of atoms) were identified in protein—protein interfaces
(Kinjo and Nakamura, 2010). In the past, few studies investigated
the hydrogen bonds in interfaces beyond the average numbers and
the individual geometries, such as angles and distances (Lo Conte
et al., 1999; McDonald and Thornton 1994; Xu et al., 1997). In the
case of antibodies specifically, there are some studies about hydro—
gen bonds in antibody—antigen (protein) interfaces (Dalkas et al.,
2014; Peng et al., 2014; Ramaraj et al., 2012), but few discussed the
insights into evolution (i.e. somatic maturations) and peptide im—
munizations, nor analyzed VL—VH domain interface, as we have
done in this study. The results in this report have implications for
antibody modeling and protein—protein docking problems. Since
hydrogen bonds via backbones can be preserved after mutations,
asymmetry of hydrogen bonding patterns in VL—VH interfaces sug—
gests that mutations in VH domain might be more tolerated than
those in VL domain in engineering better antibodies. Hydrogen
bond density of VL—VH interfaces is almost half of those of the other
interfaces, highlighting the hydrophobic, promiscuous nature of the
domain associations. Although there seems to be no obvious correl—
ations between the number of hydrogen bonds and the geometric de—
scriptors of VL—VH orientations (Supplementary Figure S8) (Dunbar
et al., 2013), constraining the conserved L3 8:Gln—H39:Gln hydro—
gen bonds during the domain orientation sampling would be a pos—
sible approach to better capture correct VL—VH orientations.
Packing VL side chains could be critical in CDR—H3 modeling and
VL—VH positioning. Finally, epitope scanning by fragmentation of
antigens may lead to unusual recognition of peptides and/or binding
that differs from the binding of the full antigen.

Backbone—backbone hydrogen bonds are common in the prote—
ase—inhibitor complexes. An important problem in protein—protein
docking is in global sampling i.e., identification of potential—binding
sites of protein surfaces. An application of our observations may be
to use backbone complementarity based on hydrogen bonds and,
possibly, to use information of dehydration of backbone atoms
(Fernandez and Scheraga, 2003) to identify binding sites in prote—
ase—inhibitor systems.

In contrast to the previous discussion, the shape complementar—
ity of antibody—protein interfaces seems to be similar to those of
other interfaces. Through somatic maturation, antibodies can evolve
over short time scales, leading to antibodies having higher affinity
and stability, even though the evolution toward binding is only on
one side of the interface, it is sufficient to reach high shape comple—
mentarity typical of other protein—protein interface types (Li et al.,
2003). Still, higher gap volume index being considered, water mol—
ecules could also play a role to complete the better fit of interfaces.
Although modulating hydrogen bonds in computational design is
still challenging, mimicking the maturation process, designing pro—
teins with higher shape complementarity by modulating backbone—
backbone hydrogen bonds, as observed in the protease—inhibitor
complexes, is a promising approach.

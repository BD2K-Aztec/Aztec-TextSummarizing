Abstract

We present LuciPHOr2, a site localization tool for generic post—translational modifications (PTMs)
using tandem mass spectrometry data. As an extension of the original LuciPHOr (version 1) for
phosphorylation site localization, the new software provides a site—level localization score for gen—
eric PTMs and associated false discovery rate called the false localization rate. We describe several
novel features such as operating system independence and reduced computation time through
multiple threading. We also discuss optimal parameters for different types of data and illustrate the
new tool on a human skeletal muscle dataset for lysine—acetylation.

1 Introduction

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) induce conformational
changes in proteins that influence their enzymatic activity, subcellu-
lar localization and/or their binding affinity (Hoffman et (11., 2008;
Silva et (11., 2013). High-throughput analysis of PTMs is typically
achieved through mass spectrometry (MS) (Silva et (11., 2013), where
tandem (MS/MS) mass spectra are searched against a sequence data-
base allowing for PTMs. A major challenge in the interpretation of
MS/MS data for PTMs is that database search engines can correctly
match a peptide sequence with incorrectly localized PTM(s). These
errors are not controlled by the type I error of peptide identification
because each peptide has a different degree of uncertainty as far as
site localization is concerned. For this reason, the conventional tar-
get-decoy framework often leads to underestimation of the error
rates for site localization of PTMs (Fermin et (11., 2013). Hence, an

additional procedure to control the number of false site localizations
is necessary when reporting PTM localization analysis results at the
proteome scale.

2 Functional features

2.1 Improved implementation

To address this issue, we recently published a computational method
called LuciPHOr for site localization analysis of phosphorylation
events using MS/MS data (Fermin et (11., 2013). LuciPHOr was first
implemented with a novel target-decoy framework specifically de-
signed for phospho-site localization. Here, we have converted this
tool into a general PTM localization program (LuciPHOrZ) for esti-
mating false localization rate (FLR) for any PTMs of a fixed mass.
The new implementation provides enhancements over the previous

version: (i) it is written entirely in Java, making it operating system
independent; (ii) the software now processes search results from any
proteomics search engine.

2.2. Key parameters for site localization

In LuciPHOr2, the user is expected to specify key parameters for
statistical modeling, which determine inclusion/exclusion of MS/MS
peaks into the scoring algorithm. LuciPHOr2 constructs a probabil—
ity model of peak intensity and mass accuracy across all spectra for
correct and incorrect localizations respectively, and computes the
likelihood ratio as the localization score for each candidate site. This
requires an appropriate choice of low/high mass accuracy model
(ALGORITHM parameter), fragment mass tolerance (MS2_TOL)
and the criteria for selecting high confidence localizations to train
the probability model (SELECTION_METHOD).

Two additional parameters are worth mentioning in this new
version: the target modification and the mass shift of the PTM of
interest. Since LuciPHOr2 was designed to score generic PTMs, the
user must specify what amino acids should be treated as potential
modification sites along with their respective mass shifts. The mass
shift is required for the program to place decoy PTMs on arbitrary
sites (non—specific residues) and accurately estimate the FLR.

To facilitate the optimal configuration, LuciPHOr2 generates a
template input file that the user can edit for their specific needs.
However, we note that the default parameters generated in this file
are optimized for phosphorylation analysis.

3 Application to generic PTM analysis

We demonstrate the program through the analysis of a published
dataset for lysine acetylation in 12 human skeletal muscle biopsies
(Lundby et al., 2012). The RAW files were converted into the open—
source format szL using MSConvert from the ProteoWizard
package (Kessner et al., 2008), and searched with XlTandem (Fenyo
and Beavis, 2003). The database search was performed as described
by Lundby et al. with two exceptions: the precursor tolerance was
increased to 20 ppm and up to five missed cleavages were allowed.
The peptide search results were post—processed using PeptideProphet
of the TPP (Deutsch et al., 2010; Keller et al., 2002). All peptide—to—
spectrum matches (PSMs) with a lysine acetylation event were rean—
alyzed with LuciPHOr2 configured for lysine—acetylations
(K+42.01056).

A total of 35 482 PSMs were reported with acetylation by
XlTandem/T PP. To filter high—quality spectra, 30 602 PSMs within
the 1% FDR threshold (PeptideProphet probability 0.809) were se—
lected, and among these 20 754 PSMs had site ambiguity (68%). As
expected for a non—labile modification, XlTandem/T PP and
LuciPHOr2 showed concordant site localization on the majority of
ambiguous cases (19 557/20 754, 94%). For a non—negligible num—
ber of PSMs (673/19 557, 3.4%), however, LuciPHOr2 delta score
was <3 between the top two localizations, indicating that those sites
were localized based on merely a single fragment ion or less credible
low intensity fragments, implying considerable ambiguity.

On the other hand, LuciPHOr2 and XlTandem/T PP disagreed
on 1197 site localizations, consisting of two major types. The first
type were 987 PSMs with the ambiguity on two consecutive lysines
at the end of the peptide sequences (e.g. VLTLELYQ), whereas the
second type were 210 PSMs with the ambiguity in the middle of the
sequences (e.g. DNKKPFIKEAAMAK). In nearly all of the latter
cases, there was no major site discriminating fragment ion. This is

(matched peaks only). Black peaks are shard ions, while red and blue ones
are the site determining ions for each site localization. The two site localiza-
tions are shown in the text in the upper left corner of each panel (lower case
indicates PTM sites). (a) Peptide with a low score due to lack of clear site
determining ions. (b) Peptide with a high score with evidence for both local-
izations, indicating the possibility of co-eluting positional isomers

illustrated in Figure 1a, where only a few minor peaks support both
candidate sites (Supplemental Table 51).

Another advantage of LuciPHOr2 is that it produces a peak—by—
peak score report for the two best site localizations, which can assist
identification of positional isomers. The term ‘positional isomers”
refers to two co—eluting species of the same peptide with different
site localizations (Courcelles et al., 2012), often captured in the
same MS/MS spectrum. To find these, the peak score report can be
queried for the peptides with high likelihood scores (e.g. >30 for
low mass accuracy data, >50 for high mass accuracy data) with a
sufficient number of site determining ions for each localization.
Figure 1b shows the spectrum for KWYNLMIQNKDDLAR, which
has 18 and 16 site determining ions for the two lysines
(Supplemental Table 51). This example was easily queried with the
following criteria: the top two localizations score above 50 on the
same spectrum and have more than five site determining ions.

4 Conclusions

In sum, the post hoc analysis of site localization of PTMs using the
database search output is an essential step toward the control of
type I errors in large—scale PTM analysis. The LuciPHOr2 package
facilitates such analysis using the peptide identification from various
database search engines, and is expected to contribute to more re—
bust analysis of proteome—level PTM analysis in a wide range of
applications.

Semantic Measures Library and toolkit

 

CeCILL license (compatible with the widely used GNU General
Public License).

The SML uses cross—platform JAVA programing language
version 1.7, which is available for most operating systems.
It can be used to compute semantic similarities of concepts/
terms deﬁned in structured terminologies and ontologies. It can
also be used to assess the semantic similarity of pairs of entities
annotated by concepts, e. g. patient records annotated by groups
of concepts, genes annotated by GO terms, PubMed articles
annotated by MeSH descriptors. Considering a pair of terms/
entities, the library computes a similarity score. Developers
can, therefore, easily embed source code referring to the library
to compute measures in their own algorithms and applications.

The library supports various ontology formats and speciﬁca—
tions (e. g. OBO, RDF, OWL). Specific ontology loaders are also
provided to handle widely used biomedical terminologies such as
MeSH and SNOMED Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT). Custom
knowledge representation loaders can also be added to the SML.
In addition, low—level access to the library enables developers to
ﬁnely control the underlying graph model (ontology) to apply
speciﬁc treatments sometimes required for the computation of
semantic measures (e. g. transitive reduction to remove taxonom—
ical redundancies).

A large collection of semantic measures is provided out—of—the—
boxiversion 0.7 supports about 50 measures relying on different
strategies. Thanks to the fine—grained control provided by the
library, this leads to about 1500 specific measure conﬁgurations
that can be speciﬁed for context—speciﬁc applications. In add—
ition, the algorithms developed in the SML provide the designers
of semantic measures an extensive Application Programming
Interface and framework to easily develop, test and evaluate
new measures. Moreover, because of its generic underlying
graph data model, semantic measures developed using the
SML will beneﬁt a large audience. Those measures are not
restricted to a speciﬁc ontology, which is the case with existing
software solutions, and can, therefore, be used with the
various knowledge representations supported by the library.
Furthermore, the SML relies on a graph model compatible
with the Linked Data paradigm. This enables SML users to
take advantage of the growing number of datasets published
according to Linked Data and Semantic Web visions, e.g. see
Bio2RDF initiative (Belleau et al., 2008).

The SML enables large—scale computations and analyses of
semantic measures. It supports multi—threaded processes for
fast parallel computation on multicore processors. Table 1
presents a running time comparison between three libraries dedi—
cated to the GO and the SML (detailed protocol, associated
source code and additional evaluations are provided at http://
www.semantic—measures—library.com/sml/performance).

Based on the SML, an open—source toolkit enables non—
developers to benefit from functionalities provided by the library
through easy to use command—line software. The SML—Toolkit is
highly tuneable and enables context—speciﬁc conﬁgurations to be
speciﬁed depending on the experiment performed: knowledge
base to use (ontologies, annotations), required data preprocess—
ing (e.g. the removal of taxonomic redundancies), measure
constraints (e.g. algorithmic complexity, information to take
into account), set of queries to perform (i.e. concept or entity
identifiers) and other (optional) parameters (e.g. output file,

computer resources allocated). Detailed conﬁgurations can be
speciﬁed using an extensible mark—up language ﬁle. Speciﬁc com—
mand—line interfaces, called proﬁles, are also developed to ease
the use of the SML—Toolkit in speciﬁc use cases, e. g. to estimate
the similarity of genes regarding their GO term annotations.
Such profiles can be used to hide the advanced capabilities of
the library, and therefore improve the experience for users inter—
ested only in computing semantic measures in a speciﬁc context
of use (e.g. gene or disease analysis). Related source code and
issue trackers are available from the public dedicated repository.
Community support is also provided to facilitate usage and
ensure improvements of both the library and the toolkit.

Open source, generic, efﬁcient and highly tuneable, the SML
and the toolkit are not limited to a speciﬁc ontology and can,
therefore, be used in a broad ﬁeld of application, (scientiﬁc)
projects and software solutions [e.g. Harispe et a]. (2013), Sy
et a1. (2012)].

We propose to apply a variable selection method with speciﬁc
application in high—dimensional miRNA expression data with
repeated or multiple measures. Wang et al. proposed a novel
penalized GEE (PGEE) (Wang et al., 2012) method to select
variables when the number of covariates is moderate in a re—
peated or multiple measures setting. PGEE is able to account
for both within subject correlation and dependencies between
different biomarkers. However, PGEE typically fails in the pres—
ence of high—dimensional biomarkers, i.e. when the number of
biomarkers is larger than the sample size. To tackle this issue,
we develop a prescreening—based PGEE with grid search (PGS)
method. Our method consists of an iterative two—step approach.
Step 1, uses the screening method to downsize the biomarkers,
whereas Step 2 feeds the ‘survived’ biomarkers to the PGEE. We
repeat these two steps in a grid search and perform K—fold cross—
validation to determine tuning parameters.

We test our methods in a miRNA proﬁling dataset generated
from our Beijing Truck Driver Air Pollution Study (BTDAS)
(Baccarelli et al., 2011; Byun et al., 2013; Guo et al., 2014;
Hou et al., 2012; 2013a,b). In BTDAS, we measured air pollution
and health outcomes, including lung functions, twice with 172
weeks apart. We also collected blood samples twice for bio—
marker measurements, including miRNA profiling.

Based on repeated measures miRNA collected in BTDAS, we
apply PGS to model the lung function levels measured by forced
expiratory volume in one second (FEVl), with the goal of de—
tecting lung function—related miRNAs and uncovering regulatory
pathways. We also compare PGS with GEE/LMM SBS testing
in terms of prediction error of lung function levels and enrich—
ment of lung function—related biological pathways. In addition, a
simulation study is conducted to examine the extensions of PGS.

2 METHODS

2.1 Penalized Generalized Estimating Equations

PGEE (Wang et al., 2012) has emerged as a useful method for analyzing
repeatedly measured data with a moderate number of covariates. The
algorithm is able to select non-zero effects among a number of predictors
via adding penalty terms to the traditional GEE. The penalized general-
ized estimating functions U03) are deﬁned as below:

U03) = $03) - C1 i(|ﬁ|)Sign(/3)

where S03) are the estimating functions deﬁning a GEE; qA(|/3|) are the
penalty functions that introduce penalties to each of non-zero )3 estimate,
so that if certain true ﬁi are zero, the algorithm would force the estimates
to be zeroes; sign(ﬁ) is the sign vector for )3. Tuning parameter A within
the penalty functions qA(|/3|), is the coefﬁcient of penalty terms, and it
determines the amount of shrinkage, i.e. bigger A leads to smaller overall
size of estimated effects. To select the effect size that best ﬁts the data, A
will be tuned among a sequence of candidate values using K-fold cross-
validation.

2.2 PGEE with Grid Search

To enhance the reliability of PGEE selection result, we perform PGEE on
a sequence of subsets of the biomarkers based on the ranking of signiﬁ-
cance (e.g. P-values) obtained by a univariate prescreening analysis ad-
justed for confounders. Each time a certain number of top biomarkers
(denoted as Pm) enter the PGEE model, Pm becomes a tuning parameter
and constitute a searching grid together with PGEE penalty parameter A.
By running PGEE throughout all parameter pairs (Pm, A) in the grid, the

best pair would be achieved in terms of the smallest prediction error
calculated by 20-fold cross-validation. With the best parameter pair set-
ting, biomarkers with absolute coefﬁcient ()3) estimates >0.001 were se-
lected as inﬂuential biomarkers.

2.3 Model comparison between PGS and GEE/LMM

Two evaluation matrices were considered in model comparison: pheno-
type prediction performance and enrichment of phenotype-related biolo-
gical pathway.

2.3.1 Phenotype prediction performance Smaller prediction error
indicates better phenotype prediction performances, and thus higher
value of disease diagnosis using the biomarkers selected from a model.
To obtain comparable prediction errors between PGS and SBS testing,
the 10-fold cross-validation procedure used in PGS was implemented to
SBS testing.

2.3.2 Enrichment of phenotype—related biological pathway A
higher enrichment of biological pathway suggests that the sites selected
from a model is biologically plausible. miRNA pathway enrichment ana-
lysis was conducted using DIANA-mirPath v2.0 (Vlachos et al., 2012)
(http://www.microrna.gr/miRPathv2), a Web-based computational tool
incorporating an in silico miRNA target prediction tool using high pre-
diction accuracy algorithm DIANA-microT-CDS (Paraskevopoulou
et al., 2013). Gene union set targeted by at least one selected miRNA
was identiﬁed. miRNA- and pathway-related information was obtained
from miRBase 18 (Kozomara and Grifﬁths-Jones, 2011) and KEGG
v58.1 (Kanehisa et al., 2012), respectively. To deﬁne a reliable miRNA-
gene target prediction, microT score threshold >0.9 was used in DIANA-
microT-CDS such that the miRNA-predicted genes were also predicted
by miRanda (John et al., 2004) and/or TargetScan 5.0 (Friedman et al.,
2009). For enrichment tests, we applied Fisher’s Exact test based on
jackkniﬁng the test’s probability (Hosack et al., 2003), which is more
conservative than Fisher’s Exact test so that pathways with fewer targeted
genes are penalized. The Benjamini and Hochberg FDR (Benjamini and
Hochberg, 1995) was calculated to adjust for multiple hypothesis testing.
Signaling pathways that have been shown to be associated with lung
function were identiﬁed (Zander et al., 2007). The enrichment score of
lung function-related signaling pathway was quantiﬁed using negative
loglO of the FDR.

2.4 Beijing Truck Driver Air Pollution Study

The BTDAS, conducted between June 15 and July 27, 2008, included
participants with high exposure to air pollution in Beijing. All partici-
pants were examined on two separate examination days with 172 weeks
apart. Detailed study design and data measurements were described pre-
viously (Baccarelli et al., 2011). Lung function was quantiﬁed by FEVl
on both examination days. Total RNA was extracted from peripheral
blood collected from each participant on both examination days. For
better delineation of the direct effects of miRNAs, 10 potential confoun-
ders including PM2_5, sex, age, BMI, smoking status, usage of central
heating, commuting time, working hours per day, dew point and tem-
perature were adjusted in lung function in GEE/LMM SBS testing and
PGS.

3 RESULTS

3.1 miRNA proﬁling data

We conducted miRNA analysis on 240 blood samples collected
on two examination days separated by a 172 week interval from
n = 120 study subjects. Detailed miRNA extraction and proﬁling
data preprocessing can be found in the Supplementary Material.

the effects of these biomarkers could be signiﬁcant when mod—
eled together. PGS is able to capture these complex features
across all input biomarkers and detect inﬂuential ones that
SBS testing would potentially ignore.

It is worth noting that PGS does not provide exact P—values, as
the estimates do not follow normal distribution under the null
hypotheses. Therefore, the criterion for determining inﬂuential
biomarker in PGS is not based on P—value, but on the threshold
for coefﬁcient (ﬂ) estimates of biomarkers. Inﬂuential bio—
markers are selected when the estimates are greater than the
threshold. As suggested in Wang’s paper (Wang et al., 2012),
the default threshold is 0.001, which is also proved to be a prac—
tical and robust threshold in our simulation study in terms of
sensitivity and speciﬁcity. To ensure that the threshold of 0.001
works uniformly for any dataset, it is required to standardize
each of the biomarkers with mean of zero and standard deviation
of one as a typical procedure before running penalize model.

Robust selection of biomarkers by PGS relies on the setting of
grid boundary and grid resolution. Too large A would shrink all
ﬂ estimates to zero, whereas too small A would not shrink the
estimates at all. Our numerical experience in similar settings sug—
gests that a range of A from 0.01 to 0.30 should cover the optimal
A for most of the cases. Within this range, an increment of 0.02 in
A provides a proper grid resolution to capture subtle effect
changes of A on biomarker selection results without much
extra computational burden. On the other hand, a too large
Pm might defy the application of PGS, whereas a too small Pm
might underexploit the data. An optimal Pm could be found
around the sample size, as is the case in our miRNA study ex—
ample, where the optimal Pm = 110. Besides, an increment of 10
or 20 in Pm provides a sufﬁcient resolution for capturing the
effects of increasing Pm on biomarker selection. For all practical
usage, the initiation of A vector can be varied from 0.01 to 0.30,
and the initiation of Pm can be a vector with a few numbers
varied around the sample size minus the number of confounders
(in our case, it is 120710 = 110). It is not necessary to initiate a
full vector of Pm, as it adds redundant parameter pairs to the
grid. Extension of A boundary and/ or Pm boundary will be con—
sidered only when the optimal A and/or Pm hit the initial bound—
aries. In this article, we used different elaborate A ranges (but all
were within the 0.017030 range) for better results representa—
tions, and higher grid resolution (i.e. smaller increment of A)
for more reliable method evaluations in simulation studies.

Insensitive to mis—speciﬁcation of the covariance structure is a
feature that distinguishes GEE from LMM. Inheriting this fea—
ture from GEE, PGS is able to estimate the correlation matrix
regardless of whether the structure is speciﬁed. Based on the
estimation, one could either use LMM—based PGS with a solid
guess of the covariance structure or use GEE—based PGS if there
is no good choice of the structure.

Prescreening step prioritizes potentially inﬂuential biomarkers,
which facilitates PGS to handle the situation in which the
number of biomarkers is considerably larger than the sample
size. GEE and LMM are two handy approaches for prescreen—
ing. However, the potential limitation of prescreening is that
miRNAs with small but true non—zero effects may be excluded
during the prescreening step. Nevertheless, with a given sample
size, the grid search method in PGS ensures that PGEE can
include as many biomarkers as possible.

5 CONCLUSION

The performance of PGS is comparable with the approaches
being benchmarked, i.e. SBS GEE/LMM. However, PGS is
more suitable for high—dimensional miRNA expression data
with repeated measures in that, by exploiting underlying depend—
ent structures, it relies on variable selection in the context of a
multiple regression model, which circumvents multiple testing
issues. PGS is also applicable to other longitudinally collected
high—dimensional quantitative data, such as epigenomics, mRNA
transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc. The growing
number of studies conducting high—dimensional proﬁling dataset
using different platforms requires a more comprehensive evalu—
ation of PGS in various study settings.

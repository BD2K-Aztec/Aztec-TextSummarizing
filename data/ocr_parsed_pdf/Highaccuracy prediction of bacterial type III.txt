ABSTRACT

Motivation: Bacterial type III secreted (T 38) effectors are delivered
into host cells specifically via type III secretion systems (T 3883),
which play important roles in the interaction between bacteria
and their hosts. Previous computational methods for T38 protein
prediction have only achieved limited accuracy, and distinct features
for effective T38 protein prediction remain to be identified.

Results: In this work, a distinctive N-terminal position-specific amino
acid composition (Aac) feature was identified for T38 proteins.
A large portion (~50%) of T38 proteins exhibit distinct position-
specific Aac features that can tolerate position shift. A classifier,
BPBAac, was developed and trained using Support Vector Machine
(8VM) based on the Aac feature extracted using a Bi-profile Bayes
model. We demonstrated that the BPBAac model outperformed other
implementations in classification of T38 and non-T38 proteins, giving
an average sensitivity of ~90.97% and an average selectivity of
~97.42% in a 5-fold cross-validation evaluation. The model was also
robust when a small-size training dataset was used. The fact that
the position-specific Aac feature is commonly found in T38 proteins
across different bacterial species gives this model wide application.
To demonstrate the model’s application, a genome-wide prediction
of T38 effector proteins was performed for Ralstonia solanacearum,
an important plant pathogenic bacterium, and a number of putative
candidates were identified using this model.

1 INTRODUCTION

Six types of secretion systems have been identiﬁed in Gram-negative
bacteria, two of which (type I and type II) have been studied
extensively (Bingle et al., 2008; Fath and Kolter, 1993; Fischer et al.,
2002; Henderson et al., 2004; Hueck, 1998). The type III secretion
system (T3SS) has been widely adopted by different bacteria, such as
animal pathogens Salmonella, Shigella and Vibrio, plant pathogens
Pseudomonas, Xanthomonas, and Ralstonia, and some symbiotic
bacteria such as Rhizobia (Hueck, 1998). T3SSs play important

roles in host—pathogen interactions that are often mediated by T3S
effectors speciﬁcally secreted into host cells through the type III
secretion conduits (Galan and Wolf-Watz, 2006).

Previous studies have shown that the ﬁrst 100 amino acid at the
N-terminal region may contain the signal peptides and chaperone-
binding sequences needed to guide the secretion of T3S proteins
(Karavolos et al., 2005; Lloyd et al., 2001, 2002; Russmann et al.,
2002; Schechter et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2008). Most known T3S
proteins have at least one chaperone, which mediates its secretion
through the extremely narrow T3S conduit (Stebbins and Galan,
2001). Unlike most other signal peptides, T3S signals are not cleaved
after secretion. Due to low sequence similarity and lack of common
features among different T3S signal sequences, the established
prediction methods used for identifying signal peptides do not
apply to T3S signals (Galan and Wolf-Watz, 2006; Hueck, 1998).
Computational prediction of T3S protein has long been considered
to be a particularly difﬁcult challenge.

Computational approaches have been attempted to predict T3S
proteins based on sequence similarity, consensus patterns, gene-
adjacent sequence features, etc. (Panina et al., 2005; Petnicki-
chieja et al., 2002; Tobe et al., 2006). Different machine learning
algorithms, e.g. Naive Bayes (NB), Artiﬁcial Neural Network
(ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Arnold et al., 2009;
Lower and Schneider, 2009; Samudrala et al., 2009; Yang et al.,
2010), have also been adopted to identify the general signal features.
Some important features, including G+C content of the primary
DNA sequence, general enrichment and depletion of N-terminal
amino acid composition (Aac), composition frequency of secondary
structure elements (coil, helices or strands) and water accessibility
states (exposed or buried) have been identiﬁed and used for
in silico prediction (Arnold et al., 2009; Lower and Schneider, 2009;
Samudrala et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2010). Effective T3, one of the
earliest software developed for T3S protein prediction (Arnold et al.,
2009), explores possible sequence-based features exhaustively. In
Effective T3, the Aac and property preference within the signal
region (not position speciﬁc) was represented in two reduced
alphabets (Arnold et al., 2009), which may lead to loss of signal
information buried in individual amino acid. In addition, no position-
speciﬁc features were analyzed in Effective T3. An ANN model
proposed by Lower and Schneider (2009) adopts a sliding window
technique (with a window width of 25) and an optimal model is
obtained based on the signal sequence located within the ﬁrst 30
amino acids at the N-terminal end (Lower and Schneider, 2009).
Although this model achieved high selectivity (98%), its sensitivity
was rather low (74%). Some drawbacks of the ANN model should

also be pointed out: (i) the training dataset was not validated and it
contains wrongly annotated non-T3S proteins, including chaperones
located in cytoplasm and a number of validated ﬂagella proteins
not secreted through T3SSs. In addition, some proteins with high
homology were not excluded; (ii) the classifying performance was
based on train-reclassiﬁcation results only and no cross-validation
was performed; and (iii) its complexity makes it difﬁcult to interpret
the biological implications. Most recently, a SVM model, SSE-ACC,
was proposed to learn features using Aac-Sse and Aac-Acc (Aac, Sse
and Acc represents amino acid composition, secondary structure and
solvent accessibility, respectively) combination frequencies using
SVM (Yang et al., 2010). These features, however, was trained
from only one plant pathogen genus and then used to predict the
T3S effectors in Rhizobium. The authors reported a signiﬁcantly
increased selectivity (91%) with a trade-off of apparently lowered
sensitivity (65%). Therefore, new features need to be identiﬁed and
used for more effective T3S protein identiﬁcation.

We here propose a computational model based on position-
speciﬁc Aac proﬁle for effective T3S protein prediction. We
demonstrate that our model outperformed other current imple-
mentations and achieved both high sensitivity (97.42%) and
high selectivity (90.97%) in a 5-fold cross-validation experiment.
A genome-wide prediction of T3S effectors in an important plant
pathogen, namely Ralstonia solanacearum, was also conducted.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data source

A list of experimentally validated T3S proteins from animal pathogens,
plant pathogens and symbiotic bacteria was manually annotated from a
literature search. A list of non-T3S proteins were randomly selected from
different bacteria, followed by removal of the known effectors and their
homologs. For T35 and non-T3S proteins, only one representative was
selected as the training sequence for each orthologous or paralogous cluster.
JAligner, an alignment tool implementing Smith7Waterman algorithm was
used to make a pairwise alignment for any two T3S or non-T3S proteins
(http://jaligner.sourceforge.net/). The ratio between the pairwise score and
self-score is calculated. A sensitive cutoff, 0.15, was set for identifying
paralogs or orthologs (Arnold at al., 2009). In total, 154 non-redundant T3S
peptides obtained were subsequently used as positive dataset. As the number
of non-T3S proteins was much larger than the number of positive proteins,
308 peptides were randomly selected from the negative peptide pool to form
ﬁnal negative training set, to overcome the imbalance between positive and
negative datasets (Arnold at al., 2009; Kim et al., 2004). Details of these
two datasets and the reference for each T3S protein can be found in the
Supplementary Materials (Text S 1). The Sse (represented as a combination
sequence of ‘C’, ‘H’ or ‘E’ of each sequence) was predicted using PSIPRED
(McGufﬁn at al., 2000), and SCRATCH (Cheng et al., 2005) was used to
predict the Acc (a combination of ‘B’ or ‘E’). For 5-fold cross-validation,
the negative and positive training datasets were pooled as the ﬁnal training
datasets and were evenly split into ﬁve sub-datasets, each containing the
same number of positive/negative samples.

2.2 Position-speciﬁc proﬁles and feature extraction

The unaligned T3S proteins and non-T3S proteins were used for position-
speciﬁc feature extraction. Let vector S =s1,s2,s3, ...,s,, denotes a peptide
sequence in which X represents amino acid or other properties while 1,2, . ..
or i represents position and n represents the total sequence length. For m
sequences, the position-speciﬁc occurrence of a certain amino acid A is
described as: p(A,»)= f (Ag/mi, in which f(A,») denotes the frequency of
amino acid A at position i. For each position, the p(A,») of different amino

acids form a position set (or proﬁle), and for a sequence S with a length of n,
n values (extracted from each position set) comprise a composition vector.
Similar proﬁles and feature vectors were extracted for corresponding Sse
and Acc in T35 or non-T3S peptides. WebLogo was adopted to exhibit the
position-speciﬁc preference proﬁles (Crooks at al., 2004).

For feature extraction, both the Bi-proﬁle Bayes (BPB) method (Shao
at al., 2009) and the more frequently applied Single-proﬁle Bayes method
(SPB) were adopted as appropriate. These two methods are similar except that
BPB takes into consideration the features of negative training dataset. Simply,
given a protein sequence S=s1,s2,s3,...,s,,, where each Si (i=1,...,n)
denotes an amino acid at position i, and n denotes the sequence length, S can
be classiﬁed as one of the two classes: C1 (T3S proteins) or C_1 (non-T3S
proteins). The posterior probability of both T35 and non-T3S proteins can be
calculated as the occurrence of each amino acid at each position in the training
dataset. More details about the BPB method can be found in Shao at al.
(2009). The BPB and SPB signatures were extracted for position-speciﬁc
amino acid composition, Sse and Acc.

2.3 SVMs implementation and parameter optimization

R package for SVM, ‘e1071’, was used to train and build the SVM
models (http://cran.r-project.org/). Radial basis kernel function K(si,sj)=
exp(—y| ls, — sjl |2) was selected for SVM prediction. SVM parameter y and
penalty parameter C were optimized using grid search based on 10-fold
cross-validation (Scholkopf and Smola, 2002).

2.4 Performance assessment

Accuracy (A), Speciﬁcity (Sp), Sensitivity (Sn), Receiver Operating
Characteristic (ROC) curve, the area under ROC curve (AUC) and Matthews
Correlation Coefﬁcient (MCC) were utilized to assess the predictive
performance. In the following formula, A denotes the percentage of
both positive instances (T35) and negative instances (non-T3S) correctly
predicted. Sn (true positive rate) and Sp (true negative rate), respectively,
represent the percentage of positive instances (T35) and the percentage of
negative instances (non-T3S) correctly predicted. An ROC curve is a plot of
Sn versus (1 — sp), and is generated by shifting the decision threshold. AUC
gives a measure of classiﬁer performance. MCC takes into account true and
false positives and false negatives and is generally regarded as a balanced
measure which can be used even if the classes are of very different sizes.

where TP, TN, FF and FN denotes the number of true positives, true negatives,

2.5 Amino acid position shift and frameshift

For position shift test, both insertion and deletion datasets were created.
For deletion test, we generated ﬁve individual datasets with 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5
amino acids deleted respectively at the N-terminal end excluding starting
methionine. For insertion test, one of the 20 amino acids was inserted
before the ﬁrst or second amino acid position respectively for each mutated
sequence, and in total 40 mutated sequences were generated for each T3S or
non-T3S protein. These two positions were selected because apparent Aac
bias was found at the ﬁrst position for non-T3S proteins and at the second
position for T3S proteins. For frameshift experiments, DNA sequences
encoding the ﬁrst 100 amino acids at the N-terminal excluding the starting
methionine were obtained. For each sequence, two mutations with ‘— 1’ and
‘+1’ frameshift were created, respectively. The mutated sequences were
translated into peptides, with all the encountered stop codons replaced with
methionine (Arnold at al., 2009). The resulting sequences were reclassiﬁed
using the optimized BPBAac model.

2.6 Comparison with available methods

The original datasets used for Effective T3 (Arnold at al., 2009) and ANN
(Lower and Schneider, 2009) were collected from the relevant reports. For
Effective T3, no detailed gene accessions or sequences of negative dataset
were available (Arnold at al., 2009), so we randomly selected proteins not
annotated as T3S from different bacteria species as negative training datasets
and ratio of negative to positive samples was 2:1. We also removed some
apparent false positive sequences (e.g. chaperones, ﬂagella proteins, etc.)
from the ANN training dataset. Effective T3 and ANN were implemented
with the optimized parameters suggested by their respective authors (Arnold
at al., 2009; Lower and Schneider, 2009).

2.7 Genome-wide prediction of T3S proteins from
R.solanacearum

The recently validated T3S proteins in R. solanacearum were annotated from
Mukaihara, at al. (2010). In total, 47 validated T3S proteins were retrieved
from GMIlOOO and these validated T3S proteins were also included for the
ﬁnal BPBAac training. For prediction of T3S proteins from GMI proteomes,
3437 chromosome-encoding proteins (Genome ID: NC_OO3295) and 1676
plasmid-encoding proteins (Genome ID: NC_003296) of R.solanacearum
GMIlOOO (Salanoubat at al., 2002) were downloaded from the NCBI genome
database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/genome). The ﬁrst 100 amino
acids (excluding methionine) from the N-terminal end were retrieved from
each protein. The feature vectors were constructed and then tested using the
BPBAac model. The cutoff value of BPBAac was set as 0.5. The proteomes
of Ralstonia were also predicted for T3S protein candidates using Effective
T3 and ANN, respectively with originially optimized parameters.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Distinct position-speciﬁc Aac proﬁles for T3S
effectors

The N-terminal amino acids were retrieved from T3S and non-T3S
proteins, respectively and Aac was calculated for each position.
Signiﬁcantly distinctive Aac proﬁles were found between these two
types of proteins (Fig. 1A and B). For T3S proteins, the 20 types
of amino acids were not evenly distributed at each amino acid

position, especially for the ﬁrst 50 positions (Fig. 1A). Consistent
with previous observation using sequence-based method (Arnold
et al., 2009), serine was enriched in most of the ﬁrst 50 positions.
Contrarily, leucine was found to be selectively enriched in certain
positions, e.g. position l3, l4, 15 etc., but not completely ‘depleted’
as described in an earlier report (Arnold et al., 2009).

The T3S effectors were further split into an animal-pathogen
group and a plant-pathogen group (including Rhizobium, a plant
symbiont). Both groups showed apparent Aac preference proﬁles
different from that of non-T3S proteins (Supplementary Figure SlA
and B). For each position, most of the enriched/depleted amino acids
were similar between two groups, although isoleucine, asparagine
and threonine were more often preferred by animal pathogens
whereas alanine, proline and arginine were more enriched in
plant pathogens (Supplementary Figure SlA andB). We manually
checked the validated T3S effectors for individual genera or
species and found that their overall Aac proﬁles were similar and
apparently different from those in non-T3S proteins (Supplementary
Figure SlC—F).

curves of BPB SVMs based on different lengths of N-terminal sequences.
The curves were based on a 5-fold cross-validation results.

3.2 N-terminal position-speciﬁc Aac features can be
used to classify T3S and non-T3S proteins

In order to further investigate whether this position-speciﬁc Aac
preference is a general feature for T3S effectors, SVM models
were trained for the Aac features (Section 2). Two different SVM
models were trained: (i) SPBAac model that only considers the
Aac proﬁle of positive T3S training dataset; (ii) BPBAac model
considers the Aac proﬁles of both T3S and non-T3S proteins. Table l
and Figure 2A showed that BPB model outperformed SPB model
signiﬁcantly. SPB model achieved high selectivity (94.51%) and
an acceptable sensitivity (71.61%), while BPB model achieved
both high selectivity (97.42%) and high sensitivity (90.97%) in
a 5-fold cross-validation. The accuracy, AUC of ROC curve and
MCC value of BPB were all larger than those of SPB (Table l). The
best predictive power (sensitivity versus selectivity) of established
feature-based T3S protein prediction methods were reported as 71%
versus 85%, 74% versus 98% and 65% versus 91% for Effective T3,
ANN and SSE-ACC, respectively (Arnold et al., 2009; Lower and
Schneider, 2009; Yang et al., 2010). Therefore, the position-speciﬁc
amino acid proﬁles can serve as independent and effective features
for T3S and non-T3S protein classiﬁcation. The fact that BPB model
outperformed SPB model indicates the important contribution of the
negative training data.

Previous computational modeling studies showed that T3S signals
were mainly located within the ﬁrst 30 or 25 amino acid positions
(Arnold et al., 2009; Lower and Schneider, 2009). In order to

optimize the length of signal sequence, BPB models were retrained
and compared using N-terminal sequences containing the ﬁrst 25, 30,
40, 50 and 100 amino acid positions, respectively (named BPBAac-
N25, N30, N50 and N100 model, respectively). As shown by the
ROC curves, model using N-terminal 25 or 30 positions achieved
good performance (Fig. 2B), although the best performance was
achieved when the ﬁrst 100 amino acid were used (Fig. 2B). From
this analysis, we conclude that sequences beyond the ﬁrst 30 amino
acids also contain important signals to guide protein secretion. Other
optimized parameters, such as kernel function, gamma and cost
values, were also tested (Table l).

3.3 The robustness of BPBAac model

The robustness of BPBAac model was examined by (i) randomly
selecting sub-datasets with different sample sizes from the training
data to retrain the model and to classify the remaining data; and
(ii) using the Leave-One-Out strategy. Speciﬁcally, T3S effectors
and non-T3S proteins from one bacterial genus were eliminated
from the test dataset, and then the remaining data were used to
train the model and to classify the testing dataset. This process
was repeated using different bacteria genus. Our results showed that
models trained using different sub-datasets also performed equally
well, and no apparent reduction in performance was observed even
when only 40% of the original training data were used (Fig. 3A). For
different genera or subgroups, most of the effectors could be recalled
and the AUC values did not show signiﬁcant change (Fig. 3B). Taken
together, the position-speciﬁc Aac proﬁles were important features
for T3S protein identiﬁcation in different bacteria species.

3.4 Aac feature alone is enough to distinguish T3S and
non-T3S proteins

The Sse and Ace of N-terminal amino acids have also been reported
as useﬁil features to distinguish T3S proteins from non-T3S ones
(Yang et al., 2010). In order to examine whether these two features
can improve the classifying performance of BPBAac, Sse and Acc
BPB features were extracted and trained individually. In addition,
models were retrained using combinations of any two types or all
three types of features, respectively. The results showed that neither
Sse nor Acc was able to improve the performance (Fig. 4). Therefore,
although T3S proteins contain Sse and Acc proﬁles different from
those of non-T3S proteins (data available on request), the Aac feature
alone is enough to distinguish T3S and non-T3S proteins.

3.5 Some T3S effectors contain N-terminal
position-speciﬁc Aac features that can tolerate
position shifts and frameshifts

Some T3S effectors may contain amino acid insertions/deletions,
which lead to position shift in the signal regions. For example,
various forms of amino acid deletions or insertions were found in
XopO, a T3S protein, from different Xanthomonas strains. When
the BPBAac model was applied to two XopO homologs which bear
amino acid position shift, both were correctly classiﬁed. To examine
whether the Aac feature is sensitive to amino acid position shifts,
deletions and insertions were introduced to T3S or non-T3S proteins,
respectively. As shown in Table 2, after introduction of position shifts
(amino acid deletion), ~50% of the T3S proteins retained their Aac

position. For these two types of insertion mutations, similar
proportion of proteins were correctly reclassiﬁed (53 and 55%
for ﬁrst and second, respectively) (Table 2). The reclassifying
performance was also inﬂuenced by the type of amino acid inserted.
As non-T3S proteins show signiﬁcant amino acid preference at the
ﬁrst position, insertion of non-T3S proteins preferred amino acid
(e.g. ‘S’ or ‘K”) resulted in higher selectivity. On the other hand,
T3S proteins showed signiﬁcant amino acid preference at the second
position, and insertion of T3S protein preferred amino acid (e.g. ‘I”
or ‘N”) resulted in higher sensitivity (data not shown).

As some T3S effectors are insensitive to frameshifts, some
researchers have argued that the signals may locate within the
mRNA sequences rather than the amino acid sequences (Mudgett
et al., 2000; Ramamurthi and Schneewind, 2003; Riissmann et al.,
2002). It was recently suggested that few effectors (10%) maintain
sequence-based Aac proﬁles when frameshifts occur (Arnold et al.,
2009). To test whether the position-speciﬁc Aac feature is sensitive
to frameshift, we created frameshifts (both ‘—1” and ‘+l”shifts)
for both T3S and non-T3S proteins. It was found that ~13% and
~93% of frarneshifted T3S and non-T3S were correctly classiﬁed
by BPBAac, respectively (Table 2). Non-T3S proteins were more
insensitive to frameshift is likely due to the fact that such proteins
contain much fewer amino acid preference features (Fig. 1B). Some
T3S effectors such as AvrBs2 of Xanthomonas, that are known to
be tolerant to frameshifts in this research have also been conﬁrmed
by wet-lab experiments (Mudgett et al., 2000).

3.6 Performance comparison with current prediction
models

The classiﬁcation performance was compared among BPBAac,
EffectiveT3 and T3SS ANN. First, EffectiveT3 and ANN were used
to reclassify the training datasets used in this research (‘BPBAac
dataset”), and the performance was compared with cross-validation
rates of BPBAac. Supplementary Table S1 and Figure 5A clearly
demonstrated that BPBAac outperformed these two methods in

To make a fair comparison among different models, other two
strategies were adopted: (i) BPBAac was ﬁrst retrained using the
EffectiveT3 dataset and ANN dataset respectively before it was used
to reclassify BPBAac dataset (Supplementary Table S1 and Fig. 5B);
(ii) BPBAac was retrained using the datasets adopted by EffectiveT3
and ANN respectively, and the new model was used to reclassify
those two datasets (Supplementary Table S1). As shown in Table S1
and Figure 5, BPBAac model consistently performed better than
Effective T3 and ANN.

3.7 Genome-wide prediction of T3S effectors in
R.solanacearum

Ralstonia solanacearum is a very important pathogenic bacterium
that causes severe bacterial wilt to a wide range of potential host
plants, including crop and fruit plants. Currently, the information
about the T3S effectors in this genus is limited. As an application
of the BPBAac model, proteins encoded by chromosome and
plasmid of R.s0lanacearum GM11000 were used for genome-
wide prediction of T3S proteins. As shown in Supplementary
Table S2, 1.4% (49/3437) chromosome encoding proteins and 2.9%
(48/1676) of plasmid encoding proteins were predicted to be T3S

effectors. With a higher recall percentage, a much smaller number of
putative T3S candidates was obtained, making validation work more
feasible (Table 3). Interestingly, many candidates (38/97, 39.2%) are
annotated as ‘hypothetical’ proteins with unknown function. Some
candidates were validated recently (e.g. PopFl), closely related
with T3SS (e.g. NP_522416.1, Hrp pilus subunit HRPY protein)
or originated in bacteriophages (e.g. NP_519819.1) (Supplementary
Table S2).

4 DISCUSSION

Previous studies have demonstrated that T3S effectors contain
conserved N-terminal Aac pattern. For example, Lloyd et al. (2002)
found that serine and isoleucine were enriched at the N-termini
of YopE protein. Petnicki-chieja et al. (2002) reported two
consensus patterns (i.e. enrichment and deletion) at the N-terminal
end of Pseudomonas Hrp-secreted proteins and a group of new
T3S effectors were identiﬁed based on these patterns. Recently,
Samudrala et al. (2009) examined sequence-based Aac bias and
concluded that the Aac proﬁles were ‘largely uninformative”. In
this study, we carefully examined the position-speciﬁc Aac proﬁles
within the N-terminal sequences of T3S and non-T3S proteins and
identiﬁed distinctive amino acid enrichment/depletion proﬁles for
T3S proteins. We found that although the ﬁrst 30 N-terminal amino
acid positions are most informative, important signal information
were also embedded within the sequences beyond the ﬁrst 30
positions. Using a Bi-proﬁle Bayesian model, we extracted the
position-speciﬁc Aac feature within the ﬁrst 100 amino acid position
and used it as an efﬁcient classiﬁer to distinguish T3S from
non-T3S proteins. Our model achieved great predictive power
and was superior to previous models using sequence-based Aac
features. Apart from Effective T3 and ANN, we also compared the
BPBAac model with SIEVE, one of the earliest prediction methods
adopting sequence-based features (Samudrala et al., 2009) and the
BPBAac model also performed better (Supplementary Table S3).
Further exploration of the position-based Aac features may provide
important clues about the nature and evolution of the T3SS signals.

Apart from Aac, other features may also contribute to the
mechanisms underlying T3S secretion. Previously, other groups
have examined Sse and Acc (Arnold et al., 2009; Yang et.al.,
2010) but no conclusive remarks can be drawn so far. Arnold
et al. (2009) found that neither Sse, nor Acc could improve the
classifying performance. Using a combinative feature extraction
strategy, Yang et al. (2010) found that the combination of Sse and
Acc could improve the model performance. In the present study,
we did ﬁnd distinctive Sse and Acc proﬁles between positive and
negative dataset. However, when individually trained using Sse and
Acc, the model failed to show good performance (sensitivity versus

selectivity for Sse and Acc, respectively were: 47% versus 79%,
16% versus 99%; data not shown). When these two features were
combined with Aac, the performance was signiﬁcantly decreased
(Fig. 4). Further, detailed analysis is being carried out to investigate
the most relevant positions more exposed to the solvent and their Sse
organization, and to predict the disorder of these structural regions.
Such analysis may provide insights into whether and how Sse and
Acc may contribute to the speciﬁc secretion of T3S proteins.

Two methods are frequently adopted for position-speciﬁc Aac
modeling: Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and sliding window
technique. As T3S proteins contain a long signal bearing sequence,
the sliding window model may become quite complex and
sometimes encounter the overﬁtting problem (Lower and Schneider,
2009). We have also attempted a T3S protein HMM (Eddy, 1998),
but found its classifying performance inferior (data not shown). The
BPB model was ﬁrst proposed by Shao et al. (2009), and it has
been successﬁilly used to predict protein phosphorylation sites. One
main advantage of the BPB model is that it considers the features
of both positive and negative training samples. Compared to sliding
windows and HMMs concerning amino acid insertion, deletion or
match, an underlying drawback of our position-based Aac model
(BPBAac) is that amino acid insertions or deletions were neglected.
Unexpectedly, our model performed very effectively despite this
potential drawback. After a careful examination of homologous
T3S effectors from closely related bacterial strains, we found that
insertions or deletions within the ﬁrst 100 N-terminal positions
were very rare. Only one protein, XopO from Xanthomonas, was
found to have two homologs (GenBank accession: AAV74207.1 and
CAJ22686.1) with nine amino acid deletions/insertions, and both
homologs were correctly classiﬁed. Interestingly, a large portion
(~50%) of T3S proteins exhibit distinct position-speciﬁc Aac
features that can tolerate position shifts. We therefore hypothesize
that position shifts seldom happen within the signal sequences
of T3S proteins; and in the case that they happen, many T3S
proteins manage to maintain the original Aac features. This may
partially explain the high performance of the BPBAac model where
position shift was not taken into consideration. Together with the
observation in this research that some T3S proteins (~13%) could
resist frameshifts generated in the signal region, we presume that
bacteria may adopt strategies at both protein and mRNA levels to
resist the negative mutations that may destroy T3S signals during
the course of evolution.

Finally, we applied the BPBAac model to make a genome-
wide prediction of T3S effectors in an important plant pathogen,
R. solanacearum GM11000. Most of the validated T3S effectors were
recalled by BPBAac (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S1). More
importantly, far fewer candidates were predicted by BPBAac than by
other models such as ANN and Effective T3 (Table 3). A signiﬁcant
proportion of the predictions overlapped with those of ANN and
Effective T3, indicating they are most likely true T3S proteins,
while a large number were ‘hypothetical’ proteins with unknown
function. These candidates are especially interesting because they
have so far received little attention. One candidate, PopFl, had been
validated as T3S effector protein but not included in our training
dataset (Meyer et al., 2006). Another candidate, NP_522416.1, was
a Hrp pilus subunit HRPY protein, which could be possibly secreted
via T3SS conduit. In addition, one of these candidates originated in
bacteriophages. It is known that some T3S proteins originate from
phages, such as SopE in Salmonella. Further experiments are being

carried out to validate some of the newly predicted T3S proteins.
We hope that the list of newly identiﬁed putative T3S candidates
may serve as a useﬁil resource for the research community. As the
Aac features were commonly identiﬁed across genus and species,
we believe that the BPBAac tool can be widely used for efﬁcient
T3S effector prediction in various bacteria species.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The ancestor of birds and mammals lived approximately
300 million years ago. Inferring its genome organization is key to
understanding the differentiated evolution of these two lineages.
However, detecting traces of its chromosomal organization in its
extant descendants is difficult due to the accumulation of molecular
evolution since birds and mammals lineages diverged.

Results: We address several methodological issues for the detection
and assembly of ancestral genomic features of ancient vertebrate
genomes, which encompass adjacencies, contiguous segments,
syntenies and double syntenies in the context of a whole genome
duplication. Using generic, but stringent, methods for all these
problems, some of them new, we analyze 15 vertebrate genomes,
including 12 amniotes and 3 teleost fishes, and infer a high-resolution
genome organization of the amniote ancestral genome, composed of
39 ancestral linkage groups at a resolution of 100 kb. We extensively
discuss the validity and robustness of the method to variations of
data and parameters. We introduce a support value for each of the
groups, and show that 36 out of 39 have maximum support.
Conclusions: Single methodological principle cannot currently be
used to infer the organization of the amniote ancestral genome, and
we demonstrate that it is possible to gather several principles into a
computational paleogenomics pipeline. This strategy offers a solid
methodological base for the reconstruction of ancient vertebrate
genomes.

1 INTRODUCTION

The reconstruction of ancestral karyotypes and gene orders from
homologies between extant species contributes to understanding the
large-scale evolutionary mutations that led to current genomes from
their last common ancestor. For example, given ancestral genomes or
gene orders, distances and evolutionary scenarios between genomes
can be computed along branches of the considered phylogenetic
tree (Miklos and Tannier, 2010) and not only between pairs of
extant species. More generally, one can hope to work within an

‘evolutionary framework combining ancestral and extant genomes
in a robust phylogenetic tree’ (Muffato and Roest-Crollius, 2008).

The ancestral reconstruction problem has been approached
for eukaryotic genomes using cytogenetics techniques pioneered
by Dobzhansky and Sturtevant (1938) and recently applied to
mammalian genomes (Froenicke, 2005; Froenicke et (11., 2003;
Richard et (11., 2003; Wienberg, 2004; Yang et (11., 2003). However,
when dealing with older ancestors and larger evolutionary distances,
homologies are less visible by cytogenetics methods. It is only
with the recent availability of sequenced and assembled genomes
that bioinformatics methods can handle the problem of predicting
the deep past of metazoan chromosomes [reviews by Faraut
(2008); Muffato and Roest-Crollius (2008); Rascol et (11. (2007)].
These methods address the problem at a higher resolution than
cytogenetics techniques, as they require assembled genomes, either
fully or at least in large contigs and scaffolds. The results
obtained on mammalian genomes, based on genome rearrangement
models (Alekseyev and Pevzner, 2009; Bourque et (11., 2004;
Murphy et (11., 2005) or on physical mapping methods (Chauve and
Tannier, 2008; Kemkemer et (11., 2009; Ma et (11., 2006; Mikkelsen
et (11., 2007; Muffato et (11., 2010), slowly converge toward the
cytogenetics ones (Ferguson-Smith and Trifonov, 2007).

Prospective methods have attempted the reconstruction of more
ancient animal proto-genomes: amniotes (Kohn et (11., 2006;
Nakatani et (11., 2007), bony ﬁshes (Catchen et (11., 2008; Jaillon
et (11., 2004; Woods et (11., 2005), vertebrates (Kohn et (11., 2006;
Nakatani et (11., 2007; Naruse et (11., 2004), chordates (Putnam
et (11., 2008) or even eumetazoa (Putnam et (11., 2007). However,
the accuracy of these ad hoc methodologies has not been studied
as thoroughly as for more generic methods. The ability of the
latter to produce reliable results on mammalian or yeast genomes
was evaluated either by comparisons to cytogenetics or manual
reconstructions (Chauve and Tannier, 2008; Chauve et (11., 2010).
The validation of the results is indeed a major issue, since ancient
genomes can not be sequenced due to DNA decay. Simulations,
although used in a few studies (Bertrand et (11., 2010; Ma et (11., 2006;
Muffato et (11., 2010), face the currently limited understanding of
large-scale evolutionary processes such as genome rearrangements
and gene losses following a Whole Genome Duplication (WGD).
Cytogenetic results or manual reconstructions are not available for
very ancient genomes.

The goal of the present work is to propose a general methodology
for inferring ancestral genome segments and linkage groups, based
on several comparative genomics principles grouped into a physical
mapping framework. The framework we describe can be applied
to any ancestral species following the speciation from the teleost

ﬁshes (tetrapods, sarcopterigians, for example), provided sequenced
extant genomes from two branches descending from an ancestor are
available. We apply it to the ancestral amniote genome. We study
the validity and robustness of the method and results, and we argue
that it is possible to evaluate an ancestral genome reconstruction
based on the careful examination of the underlying principles of the
method.

These principles are: (i) the detection of ancestral features
(adjacencies, collinear or contiguous segments, syntenic groups)
based on their conservation in the extant genomes; and (ii) the
assembly of such features into ancestral chromosomal segments
and linkage groups. Hence, we design the reconstruction process
as a pipeline decomposed into several phases, each focused on
the detection/assembly of a speciﬁc kind of ancestral genomic
feature. This requires to deﬁne, for each such phase, an appropriate
combinatorial representation of the corresponding assembled
ancestral features, including PQ-trees to represent contiguous
ancestral regions as in Bergeron et (11. (2004); Chauve and
Tannier (2008); Ma et (11. (2006) and graphs to represent ancestral
linkage groups (ALGs), as in Muffato et (11. (2010). The ﬁnal
representation of an ancestral genome is a nested combination of
such combinatorial objects.

We apply this pipeline to reconstruct the amniote ancestral
genome at a 100kb resolution, tailoring the method to account
for the phylogeny and presence of a whole genome duplication
at the base of the teleost lineage (Fig. 1). We obtain 39 ALGS,
covering a signiﬁcant part of the extant amniote genomes, which
is a improvement on the two previous studies of this ancestral
genome (Kohn et (11., 2006; Nakatani et (11., 2007). The syntenic
associations between extant amniote chromosomes that we predict
conﬁrm three associations found in previous studies, but also include
two new ones. We discuss the accuracy of the results produced by
our method, and the robustness of the method to variations of data
and parameters.

2 METHODS

We give a generic description of the different objects. and call A the ancestral
Species. identiﬁed by an internal node in a SpecieS phylogeny. of which we
reconstruct the genome. Descendants Of A are the ingroup Species. and all
otherS are the outgroups. An informative pair of SpecieS is composed of two
extant Species whose evolutionary path in the phylogenetic tree contains A.

Ancestral blocks: we use orthologous genomic segments among ingroup
genomes to derive ancestral genomic blocks. An ancestral block represents
an oriented ancestral genome segment that evolved into a unique genomic
segment in each extant genome. with limited internal rearrangements and
point mutations. and that was not involved in a large-scale duplication. These
ancestral blocks represent the basic bricks of the ancestral genome. They are
constructed using Ensembl Compara multiple alignments (Paten et al.. 2008)
as seeds. A block result from joining seeds collinear in all ingroup genomes. if
it spans at least min_len = 100 kb in all ingroup genomes (see Supplementary
Material).

Contiguous ancestral regions: we assemble ancestral blockS into contiguous
ancestral regions (CARs) (Chauve and Tannier. 2008; Ma et al.. 2006).
CARS are groups of ancestral blocks with partial ordering information. To
this aim. we detect conserved contiguity Signal in amniote extant genomes:
maximum common intervals. conserved adjacencies and adjacencies inferred
from reliable rearrangements.

Ancestral synteny graph ana1 ALGs: next. we cluSter the CARS by
constructing the ancestral synteny graph (ASG). CARS are linked by
detecting a Signiﬁcant conserved synteny Signal between pairS of blocks.
including a double synteny Signal when a WGD separates the compared
extant SpecieS. ALGS are deﬁned aS connected components of the ASG. after
edgeS with weaker support have been discarded.

2.1 Computing CARS

Concepts and methods to construct and represent CARS are extensively
described in Chauve and Tannier (2008); Chauve et a1. (2010). and we review
them brieﬂy here. We consider the extremities (head and tail) of the ancestral
blocks that we call ancestral markers. Using the extremities of the blocks
aS markers iS necessary to infer the ancestral orientation of each ancestral
block.

Ancestral contiguous sets: for a given ancestral genome A. an ancestral
contiguous set (ACS) iS a set of ancestral markers that are believed to be
contiguous in A. with no prior information on their order along the ancestral
chromosome that contained them. An ACS with two markers iS called an
adjacency. We consider four typeS of ACS:

0 Block adjacencies. deﬁned aS pair of extremities of a same ancestral
block. The two markers composing a block adjacency are adjacent in
all genomes.

0 Supported adjacencies. deﬁned aS pairS of markers that are adjacent in
both genomes of an informative pair.

0 Maximal common intervals between both genomes of an informative
pair. A maximal common interval between two genomes iS a set of
markers that are contiguous in both genomes (possibly with different
orderS) and iS not included into another common interval between the
same two genomes.

0 Reliable adjacencies. deﬁned aS adjacencies that can be inferred from
probable genome rearrangements (Chauve et al.. 2010; Zhao and
Bourque. 2009).

Assembling ACS into CARs: an ordering of all the markers satisﬁes a given
ACS S if the markers of S form a contiguous interval in thiS ordering. A set
of ACS S iS said to be in conﬂict if there iS no total ordering of the ancestral
markers which satisﬁes all ACS of S. For example. if x. y and z are ancestral
markers and {x, y}. {x,z}. {z, y} are three ACS. then there iS no total ordering
of x. y and z such that the markers in each of the three pairS are contiguous.
If a set of ACS iS not in conﬂict. all the orderings which satisfy them can
be represented by a Structure called a PQ-tree (Booth and Lueker. 1976).
widely used in physical mapping StudieS. A PQ-tree deﬁnes CARS. from
which it iS possible to order. at leaSt partially. ancestral markers. If a set of
ACS iS in conﬂict. then each ACS iS weighted according to itS conservation
in extant genomes (see Supplementary Material). and CARS are obtained
from the subset of non-conﬂicting ACS with the highest summed weight.

and Stickleback (Gacu): each box is a DCS. with the top (respectively bottom)

number appears above (respectively below) the box.

We ensure all block adjacencies are conserved by giving them a high weight
that prevents them from being discarded [See Chauve and Tannier (2008)
for a precise description].

2.2 Regrouping CARS into the ASG

The contiguity condition used to deﬁne ACSS and compute CARS is
too stringent to deﬁne purely syntenic features of an ancestral genome.
Indeed. some groups of markers may have been kept syntenic (on the same
chromosome) during evolution. but Spread out along this chromosome by
genome rearrangements. Also. assembly errors. related to contigs ordering
for example. can lead to an apparent loss of contiguity between group of
syntenic markers. It is then necessary to relax the condition of contiguity in
order to detect more subtle homology Signal from the comparison of extant
genomes composing an informative pair. We describe below two ways to
detect such Signal.

AS the ancestral blocks we constructed are limited to the ingroups and we
want to detect syntenies common to ingroups and outgroups as well. we use
orthologous genes retrieved from Ensembl Compara [Vilella et a1. (2009).
see Supplementary Material] to detect the syntenic Signal.

Ancestral synteny: for a given informative pair (A,B) in which no Species
is involved in a whole genome duplication. a contiguous sets of autosomal
markers (CSAM) (Kumar et al.. 2001) is a set 0 of contiguous genes of A.
such that all their orthologs are in a same chromosome in B. The set 0 of
genes is called an ancestral synteny if its conservation in B is Statistically
Signiﬁcant according to a test described in Durand and Sankoff (2003) (see
Supplementary Material for a detailed description of the tests and the controls
for multiple testing).

To detect CSAMS. we use informative pairs whereA is a bird genome and
B is a therian genome. or conversely.

Double ancestral synteny: for a given informative pairs (A,B) for which
a whole genome duplication happened in the lineage of B. we expect to
see a set of genes that Span one segment in A and their orthologs Span two
segments in B (Fig. 2).

The general principle deﬁning double syntenies is relatively Simple. but
due to different patterns of genome rearrangements and gene losses following
a WGD (Hufton and Panopoulou. 2009). it has been applied with different ad
hoc implementations in vertebrates (J aillon et al.. 2004; Pham and Pevzner,
2010; Sémon and Wolfe. 2007c). plants (de Peer. 2004) or yeasts (Dietrich
et al.. 2004; Kellis et al.. 2004). We are not aware of any formal notion of
double synteny. It is a contribution of the present method to propose such
a formalization. which can be used widely in any clade of the living world
where we know whole genome duplications happened (yeasts or plants).
We use a generalization of the gene teams deﬁned in Luc et a1. (2003). An
ot—B-double team is a set 0 of genes that Span one segment SA in A and
two segments S}; and S2, in B. such that. along SA (respectively S23. S2,).
there is no gap of Size greater than 01 (respectively B). The set 0 of genes is
called a double conserved synteny (DCS) if its conservations in A and B are

Statistically Signiﬁcant. and if there is no Signiﬁcantly clustered segment S2,
in B. disjoint from S23, and S2,. which has orthologs in SA.

This deﬁnition relies on two parameters (the gaps parameters 01 and B)
which can vary to include a ﬂexibility to noisy data as well as a high post-
WDG rearrangement rate in B. We choose the parameters maximizing the
coverage of A by DCS (due to forbidding the presence of a segment S2, and
the use of Statistical tests. the coverage can decrease when 01 increases).

With our data. the parameters maximizing the coverage of extant anmiote
genomes by DCS are 01:1. accounting for possible isolated wrong gene
annotation or retro-transpositions for example. and B = 00. which matches the
high rate of rearrangement after the teleost WGD (Hufton and Panopoulou.
2009; Sémon and Wolfe. 2007b). Supplementary Figure S3 Shows the
coverage of the chicken genome by DCS with different values of 01 and B.

Assembling ancestral syntenies into the ASG: if two blocks b1 and b; are
contained in a same genome segment of an ingroup which is involved either
in an ancestral synteny or a double ancestral synteny. then b1 and b; are
believed to have been syntenic in the ancestral genome A. Since. each block
belongs to a CAR. then we get a set of synteny relationships between CARS.
This naturally motivates the representation of a set of ancestral syntenies as a
graph. whose vertices are the CARS. and where there is an edge between two
vertices C1 and C; if C 1 (respectively C2) contains a block b1 (respectively
b2) such that b1 and b2 both belong to an ingroup genome segment that is
involved in an ancestral or double ancestral synteny. We call this graph the
Ancestral Synteny Graph; a connected component of this graph represents a
set of CARS that are assumed to belong to a same proto-chromosome. and
we call it an ALG (with no additional information on the ordering of the
CARS along this proto-chromosome).

Due to the relaxed notion of conservation used to deﬁne the edges of the
ASG (contiguity is enforced in a Single genome) and the larger evolutionary
distance between ingroups and outgroups. the risk of convergent evolution
or inaccurate ancestral syntenies is higher. To account for this issue. edges
can be examined individually and ﬁltered. using phylogenetic support. DCS
Statistical support or alignment quality between blocks for example.

3 RESULTS

We implemented all the principles described above and analyzed
a dataset containing 12 amniote genomes (human, chimpanzee,
orangutan, macaca, mouse, rat, dog, cow, horse, opossum, zebra
ﬁnch, chicken) and 3 teleost ﬁsh genomes (tetraodon, Stickleback,
medaka). The 12 amniote genomes were chosen because they
were assembled and present in a multiple alignments of 16
amniote genomes available in the release 58 of the Ensembl
database obtained using Pecan (Paten et (11., 2008). All data
(multiple alignments of amniote genomes, gene contents and gene
trees) were downloaded from the Ensembl 58 Compara database
(Vilella et (11., 2009).

The phylogeny, including branch lengths, was taken from
paleontological data (Benton and Donoghue, 2007) (Fig. 1). Branch
lengths are deﬁned to be the normalized lower bounds of speciation
times given by paleontological evidences, in order to avoid any (1
priori hypotheses b, on rearrangement rates.

We computed ancestral blocks with resolution min_len= 100 kb,
and we obtained 773 ancestral blocks, together with their
orientations in the amniote genomes, resulting in 1546 ancestral
markers (two markers per block, one for each extremity).

3.1 Amniote contiguous ancestral regions and ALGS

We detected 1861 ACS: 773 block adjacencies, 457 supported
adjacencies, 8 reliable adjacencies and 623 maximum common
intervals. We discarded 10 of these ACS (2 supported adjacencies,

3 reliable adjacencies and 5 maximum common intervals) to obtain
a non-conﬂicting set of ACS that resulted in 164 CARS. The low
number of reliable adjacencies, when compared with mammalian
studies (Zhao and Bourque, 2009), is probably due to the large
evolutionary distance between birds and therians and illustrates
the less clear rearrangement signal that can be detected at this
evolutionary scale.

We then computed the CSAMs, the DCSs and the ASG using
the gene orthologies from Ensembl 58. We retained only edges of
the ASG with a strong phylogenetic support: a pair of ancestral
blocks deﬁnes an edge between two CARS in the the ASG if
and only if both blocks belong to an amniote segment involved
in an ancestral synteny or double ancestral synteny, and both
blocks are syntenic in genomes of at least three clades of the
four amniote clades we considered: birds, opossum, laurasiatheria
(cow, horse, dog), euarchontoglire (primates and rodents). This
resulted in 39 connected components representing putative amniote
linkage groups, partially depicted on Figure 3 (See Supplementary
Information for the whole ASG picture).

The largest connected components mainly consists of two or three
very dense graphs linked through a few number of CARS.

A ﬁner analysis of the contribution of each type of signal we
considered (adjacencies, common intervals, ancestral syntenies and
double syntenies) shows several interesting properties. First CARS
are mostly deﬁned by common intervals (common intervals only
deﬁne 165 CARS). The impact of adjacencies is then more in
ordering blocks within CARS. Second, most connected components
of the ASG are due to edges induced by CSAMs: discarding the DCS
would result in 44 connected components. However, all syntenic
associations are due the very few edges (24) edges induced uniquely
by DCS. Details are provided in Supplementary Material.

3.2 Structure of the amniote ancestral genome

We say a region of an extant genome is covered by an amniote ALG if
all blocks contained in this region belong to the ALG. The ancestral
groups we inferred cover 972 Mb (94%) of the chicken genome
and 2540 Mb (83%) of the human genome. In terms of genes, they
cover 13996 (91%) of the chicken genes, and 15628 (76%) of the
human genes. This coverage of the chicken and human genomes
is much higher than what was attained by previous studies (Kohn
et al., 2006; Nakatani et al., 2007) (Table 1 and Supplemental
Material). The study of Muffato et al. (2010), while attaining a
similar coverage, gives a much more fragmented conﬁguration
(606 ancestral segments with >1 gene for the amniote genome) as it
uses more genomes, but only adjacencies to infer ancestral features.

To push ﬁirther the comparison with the previous proposals for the
ancestral amniote genome (Kohn et al., 2006; Nakatani et al., 2007),
we use features of the reconstructions called syntenic associations.
A syntenic association is the presence in a proto-chromosome
(a single component of the ancestral synteny graph), of blocks from
two different chromosomes of an amniote extant genome chosen
as reference. In Table 2, we report all syntenic associations we
detected on the chicken genome, as well as the ones reported by two
previous studies [Muffato et al. (2010) do not propose any syntenic
association].

3.3 Robustness

Our method relies on few parameters. Among them, the ones that
deﬁne the DCS are optimized to get a maximum coverage of amniote
genomes (Supplementary Fig. S3). Their variation is then part of the

construction process, so we did not include them in the robustness
analyses.

Instead we made the set of sampled species and the resolution
parameter min_len (the minimum length of a block) vary. We
considered 11 variations of the set of amniote genomes obtained
by either retaining all the 12 genomes or discarding 1 of the 10 non-
reference genomes (all genomes except human and chicken). Four
variations of the set of teleost ﬁsh genomes were also considered
by either retaining all the three genomes or discarding one of them.
The parameter min_len varied from 50 to 500 kb by steps of 50kb,
leading to 10 variations. In total, we performed 11 ><4>< 10:440
different experiments.

The number of ALGS is quite stable: it ranges from 34 to 47, with
most situations resulting in 36—39 ALGS (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Interestingly, Supplementary Figure S4 shows the stability of the
number of CARs, which is much less visible. Again, this shows
the interest of the integrative method, since each feature can be
unstable while the whole is not (see a discussion on this in the
Supplementary Material). We then wanted to know how much
these ALGS from different runs looked alike. For this, we randomly
selected 100 000 pairs of chicken genes, and ﬁltered those covered
by blocks in all 440 experiments. For each such pair of genes, we
recorded the number of situations over the 440 ones in which they
belong to two different ALGS (Fig. 4). We observe two predominant
modes at 0-49 and 400-440. Because of the small probability to
randomly select two genes that are in the same ALG, the 0-49 mode
is obviously smaller, but this shows a relative constance in the
choices to group genome parts or not. Indeed, a perfectly robust
method would show only values 0 and 440, whereas a non-robust
one would have a dispersed signal.

We then evaluated the robustness of the result we present, that
is, the ALGS computed with all genomes and a resolution of
min_len=100 kb. Again, we sampled a high number of pairs of genes
belonging to blocks in all 440 runs. Then for each particular ALG,
we recorded the number of runs in which both genes still belong to
a same ALG. The results are shown in Figure 5.

In this ﬁgure, each column represent the stability of an ALG A.
A bold dot marks the mean of the distribution of the number of
runs (over 440) in which two genes belonging to A are in a same
ALG. Among the 39 ALGs, 33 have a perfect stability, meaning

Three ALGS show a bad stability, with a support between 0.2 and

the 100 kb resolution. The number of low supported ALGS decreases
with the resolution. In Supplementary Figure S6, the same analysis
is reproduced for min_len = 500 kb. All 32 ALGS in this case have
a support > 90%, and 30 of them have 100%. This suggests there is
a trade-off between the resolution and the support of the results.

4 DISCUSSION

We described a general methodology for inferring ancestral
genomes, that relies on a hierarchical process: computing ancestral
blocks, computing CARs and computing the ASG and ALGS. We
implemented this general approach using stringent methods for
each phase, tailored to account for the speciﬁcity of the evolution
of amniote genomes, and we applied it to infer large ancestral
amniote linkage groups at a 100 kb resolution, from whole-genome
alignments and gene families. This resulted in the ﬁrst proposal of
an ancestral amniote genome that covers large parts of its extant
descendants.

4.1 Comparison with previous ancestral amniote
genomes

Kohn et al. (2006) and Nakatani et al. (2007) proposed signiﬁcantly
more amniote syntenic associations than we do. One explanation
is the stringency of the method we use to detect double ancestral
syntenies. Indeed, due to the stability of bird genomes and the
absence of reptile genomes in the considered dataset, the only
syntenic associations that can be detected are supported by double
ancestral syntenies. We ﬁnd that the associations 18-27 and Z-22
are the only ones to be supported by a pair of blocks that belong
to more than one DCS. This illustrates the fact that combinatorial
traces of synteny conservation at a large evolutionary distance are
quite degraded and not widespread, even when several amniote
genomes are considered. Even if we cannot deﬁnitively argue that
the syntenic associations described in the previous ancestral genome
proposals are wrong, we believe that they rely on a weaker synteny
conservation signal as illustrated by the case of the putative syntenic
association 17-Z (see discussion below). We even found no evidence
that the medaka genome is as stable as claimed by Nakatani et al.
(2007) (for example, Fig. 2 does not show more conserved DCS
signal in the medaka than in the two other teleost ﬁshes).

We now discuss a few examples of syntenic associations that
were reported by both (Kohn et al., 2006; Nakatani et al., 2007) but
not by our method, as they illustrate the interest of methodological
discussions to analyze such discrepancies. The association between
chicken chromosomes 26 and 32 was out of reach for us as no
ancestral block did belong to chicken chromosome 32. The signal
we observe for an association between chicken chromosomes 2 and
9 does not support clearly the fact it was present in the amniote
ancestor: it can be related to two ancestral blocks, contiguous in
all placental mammalian genomes but not in the opossum genome,
and that do not belong to a DCS, which indicates more likely an
ancestral boreoeutherian feature. Finally, the case of the association
17-Z is interesting. We detect a faint signal for it based on three
blocks present on a single DCS in the macaca genome and on
the same chromosomes in the human, chimpanzee and orangutan
genomes, but which does not satisfy the phylogenetic conservation
criterion we use to retain edges of the ASG. There are also two
blocks contiguous in all placental marnmalians and that also belong
to a genome segment that shows a DCS signal that does not satisfy
the stringent deﬁnition we used. So we leave open the possibility that
the association 17-Z is present in the amniote ancestral genome. The
signal related to associations 2-9 and 3-14, as well as for associations
Z-22 and 1-2, which are speciﬁc to our study, is described in
Supplementary Material.

4.2 Insights on the evolution of bird genomes

It can be remarked in Table 3 that the ancestral amniote linkage
groups we inferred are remarkably close to the bird chromosomes,
and somehow more distant from the mammalian ones.

It has already been remarked that bird genomes show an incredibly
conserved degree of synteny (Backstrom et al., 2008; Consortium,
2004; Ellegren, 2010; Grifﬁn et al., 2007, 2008; Hansson et al., 2010;
Skinner et al., 2009; Stapley et al., 2008). It has been claimed that the
avian ancestral karyotype is only one ﬁssion away from the chicken
one, concerning chicken chromosome 4. Our analysis, that splits
chicken chromosome 4 into three ancestral linkage groups, including
two small and one large segments (1.7, 5 and 41 Mb, respectively),
does not contradict this hypothesis. Grifﬁn et al. (2007) place
the appearance of micro-chromosomes after the divergence with
mammals, since no mammal seems to carry some, but the fact
that most chicken micro-chromosomes each belong to a single
ALG, leaves open the hypothesis of ancestral micro-chromosomes:
apart from the 18-27, 21-26 and Z-22 ﬁssions, which concern at
least one micro-chromosome each, all micro-chromosomes could
be ancestral. Even the groups 18-27 and 21-26 can be considered as
ancestral micro-chromosomes.

4.3 Methodological issues, accuracy and validation

A fundamental question regarding any ancestral genome
reconstruction method is its accuracy, and the conﬁdence we
may have in the results it produces. As such methods aim at
inferring an information that has been lost and cannot be recovered,
they cannot be assessed on real data. Validation may be obtained by

0 comparing the results to well-established ones, as in
mammalian data studied by cytogeneticians (Wienberg, 2004),
or yeast data curated by experts (Gordon et al., 2009);

0 comparing to results obtained, in silico, on synthetic data
generated by simulating an evolutionary process;

0 studying and validating the underlying principles of the method
and their implementation;

0 studying the robustness of the choices made by the method to
small parameter changes or data perturbations.

First, we can remark that, when applied to reconstruct the ancestral
boreoeutherian genome, whose structure is widely agreed upon
by bioinformaticians and cytogeneticians, the introduction of the
ASG does not bring additional information here (i.e. all connected
components are single CARs; results not shown). So our method
deﬁnes this ancestor uniquely in terms of CARs, and obtains results
similar to previous reconstructions (Chauve and Tannier, 2008; Ma
et al., 2006).

We think that using simulated data is not relevant presently:
relevant simulations would require to follow a realistic model
of genome structural evolution (here in terms of genome
rearrangements), and such a model is currently not available. Crucial
elements of this model—for example, rearrangement rates, ratio of
different types of events, distribution of breakpoints along genomes,
breakpoints re-use, rearrangement and duplication lengths, fate of
duplicated genes following a WGD—are still not well understood.
Accurate ancestral genomes inferred using model-free methods
(methods that do not rely on a genome rearrangement model) will
be key to improve our understanding of the evolution of vertebrate
genomes and participate to develop better models, that can then be
used to reﬁne inference methods and develop realistic simulated
datasets.

We then propose here to evaluate our results by highlighting
important properties of the method itself, that complement the
extensive robustness analysis described in the previous section.

All ancestral features are supported: if two blocks are found
adjacent or syntenic in the ancestor, it is immediately possible
to recover the signal that deﬁnes this feature (extant or reliable
adjacency, genome segment deﬁning a common interval, synteny,
double synteny). Hence, every such feature can be assessed
individually by looking at the precise genome segments, alignments
and genes that support it. Although this is not a validation of
the method we propose, this provides the appropriate ground for
discussing the results it produces, either in the light of evolutionary
arguments (such as possible convergent evolution, for example) or
from a data processing point of view (alignment quality, orthology
detection, DCS boundaries, to cite a few).

This is not the case, for example, of rearrangement techniques
(Alekseyev and Pevzner, 2009), where an ancestral adjacency can
be inferred while never present in the data, its presence being due
to a parsimony criterion in a simpliﬁed model of evolution. While

112 /3.Io'S[eumo[pJOJXO'SorieurJOJurorqp:duq uroii papeolumoq

91oz ‘Og isnﬁnv uo ::

A.Ouangraoua et al.

 

this does not rule out that parsimony methods can provide accurate
results, the lack of ways to assess ancestral feature is a problem our
method aims at addressing.

Optimization is almost absent: any optimization step based on a
simpliﬁed evolutionary model (Alekseyev and Pevzner, 2009) or on
clustering methods (Muffato et al., 2010) results in arbitrary and
uncontrolled choices, and is subject to the pitfall of the multiplicity
of optimal (and slightly suboptimal) solutions (Eriksen, 2007). Here
we try to reduce the optimization step as much as possible, by being
very stringent on the retrieved signals and thus limiting the conﬂicts.
And indeed we discard only 0.5% of the inferred information to
construct the CARs, which is the only optimization step we use.

Stringent implementations: we chose to implement each phase
in a stringent way, using established comparative genomics
concepts. First, we deﬁned ancestral blocks using reference genome
alignments from Ensembl that were conserved in all amniote
genomes (universal seeds) and then joined seeds into blocks if
collinear again in all amniote genomes. Hence, we followed a
more conservative approach than in most synteny/orthology blocks
models, that allow local rearrangements (Chauve and Tannier, 2008;
Ma et al., 2006; Pham and Pevzner, 2010).

Next, we inferred CARs mostly from sets of blocks that
are contiguous in pairs of informative extant genomes: common
intervals and conserved adjacencies; the information added from
reliable rearrangements had very little impact. It is important to note
here that common intervals are associated with an implicit statistical
signiﬁcance. Indeed, as shown in Xu et al. (2008), one can expect to
ﬁnd in a random gene order two common intervals, both of length
two. Hence, larger common intervals are statistically signiﬁcant.
Together with the fact that most CARs are deﬁned primarily by
common intervals, this shows that the signal deﬁning CARs is
signiﬁcant. Relying on such stringent conserved characters resulted
in a set of ACSs that was almost conﬂict free, which suggests a low
rate of false positives.

Regarding the edges of the ASG, to reduce the impact of possible
false positives, we relied on statistical tests of synteny conservation,
and corrected the whole procedure for multiple testing. Moreover,
to add one additional layer of safety, we discarded from the ASG
all edges that were not supported in extant genomes of at least three
of the four main clades we considered. In conclusion, all ancestral
features are deﬁned in terms of statistically signiﬁcant combinatorial
structures.

4.4 Future research

The computational reconstruction of ancestral genomes is still a
recent research topic, especially when it comes to ancient genomes
with faint traces of synteny conservation. We discuss below possible
ways to improve the different stages of the method we introduced.

Ancestral blocks: our work relies strongly on the set ancestral
blocks, that are the basic bricks of the reconstruction process: both
CARs and edges of the ASG are deﬁned in terms of these blocks.
Hence, their accuracy is central to ensure the accuracy of the inferred
ancestral genome, and false positives (i.e. blocks that do not descend
from a single ancestral genomic segment) can lead to wrong ALGs
or syntenic associations. This calls for new research on orthology
blocks, their desirable properties and methods to detect them or
assess their accuracy. In particular, the traditional approach that

relies on universal, or almost universal, seeds (DNA alignment or
orthologous genes) to deﬁne such blocks needs to be revisited to
cope with the increasing number of sequenced vertebrate genomes,
as illustrated recently in Pham and Pevzner (2010).

Doubly conserved syntenies: the present work illustrates the
interesting potential of DCS to infer syntenic information from
genomes having evolved through aWGD (already noticed by several
previous works), but it also shows that the lesser constraints on
the detected signal requires great care in using such signal to infer
ancestral syntenic features. In particular, it should be remarked that a
DCS in an amniote might not represent an ancestral genome segment
but the union of several ancestral syntenic genome segments.
This is the reason why we chose not to use DCSs as ancestral
contiguous sets but as synteny signals only. In our previous study
(Ouangraoua et al., 2009), using DCSs as ACSs for the amniote
ancestor reconstruction led to a high ratio of discarded ACSs (14%),
most of the discarded ACSs being linked to DCSs. The problem
of detecting high conﬁdence DCS is of importance beyond the
case of amniote genomes, as WGD happened in yeasts genome
evolution (Semon and Wolfe, 2007a), or, at a larger scale, in plant
genome evolution (Salse et al., 2008, 2009a, b).

The ASG: the combinatorial properties of the ASG deserve deeper
investigations. A close look at the graph we obtain for the ancestral
amniote genome shows both highly connected sets of CARs,
indicating clear groups of syntenic CARs, and weakly connected
structures such as bridges, illustrating the faint traces of evolution
supportng some syntenic associations. Among the natural questions
on the ASG, it remains to see if CARs grouped in dense subgraphs
can be ordered. i.e. if they can be arranged in linear structures
representing larger ancestral chromosomal segments. This problem
could be attacked for example by weighting the edges of the ASG
with estimated genomic length representing the distance between
blocks along an ancestral chromosome. From a theoretical point of
view, this becomes related to the graph bandwidth problem.

Amniote genomes evolution: our dataset is unbalanced, with only
two birds. It will be interesting to see the additional information
that can be obtained from the turkey, lizard and xenopus genomes.
Our method can handle genomes in scaffold form, but they were
excluded from our study because they were not present in the
Ensembl multiple alignments we used to compute ancestral blocks.

Our reconstruction of ancestral amniote linkage groups suggests
that this branch is slowly evolving in structure since the amniote-
therians divergence. To reﬁne this hypothesis, as well as to
better understand the structure of amniote breakpoint regions
(Larkin, 2010), we would need to compute genomic distances and
evolutionary scenarios along the different lineage. The availability
of a high-resolution ancestral amniote genome and of efﬁcient
methods for sampling rearrangement scenarios (Miklos and Tannier,
2010), adapted to handle fragmented and partially ordered ancestral
genomes, should allow such studies.

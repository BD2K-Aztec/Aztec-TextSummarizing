Table 1. List of various types of descriptors for complex molecular data
by chi

 

 

Data types Feature groups Number of
descriptors
Proteins Amino acid composition 8420
Autocorrelation 720a
Composition, transition 147
and distribution
Conjoint traid descriptors 343
Quasi-sequence order 160a
Pseudo-amino acid composition 130a
PSSM proﬁle 7
PCM 7
GO similarity 7
Sequence similarity 7
Compounds Constitutional 15
Topological 183
Geometrical 49
Electronic 34
Hybrid 23
Molecular property 4
Fingerprints 10
Maximum common substructure 7
Compound7 Type 1 Nc + Np
protein interaction Type 2 Nc >< Np
Protein7 Type 1 Np + Np
protein interaction Type 2 Np + Np
Type 3 Np >< Np

 

Note: "The number of descriptors depends on the choice of the number of properties
of amino acids and the choice of the parameter in corresponding algorithms. Nc and
Np denote the number of molecular descriptors for compounds and proteins,
respectively.

biocLite[‘chi’, dependencies = C(‘Imports’, ‘Enhances’)]

chi mainly covers the following four functionalities:

(a) For small molecules, chi could (i) calculate >300 mole—
cular descriptors, including constitutional, topological, geo—
metrical, electronic, hybrid and molecular property
descriptors; (ii) calculate 10 types of molecular ﬁngerprints,
including standard and extended Daylight ﬁngerprints,
graph ﬁngerprints based on simple connectivity, hybridiza—
tion fingerprints based only on hybridization state, FP4
keys, E—state fingerprints, MACCS keys, PubChem ﬁnger—
prints, KR ﬁngerprints deﬁned by Klekota and Roth, short
path ﬁngerprints, etc; (iii) realize parallelized pair—wise
similarity computation derived by ﬁngerprints and five
types of similarity measures within a list of small molecules;
(iv) realize parallelized chemical similarity search with
selected similarity metrics and maximum common substruc—
ture search between one query molecule and one molecular
database.

(b) For protein sequences, chi could (i) calculate a large
number of commonly used structural and physicochemical
descriptors, such as amino acid composition, autocorrela—
tion, composition, transition, distribution, conjoint traid,
quasi—sequence order and pseudo amino acid composition
descriptors; (ii) calculate six types of generalized scale—based

descriptors for proteochemometric (PCM) modeling, such
as generalized scale—based descriptors derived by principal
components analysis, amino acid properties, molecular
descriptors, factor analysis, multidimensional scaling, and
generalized BLOSUM/PAM matrix—derived descriptors;
(iii) calculate profile—based protein features based on
position—speciﬁc scoring matrix (PSSM); (iv) realize paralle—
lized similarity computation derived by protein sequence
alignment and Gene Ontology (GO) semantic similarity
measures between a list of protein sequences/GO terms/
Entrez Gene IDs.

(c) For interaction data, by combining various types of
descriptors for drugs and proteins, interaction descriptors
representing protein—protein or compound—protein interac—
tions could be conveniently generated with chi, including
(i) two types of compound7protein interaction descriptors;
(ii) three types of protein7protein interaction descriptors.

((1) Several useful auxiliary utilities are included in chi: (i)
parallelized molecule and protein sequence retrieval from
several online databases, such as PubChem, ChEMBL,
KEGG, DrugBank, UniProt, RCSB PDB, etc; (ii) molecular
reading/writing in SMILES/SDF formats for small mole—
cules and FASTA/PDB formats for proteins; (iii) molecular
format conversion between ~140 types of molecular formats
defined by OpenBabel.

3 DSCUSSON

chi contains a selection of molecular descriptors to analyze,
classify and compare complex molecular network in the context
of network biology/pharmacology. They facilitate to exploit ma—
chine learning techniques to drive hypothesis from complex mo—
lecular datasets. The usefulness of these molecular descriptors
covered by chi for representing structural features of various
molecular data has been sufﬁciently demonstrated by a number
of published studies of the development of machine learning pre—
diction systems.

In the future work, we plan to apply integrated features on
various biological and drug research questions, and extend the
range of functions with new promising descriptors for the
coming versions of chi.

Funding: This study was supported by the National key basic
research program (2015CB910700) and the National Natural
Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 81402853) and the
Postdoctoral Science Foundation of Central South University.
The studies meet with the approval of the university’s review
board.

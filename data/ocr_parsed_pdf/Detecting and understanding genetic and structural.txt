ABSTRACT

Motivation: To define V3 genetic elements and structural features
underlying different HIV-1 co-receptor usage in vivo.

Results: By probabilistically modeling mutations in the viruses isolated
from HIV-1 B subtype patients, we present a unique statistical pro-
cedure that would first identify V3 determinants associated with the
usage of different co-receptors cooperatively or independently, and
then delineate the complicated interactions among mutations func-
tioning cooperatively. We built a model based on dual usage of
CXCR4 and CCR5 co-receptors. The molecular basis of our statistical
predictions is further confirmed by phenotypic and molecular model-
ing analyses. Our results provide new insights on molecular basis of
different HIV-1 co-receptor usage. This is critical to optimize the use of
genotypic tropism testing in clinical practice and to obtain
molecular-implication for design of vaccine and new entry-inhibitors.

1 INTRODUCTION

HIV is the etiological agent of the acquired immunodeﬁciency
syndrome, affecting ~40 million people worldwide (World
Health Organization, http://www.who.int/hiV/en/). HIV is an en-
veloped Virus with a single-stranded RNA genome that mainly
infects CD4+ lymphocytes and macrophages. HIV entry is a
complex and intricate process that facilitates the delivery of
HIV-1 genome into the host cell. The only Viral surface protein,
envelope (Env), is composed of a trimer of gpl20 and gp41
heterodimers. To enter the target cell, HIV requires a coordi-
nated interaction of the envelope glycoprotein gpl20 with the
CD4 receptor and with one of the chemokine receptors, mainly
CC chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) or C-X-C chemokine
receptor type 4 (CXCR4). HIV-1 strains can be phenotypically

classiﬁed according to Virus ability to use the CCR5 and/or
CXCR4 co-receptor. Thus, pure R5-tropic and pure X4—tropic
Virus can use only the CCR5 and CXCR4 co-receptors to enter
the target cell, respectively (Berger et al., 1998), whereas
dual-tropic Virus can use both co-receptors. HIV-l co-receptor
usage is so far of central pathological importance. It has been
shown that R5-tropic Viruses are generally responsible for the
establishment of the initial infection and predominate in the ma-
jority of newly HIV-l-infected patients, whereas the use of the
CXCR4 co-receptor is generally observed in more advanced
stages of disease, and it has been associated with a more rapid
CD4 decline and progression to AIDS (Berger et al., 1998;
Regoes and Bonhoeffer, 2005). The determination of HIV-1
co-receptor usage is also critical, as the CCR5 co-receptor has
recently become the target of a new class of anti-HIV-l drugs
that speciﬁcally inhibit the entry of CCR5-tropic HIV-1 strains
into the target cells by allosteric inhibition of the CCR5
co-receptor (Dorr et al., 2005; Princen and Schols, 2005;
Regoes and Bonhoeffer, 2005). Maraviroc is the first approved
CCR5 antagonist that entered clinical practice in 2007. Its ad-
ministration is so far recommended only in patients with pure
R5-tropic Viruses.

Among the different domains of HIV-1 gpl20, the V3 loop is
so far the focus of intense research efforts because it is the pri-
mary determinant for HIV-1 co-receptor usage (Hoffman and
Doms, 1999; Huang et al., 2005, 2007a). Nevertheless, a compre-
hensive map of V3 genetic markers and structural features under-
lying, individually or in network, the pure or dual usage of CCR5
and CXCR4 co-receptor is still missing. In particular, limited
information is available regarding V3 genetic determinants
underlying dual tropism. This is critical, as different studies
have shown that high proportion of patients harbor dual-mixed
tropic Viruses, with prevalence ranging 12715% in drug-naive
and 2&50% in treatment-experienced patients (Church et al.,
2008; Huang et al., 2007b; Lihana et al., 2009; Moreno et al.,
2009; Shepherd et al., 2008).

In this light, using unique computational methods along with
structural analysis and docking simulations, this study is aimed
at deﬁning the V3 genetic determinants and the structural fea-
tures underlying the ability of HIV-1 to use the CCR5 and
CXCR4 co-receptors.

2 METHODS AND MATERIALS

2.1 The dataset and data processing

We downloaded HIV-l type B V3 sequences with phenotypic
determination of Viral tropism (mainly based on recombinant-
Virus entry assay on U87-CD4+-CCR5+-/CXCR4+-expressing
cells) from http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/ (Kuiken et al., 2010) using
Sequence Search Interface (http://www.hiV.lanl.gov/components/
sequence/HIV/search/search.html) where we speciﬁed the down-
load option ‘co-receptor’ to be ‘only CCR5’, ‘only CXCR4’ or
‘only R5X4’. After downloading the data, we performed a phylo-
genetic analysis. After phylogenetic analysis, only one sequence
per patient was conserved. This resulted in a dataset consisting of
390 V3 sequence: 277 were associated with a CCR5 co-receptor
usage, 41 with CXCR4 co-receptor usage and 72 with dual trop-
ism. All the sequences data are provided in Supplementary
Material. All DNA sequences were aligned using Basic Local
Alignment Search Tool and then translated into amino acid se-
quence based on three-letter codons.

2.2 Bayesian partition on dual usage of co-receptor model

We developed a Bayesian Partition on Dual Usage of
Co-receptor Model (BPDUCM) to define V3 genetic determin-
ants either independently or interactively associated with the
usage CCR5 co-receptor only, CXCR4 co-receptor only or
dual of CCR5/CXCR4 co-receptor.

In analysis based on three datasetsiCCR5 only, CXCR4 only
and dual usageisuppose there are N[ sequences from
CXCR4-using Viruses, Nu sequences from CCR5-using Viruses
and NW sequences from dual-using Viruses. Each sequence is of
p-residues long (for V3 here, p = 35). Let X 2 {X1,. . ., Xp} be the
observations of sequences. X is a column vector that contains N
(N=N[+Nu+Nw) observations at the jth position. Residue
type Xij at position j of the ith sequence can be one of Lj-possible
amino acids. We also define dataset indicator Y 2 {Y1,. . ., YN},
which represents the status of co-receptor usage of each se-
quence, that is, Yi=0 if the ith sequence is from a
CCR5-using Viruses, Y, = 1 if it is from a CXCR4-using Viruses
and Y, = 2 if it is from a dual-using Viruses.

The N[ sequences are assumed to be independent and identi-
cally distributed (IID) observations of the variables X 2 {X1,. . .,
Xp} from population using only CXCR4 co-receptor; the Nu
sequences are IID observations of these variables from popula-
tion using only CCR5 co-receptor; and the NW sequences are IID
observations of these variables from population using dual of
CXCR4/CCR5 co-receptor.

Our goal is to describe the complicated relationship between
the sequence observations (X) and the dataset indicator W).
Basically, we partitioned the p (p = 35) positions into K groups
(K: 10 in Figure la, Gl ~ G10 represent Group 1 to Group 10)
according to their relationship to Y. Each of the K groups rep-
resent one relationship between X and Y. Then we calculate the
posterior probabilities of different partitions (partition p pos-
itions into K groups). We denote I=(Il, 12,..., Ip) as the
group indicator. Ij=k (j=l,..., p and k=l,..., K) means
the jth position is partitioned into the kth group. Given Y, we
observe X and want to infer I when p and K are fixed.
The likelihood is P (X|I, Y), and the posterior probability is

mutation to be cooperatively associated with CCR5 usage (red, G10 in a)

P (I|X, Y), which is proportional to the previous P (I|Y) times
the likelihood P O(|I, Y). We also assume that I is independent of
Y previously, therefore, P (I|Y): P (I). A Markov chain Monte
Carlo algorithm was then designed to sample from the posterior
distribution of I so as to infer which positions are associated with
the co-receptor usage status, with the following proposals: ran-
domly choose one position and change its group membership 1,.

Regarding the possible independently or interactively associ-
ations among three datasets, we proposed a BPDUCM: Gl ~ G5
for variables (positions) in X independently associated with Y
and G6 ~ G10 for variables interactively associated with Y.
Details of BPDUCM model can be found in Supplementary
Material.

2.3 Recursive model selection

After BPDUCM found interacting positions, we applied recursive
model selection (RMS) (proposed in our previous article, Zhang
et al., 2010, and now has been widely applied in a number of HIV
and HBV studies, SVicher et al., 2011a,b,c,d; SVicher et al., 2012;
Zhang et al., 2012) to infer the detail structure of interactions. In
the aforementioned BPDUCM, variables in G6 ~ G10 are fitted
into a ‘fully saturated’ model. However, in practice, it is desirable
to know the detailed conditional independence structure within
each interaction group. RMS is to ﬁrst infer among two classes of
cruder models, that is, the chain-dependence model and the
V-dependence model, and then recursively apply this strategy
until the data does not support more detailed models.

2.4 GRID-based pharmacophore model application

The GRID-based pharmacophore model (GBPM) method has
been described in a recent publication (Ortuso et al., 2006). In the

Genetic and structural features in HIV-1 B

 

GRID (Goodford, 1985) calculations, the lone pairs, the tauto-
meric hydrogen atoms and torsion angles, relative to the sp3
oxygen atoms and the amide atoms, have been allowed to be
settled on the basis of the probe inﬂuence, whereas the coordin-
ates of all the other atoms have been considered rigid (directive
MOVE: 0). Default values have been used for the other
parameters.

2.5 Docking simulations

Starting from the model of the CCR5 N-terminus in complex
with HIV-1 gp120-CD4 described in the study by Huang et a].
(2005), we performed our CCR5 analysis generating all the ana-
lyzed mutants by single-residue replacement.

To test the accuracy and reliability of our docking approach,
we firstly performed CCR5 re-docking calculation on the wild-
type (WT) HIV-1 gp120 CD4 sequence. We used AutoDock
Vina docking software (Trott and Olson, 2010) defining the
CCR5 N-terminus as ligand and the HIV-1 gp120-CD4 complex
as receptor. For our simulations, we adopted the following con-
ditions: (i) 100 allowed conﬁgurations per ligand; (ii) Gasteiger
partial equalization of orbital electronegativities partial charges
(Gasteiger and Marsili, 1980); (iii) an exhaustiveness increased to
128; and (iv) a cubic box of 70196A3, centered on CD2 atom of
V3 I25 residue.

After single-residue replacement, each mutated complex was
then placed in a cubic cell, with size adjusted to maintain a min-
imum distance of 10A to the cell boundary and soaked with a
pre-equilibrated box of water using the System Builder module
of the Desmond package (Bowers et al., 2006; Desmond version
2.2, Schrodinger, Inc., Portland, OR, USA). All overlapping
solvent molecules were removed, and an appropriate number
of counter ions were added to maintain charge neutrality. To
optimize the geometries, all the complexes were energy mini-
mized, using OPLS2005 as force-ﬁeld (Jorgensen et al., 1996;
Kaminski et al., 2001).

After docking procedure validation, starting from the energy
optimized geometry, all the analyzed complexes were submitted
to AutoDock Vina (Trott and Olson, 2010) docking simulations
using the same aforementioned protocol.

For all the CCR5 studied complexes, we selected the best pose
taking into account the Huang et al.’s (2007a) model geometric
criteria. In particular, we monitored the distance between N7, R31
and I397 with the sulfotyrosine (Tys) at the CCR5 positions 10,
14, and with the Tyr at CCR5 position 15, respectively. Moreover,
we analyzed the torsional angles of the CCR5 Tys residues, and
ﬁnally, for each analyzed complex, we chose the conﬁguration
able to better reproduce these geometric parameters.

By contrast, for all the CXCR4 analyzed complexes, we se-
lected the best energy scored pose, as no experimental structural
data were available.

Finally, all the selected complexes best docking poses were
submitted to optimization and thermodynamic evaluation
using MacroModel version 7.2 (MacroModel version 7.2, Schro-
dinger Inc., Portland, OR, USA, 199872001; Mohamadi et al.,
1990) in the following conditions: AMBER* as force field
(McDonald and Still, 1992), 10000 iterations of minimization
and the GB/SA water implicit model (Still et al., 1990) to take
into account the solvation effect. All the obtained conformations

were evaluated in terms of hydrogen bonds (HBs) and VdW
contacts by means of Maestro graphical interface (Maestro Gra-
phics User Interface, version 9.8, Schrodinger, LLC). The com-
ponent interaction analysis was performed starting from the
optimized best pose of all studied complexes in the following
conditions: (i) AMBER* as force field; (ii) GB/SA water implicit
solvation model; (iii) dielectric constant equal to 1; and (iv) a
binding pocket deﬁned considering gp120 residues within 12A
from the co—receptor (Maestro Graphics User Interface, version
9.8, Schrodinger, LLC).

All 3D ﬁgures were performed using PyMOL graphics and
modeling package version 1.3 (The PyMol Molecular Graphics
System, version 1.3, Schrodinger, LLCiDeLano Scientiﬁc, San
Carlos, CA, USA. http://www.pymol.org).

Our molecular modeling calculations were performed on a
Linux cluster with fifteen dual-Xeon processor nodes.

3 RESULTS

3.1 HIV-1 gp120 V3 determinants and their association
with CCR5, CXCR4 or dual usage

With V3 sequences downloaded from Los Alamos Database
(http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/; Kuiken et al., 2010), there is a com-
pendium of 390 DNA sequences for HIV-1 B subtype patients
V3 domain, among which 277 use CCR5 co-receptor only, 41 use
CXCR4 co-receptor only and 72 use dual of CCR5/CXCR4
co-receptor (see Section 2). We proposed and applied
BPDUCM (see Section 2, Fig. 1a) on the aforementioned 390
HIV-1 B subtype gp120 V3 amino acid sequences. Figure 1b
shows the posterior probability from this model for their associ-
ation with usage of different co-receptors. We identiﬁed and
characterized a number of V3 determinants signiﬁcantly asso-
ciated with the usage of those three cases (posterior probabil-
ity>0.8). Among them, V3 genetic determinants 5, 11, 13, 14, 16,
20, 21, 22, 25 and 29 independently associated with CCR5
co-receptor. Notably, the results suggested some cooperative as-
sociations: V3 genetic determinants 12, 28, 32 and 34 interacted
with each other modulating HIV-1 ability to use the CCR5 spe-
ciﬁcally (corresponding to G10 in Fig. 1, localization of these
four V3 residues is reported in Supplementary Figures S1 and
S2). Then we applied RMS (see Section 2) to infer the dependent
structure of interactions. RMS showed that these four positions
could be further divided into two independent subgroups: 12 and
28, and 32 and 34. Tables 1 and 2 show the detail distributions of
WT and mutant types in these two groups. CCR5 clearly has
different distribution compared with CXCR4 and dual. The WT
amino acids at those positions are associated with CCR5 usage,
whereas the majority of mutations at those positions are asso-
ciated with CXCR4-usage.

For position 12 and 28, from Table 1, no mutation at 28 was
observed in CCR5, whereas G28E was observed in both CXCR4
(2.4%) and dual (2.8%). However, in CXCR4, only single mu-
tation G28E was observed, whereas double mutation
Il2F+G28E shows up in dual. This indicates an interesting
epistasis effect between these two mutations that we investigated
in more detail by our computational analysis described in next
section. For positions 32 and 34, single mutations Q32K (Q32R)
and H34Y and the double mutation Q32K + H34Y are observed

in all of the three groups of patients, indicating their ability to
adopt CCR5, CXCR4 and dual.

On the basis of the statistical results, we further performed
molecular modeling and structure analysis to shed light on the
molecular and structural aspects of their epistasis impact on
co-receptorispecific usage. The thermodynamic details are re-
ported in Table 3, and the obtained results are described in the
following. We have also analyzed the interactions, in terms of
HBs and VdW contacts, of both co-receptors in all the studied
complexes (Supplementary Tables S17S36) to evaluate the con-
tribution of single gp120 residues in the complex stabilization.

3.2 Molecular basis of V3 mutations revealed by docking
analysis and free-energy calculations

Starting from the model of the CCR5 N-terminus in complex
with HIV-1 gp120-CD4 described in Huang et a]. (2005), we
performed docking and thermodynamics evaluation analyses to
investigate the impact of V3 determinants on the strength of
CCRigp120 interaction. In our WT model, all the structural
parameters reported in Huang et al. (2007a) were fully repro-
duced by docking simulations (Supplementary Fig. S3).

By contrast, for CXCR4 complexes, we adopted the 2K05
(Veldkamp et al., 2008) PDB (www.rcsb.org) model of the
co-receptor complexed with the chemokine stromal cell-derived

factor 1. In particular, we used Huang’s model as receptor, and
we applied the same protocol adopted for CCR5. Speciﬁcally in
our experiments, we used the gp120 core obtained from a
CCR5-dependent HIV-B subtype isolate YU2. Consistent with
this, in gp120 WT sequence, CCR5 was associated to a more
favorable free energy of complexation if compared with
CXCR4 (—67.2kcal/mol CCR5 versus —40.1 kcal/mol CXCR4).

GBPM application in co—receptors recognition step: With the
aim to select the most involved residues in the co-receptors rec-
ognition step, our GBPM computational approach (Alcaro
et al., 2010a) was applied onto the WT gp120 CCR5 and
CXCR4 optimized best poses. The GBPM method is an example
of unbiased pharmacophore model approaches generation based
on the GRID approach (Goodford, 1985). Pharmacophore
models are useful tools for drug discovery and lead optimization
processes, as they allow collection of most relevant structural
features of biological active molecules. One of the first studies
to demonstrate the impact of computational methods on drug
design, published by von Itzstein et a]. (1993), highlighted the
energetically favorable site for an amino or guanidine group in
the active site of the influenza Virus neuraminidase using the
GRID program. This approach guided the design and modiﬁca-
tion of a transition-state analogue lead compound, ultimately
resulting in the drug Relenza.

In our analysis ﬁrst of all, we used the well-known GRID
software (Goodford, 1985) to highlight the co-receptors crucial
moieties. In particular 0- and SO probe molecular interaction
fields (MIFs), representing the sp2 anionic oxygen and the pyr-
amidal sulfur, respectively, well recognized CCR5 and CXCR4
sulfotyrosines at position 14 and 107, respectively (Supplemen-
tary Figs S4 and S5). At CCRigp120 interface, area residues

Genetic and structural features in HIV-1 B

 

K175, R3, G24, E25, I26, D29, I30, R31, P395, P396, I397 and
R398 were identiﬁed using three different probes: a generic
hydrophobic (DRY), an HB acceptor (O) and an HB donor
(N1). Because the obtained global energy minimum GRID
points (Emin) were ranked in a wide range of values, graphical
analysis of the GRID maps was carried out by considering, for
each probe, an energy threshold (Ecut) equal to 60% of the
gp1207CCR5 complex Emin, as reported in our previous work
(Alcaro et al., 2010b).

The aforementioned GBPM protocol was adopted for WT
gp120 CXCR4 optimized best pose using the same probes and
indicating as mainly involved in the co-receptor recognition the
residues reported in Table 4.

Speciﬁcally, Supplementary Figures S6 and S7 and Table 4
show the gp120 amino acids selected by GBPM using DRY,
N3+ (cationic sp3 nitrogen), O and N1 probes at energy min-
imum. In particular, at CCR5 interface, E25, I30, R31 and P396
were well identified, whereas in CXCR4 recognition residues,
C173, S177, R3 and A394 were resulted crucial. Speciﬁcally,
DRY MIFs highlighted the hydrophobic residues I30 and
A394 in CCR5 and CXCR4 complexes, respectively, whereas
by analyzing the 0 probe MIFs R31, C173 and R3 were found
to be pivotal for CCR5 and CXCR4 interactions. In gp1207
CCR5 optimized best pose E25 side-chain carboxylate and
P396 backbone oxygens resulted well deﬁned by N3+ and N1
probes. At gp12(LCXCR4 interface area, the HB donor probe
was able to identify S177 side-chain hydroxyl, justifying the abil-
ity of these residues to produce HBs.

Such an interesting qualitative analysis prompted us to quan-
titatively estimate the role of the key identiﬁed amino acids in the
co-receptors recognition step. In particular, a component inter-
action analysis was performed to estimate the average value of
the single four residues contributions for CCR5 and CXCR4
interaction energy. All the obtained data are reported in
Tables 5 and 6.

Single mutations at 12 and 28: As shown in Table 3, it is evi-
dent that the major contribution of V3 positions 12 and 28 to
co-receptor usage is mainly because of the WT amino acids.
Indeed, single mutations at these positions were found almost
exclusively in CXCR4-using or dual-tropic Viruses (see Table 1).
This is the case of mutations at V3 position 12. Single mutations
found at V3 position 12 were related to CCR5 unfavorable af-
ﬁnity proﬁle if compared with the WT sequence (—67.2 kcal/mol
WT, —60.7kcal/mol Il2L and —52.0kcal/mol Il2R), whereas
they remarkably increased CXCR4 afﬁnity (—40.1kcal/mol
WT, —134.0kcal/mol Il2L and —75.6kcal/mol Il2R). The
only mutation at position 12 with high prevalence in dual-
tropic Viruses resulted Il2V, even if it was found slightly predom-
inant in CXCR4-using Viruses (7.3% in CXCR4-using strains,
12.4% in dual-tropic strains and 4% in CCR5-using strains).
Thus, consistent with this, Il2V showed an increased CXCR4
N-terminus binding afﬁnity for gp120 with respect to CCR5
(—69.1kcal/mol for CCR5 and —85.8kcal/mol for CXCR4,
respectively).

These energetic proﬁles resulted well correlated with the con-
tacts analysis for both the co—receptors. In particular, in CCR5
mutated complexes, in presence of Il2L and Il2R substitutions,
the co-receptor lost pivotal HB with R31 and P396 with respect
to the WT sequence; moreover, in Il2R complex, the number of

good contacts with the crucial glutamate at position 25 was
observed remarkably reduced if compared with the WT
(Supplementary Tables S3 and S5).

Interestingly, in Il2V optimized conﬁguration, even if CCR5
resulted able to establish an higher number of HB with respect to
the WT, it lost just those with R31 and P396 and showed a
decreased number of contacts with E25, completely abrogating
the interaction with R31 (Supplementary Table S7). By contrast
for CXCR4, in all mutated complexes at position 12, the
co-receptor resulted able to establish additional contacts with
the crucial residues identiﬁed by GBPM analysis if compared
with the WT. Speciﬁcally, in Il2L and Il2V conﬁguration,
CXCR4 was well stabilized by some HB with C173, R9 and
A394, whereas in Il2R complex, we noticed an increased
number of HB with respect to the WT, and in particular, with
the arginine at position 9 (Supplementary Tables S21, S23 and
S25). Our geometric observations were found in perfect agree-
ment with the component interaction analysis either for CCR5 or
for CXCR4, where the role of the selected residues at the
co-receptors interface area was further conﬁrmed.

The indicated residues were highlighted by GBPM approach at energy minimum.
The interaction energy values are expressed in kcal/mol.

At position 28, single-mutation G28E was exclusively found in
CXCR4 (Table 1), which is consistent with the thermodynamic
data, as it decreased CCR5 afﬁnity if compared with the
WT sequence (—67.2 kcal/mol WT and —51.2kcal/mol G28E),
whereas it remarkably increased CXCR4 afﬁnity (—40.1 kcal/mol
WT and —111.0kcal/mol G28E). Such an energetic profile was

consistent with the analysis of the interactions. In fact, in CCR5
mutated conﬁguration, the co-receptor showed an increased
global number of contacts, but it missed the pivotal HB with
P396 and was able to establish only one VdW contact with
E25, thus resulting less stabilized (Supplementary Table S10).
Also the component interaction analysis highlighted the different
contribution of P396, amino acid of the gp120 C4 domain, in WT
and G28E complexes (—37.30kcal/mol WT versus —0.99 kcal/
mol G28E), conﬁrming the geometric result. By contrast, in
CXCR4 component interaction analysis (Table 6), the most im-
portant single contribution resulted from residue C173, which
was able to establish several VdW contacts with the co-receptor
(Supplementary Table S28). Moreover, CXCR4 showed two cru-
cial HB with S177, not present in the WT complex, conﬁrming its
increased afﬁnity versus gp120 with respect to the WT.

3.3 Epistasis effect of 112F and G28E and tradeoff in dual
usage of CCR5 and CXCR4

Concerning the double mutation at 12 and 28, 112F and G28E
show interesting epistatic effect. From Table 1, single-mutation
G28E was observed only in CXCR4 (but not in CCR5 or dual),
whereas double-mutation Il2F+G28E was observed only in
dual. As shown in our thermodynamic analysis, the single-muta-
tion G28E was found to improve CXCR4 afﬁnity, remarkably
decreasing CCR5 afﬁnity versus gp120 (thus, it cannot be
observed in either CCR5 or dual, as dual requires ability to bind
with both CXCR4 and CCR5). Such an observation is fully con-
sistent with the exclusive presence of G28E alone on
CXCR4-using Viruses. However, as reported in Table 3, in
presence of the double-mutation112F + G28E, both co-receptors
energetic profiles resulted favored if compared with the single-
mutation G28E ones (for CCR5, —57.0kcal/mol 112F+ G28E,
—51.2 kcal/mol G28E; for CXCR4, —57.9 kcal/mol I 12F + G28E,
—1 11.0kcal/mol G28E).

Analyzing CCR5 contacts in presence of the double mutation,
the pivotal HB with 130, R31 and P396 resulted abrogated,
whereas only one VdW interaction with E25 was found (Supple-
mentary Table S11). By contrast, the thermodynamic improve-
ment of CXCR4 N-terminus could be rationalized by two
additional HB with R9, residue not involved in the recognition
of the co-receptor in the WT conﬁguration (Supplementary
Table S29).

More specifically, this effect can be observed also in the
co-receptors component interaction analysis. Indeed, the V3 resi-
due 28 is directly involved in the interface area between V3 and
CXCR4 N-terminus (Table 4). As indicated in CXCR4 compo-
nent interaction analysis, the presence of G28E was strongly
associated to the interaction with C173 in gp120 C2 domain,
whereas this effect was abrogated by the co-presence of Il2F
with G28E (Table 6). On the other hand, CCR5 component inter-
action analysis indicated that when 112L is added to G28E, the
average contribution of the four identiﬁed residues was similar to
that of the WT complex, but speciﬁcally, C173 and R9 resulted
energetically unfavorable if compared with the WT (Table 5).

Therefore, the double-mutation Il2F + G28E observed in dual
is a tradeoff between CCR5 and CXCR4 in the sense that its
binding affinity with CCR5 is better than single-mutation G28E
but worse than WT, whereas its binding afﬁnity with CXCR4 is

Genetic and structural features in HIV-1 B

 

better than WT but worse than G28E. Thus, its ability to bind
with both CCR5 and CXCR4 turns out to be better than both
WT and single-mutation G28E. This ability to bind with both
co-receptors is achieved by the epistatic effect between 112F and
G28E.

Single mutations at 32 and 34: A different situation was found
for V3 positions 32 and 34. Although in this case, the contribu-
tion to pure CCR5 co-receptor usage is also driven by the WT
amino acids and all the single mutations (with a prevalence >1 %,
Table 2) found at V3 positions 32 and 34 determined a strong
increase in CXCR4 afﬁnity (—40.1 kcal/mol WT, —68.9 kcal/mol
Q32R, —99.5 kcal/mol Q32K and — 199.0 kcal/mol H34Y) except
Q32H (—45.2kcal/mol); the decreases in CCR5 afﬁnity did
not result as large as in 112R and G28E cases if compared
with WT (—67.2 kcal/mol WT, —63.1kcal/mol Q32R,
—61.1kcal/mol Q32K, —59.3kcal/mol Q32H, —58.0kcal/mol
H34Y, —52.0kcal/mol 112R and —51.2kcal/mol G28E).

The reduced CCR5 N-terminus stabilization in presence of the
single-mutations Q32H, Q32K, Q32R and H34Y was further
validated by our analysis of contacts. In particular, we observed
that the co-receptor lost crucial HB with 130, R31 and P396
residues (Supplementary Tables S12, S13, S14 and S16), with a
remarkable lack of VdW contacts with E25, especially in Q32H
and H34Y mutated complexes. Moreover, the single contribu-
tion of the aforementioned amino acids resulted signiﬁcantly
decreased if compared with the WT sequence, and in particular,
130 and R31 for Q32H (—21.29 kcal/mol 130WT versus
—8.05 kcal/mol 130Q32H; —25.35 kcal/mol R31WT versus
—9.11 kcal/mol R31Q32H), 130, R31 and P396 for Q32K
(—21.29 kcal/mol 130WT versus —5.56 kcal/mol 130Q32K;
—25.35 kcal/mol R31WT versus —1.62 kcal/mol R31Q32K; and
—37.70 kcal/mol P396WT versus —1.52 kcal/mol P396Q32K),
P396 for Q32R (—37.70kcal/mol P396WT versus —3.63 kcal/
mol P396Q32R) and E25 and R31 for H34Y (—32.46kcal/mol
E25WT versus —5.35 kcal/mol E25H34Y and —25.35 kcal/mol
R31WT versus —3.02 kcal/mol R31H34Y).

By contrast, CXCR4 N-terminus recognition of the glycopro-
tein in presence of Q32H, Q32R and H34Y single mutations
indicated more favorable conﬁgurations of the co-receptor if
compared with the WT complex, in particular when the hystidine
at position 34 was replaced by a tyrosine. Specifically, such a
thermodynamic improvement could be because of the additional
HB established by CXCR4 with S177 in presence of Q32H/K/ R
substitutions, as reported in Supplementary Tables S3(%S32.
Indeed in the most favored H34Y mutated complex, the
co-receptor was found to enhance its interaction network,
making one HB with S177 and resulting well stabilized by two
pivotal HB with R9 (Supplementary Table S34).

The component interaction analysis further supported our
geometric considerations, showing an improved average contri-
bution in all mutated complexes if compared with the WT, with
particular evidence in presence of the single-mutation H34Y
(Table 6).

3.4 Different epistasis effects for Q32K+H34Y and
Q32R + H34Y

Although each of the single mutations Q32K and H34Y mildly
decrease CCR5 afﬁnity (—67.2kcal/mol WT, —61.1kcal/mol

Q32K and —58.0 kcal/mol H34Y) and strongly increase
CXCR4 afﬁnity (—40.1kcal/mol WT, —99.5kcal/mol Q32K
and —199.0 kcal/mol H34Y), the double-mutation Q32K +
H34Y was found to increase the afﬁnity in both CCR5 and
CXCR4 (Table 3).

1n CCR5 recognition, such a double mutation was related to
an increased number of good contacts if compared with the WT,
even if the co-receptor lost HB with 130, R31 and P396
(Supplementary Table S17). However, we observed that, in pres-
ence of both Q32K and H34Y substitutions, CCR5 N-terminus
was well stabilized by additional HB with two arginine residues
at position 3 and 398, respectively, emphasizing the crucial role
of the electrostatic term in the co-receptor recognition step.
Moreover, despite the reduced HB network of CCR5 with 130
and R31, their single contribution resulted much more improved
with respect to the WT sequence (Table 5).

Also CXCR4 thermodynamic improvement, obtained in pres-
ence of Q32K + H34Y double mutation, was rationalized by our
geometric observations. Speciﬁcally, with respect to the WT con-
ﬁguration, we revealed an additional HB with S177 and several
VdW interactions with A394. Our component interaction ana-
lysis validated such a finding, highlighting the strong contribu-
tion of both residues in CXCR4 afﬁnity versus the glycoprotein
(—33.90 kcal/mol S177 and —43.12kcal/mol A394).

A different behavior was observed for the Q32R+ H34Y
double mutation (Table 3). Indeed, although the single substitu-
tion Q32R (similar as Q32K and H34Y) was associated to an
unfavorable CCR5 gp120 recognition (—67.2kcal/mol WT,
—63.1 kcal/mol Q32R and —58.0kcal/mol H34Y) and improved
CXCR4 afﬁnity (—40.1 kcal/mol WT, —68.9 kcal/mol Q32R and
— 199.0 kcal/mol H34Y), the addition of H34Y to Q32R caused a
further decrease in CCR5 afﬁnity if compared with the single-
mutation Q32R (—63.1kcal/mol Q32R and —57.8kcal/mol
Q32R+H34Y) and a strong improvement in CXCR4 affinity
for gp120 (—68.9 kcal/mol Q32R and —164.0kcal/mol
Q32R+ H34Y). Thus, the addition of H34Y to Q32R reinforced
the effect on CCR5 and CXCR4 afﬁnity observed in presence of
the single Q32R.

In particular, the analysis of CCR5 N-terminus contacts in the
best optimized conﬁguration in presence of the double mutation
revealed that, even if the number of contacts was increased with
respect to the Q32R single mutation, the co-receptor lost its HB
with 130 and almost abrogated its interactions with E25
(Supplementary Table S18). Such an observation was validated
by our component interaction analysis, where the single contri-
bution of both residues, and in particular of the glutamate, re-
sulted unfavorable with respect to the WT complex.

Conversely, CXCR4 N-terminus enhanced stabilization in
presence of Q32R+H34Y double mutation seemed related to
the single contribution of S177, rather than to the global inter-
actions network (Supplementary Table S36). In fact, by compar-
ing the geometric analyses when Q32R mutation was present
alone and associated with H34Y, we observed that CXCR4
N-terminus established one HB with S177 in both the complexes.
However, the co-receptor best energetic profile in Q32R + H34Y
optimized conﬁguration was related to a stronger contribution
of the serine at position 177 if compared with the Q32R single
substitution (— 12.30 kcal/mol S177Q32R versus —30.38 kcal/mol
S177Q32R + H34Y).

4 DISCUSSION

In this article, we described a systematic approach for a better
deﬁnition of V3 genetic determinants underlying different
co-receptor usage in vivo. This approach enabled us to capture
sophisticate associations of V3 genetic determinants among the
usage of co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 and even dual usage of
them. This information is critical to optimize the use of genotypic
tropism testing in clinical practice and to obtain molecular im-
plication for design of vaccine and new entry inhibitors. In par-
ticular, the current algorithms for tropism prediction classify the
Virus with respect to its co-receptor usage genetic using statistical
learning methods based on speciﬁc V3 sequence feature and, in
particular, on amino acid substitutions observed at speciﬁc V3
positions. The genetic determinants identiﬁed and characterized
in this study can be used to improve predictive performances of
such algorithms.

We proposed an advanced model to detect mutation asso-
ciated with different co-receptor usage and to infer detailed inter-
action structures among these mutations.

We focused on three cases: Viruses using CCR5 co-receptor,
CXCR4 co-receptor only or dual of CCR5/CXCR4 co-receptor.
A BPDUCM seeking 10 possible partitions was applied to deﬁne
V3 genetic determinants either independently or interactively
associated with the usage of those three cases.

Efforts were also being taken to infer dependency structure
among cooperative associations through RMS procedure.
Positions 12, 28, 32 and 34 were further partitioned into two
interaction subgroups 12 and 28 and 32 and 34.

The molecular basis underlying the mechanisms of action of
such determinants has been further unraveled by docking ana-
lysis and free-energy calculations.

Speciﬁcally, our thermodynamic results conﬁrmed the obser-
vation that mutations at positions 11, 12, 25, 28, 32 and 34 were
found almost exclusively in CXCR4-using or dual-tropic Viruses
(Supplementary Table S50). In particular, G28E, 112M and 112T
substitutions were found to be associated with remarkably favor-
able CXCR4 afﬁnity proﬁles. Such a ﬁnding could be related to
a strong electrostatic contribution of R9 for the co-receptor rec-
ognition in presence of the negatively charged glutamate that
acts as a bridge between R9 and CXCR4 N-terminus
(Supplementary Fig. S8). By contrast, in the 112M and 112T
best poses, this weight decreased, as the co-receptor was able
to establish one HB with C173 and good contacts with A394
(Supplementary Fig. S9).

Another interesting result was obtained in CXCR4 gp120 rec-
ognition in presence of the S11R substitution, associated with a
favorable thermodynamic proﬁle of the co-receptor. Speciﬁcally,
in the best optimized configuration, we observed a strong elec-
trostatic repulsion between the positively charged R11 and R9.
Such a ﬁnding was related to a shift of the arginine at position 9
and its consequent involvement in an HB with a glutamic residue
of the CXCR4 N-terminus, interaction not found in the WT
sequence. Moreover in the WT gp120-CD4-CCR5 complex,
serine at position 11 was involved in 3 HB with threonine at
position 23; interestingly, in the WT gp120-CD4-CXCR4 opti-
mized conﬁguration, in addition to these hydrogen bonds,
S11 established other 2 HB with N13. Consequently, we
noticed a remarkable shift of the terminal part of V3 loop in

gp120-CD4-CXCR4 complex, with a conformational fold
responsible for a RMSD (Root Mean Square deviation), calcu-
lated on V3 residues 11-23 with respect to gp120-CD4-CCR5
complex, equal to 8.91  (Fig. 2).

Interestingly, position 34 was found to be related to the best
CXCR4 affinity profile, in particular when mutation H34Y/N
was associated with substitutions at position 32. Analyzing the
component interaction data, such a ﬁnding could be justiﬁed by
the strong contribution of C173 and S177 residues in CXCR4
recognition. In particular, the co-presence of mutations H34N +
Q32K, associated with CXCR4 usage, was involved in the most
significant afﬁnity improvement because of the co-receptor abil-
ity in establishing two HB with C173. Moreover, the comparison
of such a mutated complex with respect to the WT revealed some
interesting structural insights. In fact, in the WT best pose
CXCR4 was found able to establish two HB and several VdW
interactions with Q32, whereas hystidine at position 34 resulted
implicated in an intramolecular HB with N36. This contacts net-
work could probably explain the conformational change
observed in presence of the double-mutation H34N+ Q32K. In
particular in this case, no intramolecular interaction was noticed,
and CXCR4 was found to get closer to the gp120 C2 conserved
domain, not involved in the co-receptor recognition of the WT
complex (Supplementary Fig. S10).

A previous study highlighted the presence of genetic determin-
ants in C2 domain critical for co-receptor usage (even independ-
ently from the use of CD4) (Dumonceaux et al., 2001). Here, we
provide structural basis explaining the involvement of C2
domain in mechanisms underlying the usage of CXCR4
co-receptor.

Some interesting structural details were also revealed in pres-
ence of Q32K/R and H34Y mutations, with a particular remark
when they were associated. Speciﬁcally, in Q32K and H34Y
mutated complexes, CCR5 N-terminus was able to establish an
HB with C173 and K175, respectively, by means of its tyrosine
terminal residue. These interactions were probably responsible
for the co-receptor shift from the gp120 V3 loop, with the

consequent loss of crucial contacts with E25 and R31 and a ﬁnal
unfavorable thermodynamic proﬁle if compared with the WT
sequence. Interestingly, the co-presence of Q32K and H34Y sub-
stitutions, associated with an increased CCR5-binding afﬁnity
with respect to the WT and to the single mutations, was related
to a signiﬁcant co-receptor conformational change because of a
better accommodation of the sulfotyrosine at position 14, able to
establish an additional HB with R3.

Conversely, when the glutamine at position 32 was replaced
by an arginine, we observed a remarkable conformational
change of the CCR5 sulfotyrosine at position 10. In particular,
with respect to the WT complex, where Huang’s geometries
were well reproduced, Tys10 dihedral angle resulted completely
inverted with respect to the WT, causing the lack of crucial HB
with R31 (Supplementary Fig. S11). Moreover, CCR5
N-terminus terminal tyrosine was able to establish an add-
itional HB with K175, with the co-receptor shift from the
gp120 V3 loop and a ﬁnal destabilizing effect in the glycopro-
tein recognition step.

In CXCR4 gp120 mutated complexes, we observed that the
increased co-receptor affinity versus gp 120 could be attributed to
a conformational rearrangement of the sulfotyrosines. In par-
ticular, in presence of the single-mutations Q32K and Q32R,
Tys21 resulted closer to V3 loop, with remarkable co-receptor
stabilization because of its additional HB with S177. Interest-
ingly, the presence of H34Y mutation, single or associated with
the substitutions at position 32, caused a further conformational
accommodation of CXCR4 N-terminus, with a shift of Tys7,
which was well stabilized by several HB with N5, N6, N7 and
T8 residues. Such an additional conformational change allowed
us to assume that the remarkably increased CXCR4 afﬁnity
mainly depends on the mutation at position 34, rather than at
position 32.

In conclusion, new genetic determinants of tropism within the
V3 domain have been detected and confirmed by phenotypic and
molecular modeling analysis. Additionally, our GBPM analysis
led us to recognize the most relevant structural features of gp120
V3 loop associated with both co-receptors and the most pivotal
proteiniprotein occurring interactions into all the analyzed com-
plexes independently from their chemical nature. These observa-
tions could clear the way for the application of a Virtual
screening method able to identify novel scaffolds as potential
entry-inhibitors and for the development of new pharmacophoric
models helpful in the drug discovery, vaccine design and clinical
disease management (Cardozo et al., 2007; Parczewski et al.,
2010; Sander et al., 2007).

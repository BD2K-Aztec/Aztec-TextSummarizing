Abstract

Long non—coding RNAs (lncRNAs) form the largest class of non—protein coding genes in the human
genome. While a small subset of well—characterized lncRNAs has demonstrated their significant
role in diverse biological functions like chromatin modifications, post—transcriptional regulation,
imprinting etc., the functional significance of a vast majority of them still remains an enigma.
Increasing evidence of the implications of lncRNAs in various diseases including cancer and major
developmental processes has further enhanced the need to gain mechanistic insights into the
lncRNA functions. Here, we present a comprehensive review of the various computational
approaches and tools available for the identification and annotation of long non—coding RNAs. We
also discuss a conceptual roadmap to systematically explore the functional properties of the

lncRNAs using computational approaches.

1 Introduction

Non—coding RNAs have been one of the major focuses in the field of
functional genomics since the last decade. Non—coding RNAs have
been largely classified based on their size into small and long non—
coding RNAs. The former class of ncRNAs encompasses well
studied candidates including tRNAs, miRNAs, piRNAs and
snoRNAs (Birney et (11., 2007; Carninci et (11., 2005; Kapranov
et (11., 2007; Okazaki et (11., 2002). The latter class of non—coding
RNAs encompasses a functionally diverse set of transcripts, which
by definition are transcripts greater than 200 nucleotides in length
with no potential to encode for functional proteins of more than 30
amino acids (Li et (11., 2013; Mercer et (11., 2009). A large number of
transcripts of this class were initially discovered through earlier
studies reporting expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in Human and
mouse through the H—invitation (Imanishi et (11., 2004) and

FANTOM (Carninci et (11., 2005) consortia. This repertoire was sig—
nificantly expanded in the recent years, benefitting from the avail—
ability of technologies to annotate transcriptome at single nucleotide
resolutions (Mortazavi et (11., 2008; Nagalakshmi et (11., 2010).
There are over 23 898 transcripts from 13 870 genomic loci as re—
ported by Gencode (Gencode V21) for humans, which encompass
classes of transcripts previously annotated as antisense transcripts,
intronic transcripts, large intergenic non—coding RNAs (lincRNAs),
and processed pseudogenes (Derrien et (11., 2012; Fig. 1). Long
non—coding RNAs are generally thought to be transcribed by RNA
polymerase II, and largely observed to be 5’ capped and 3’
poly—adenylated, though exceptions to this general rule are not un—
common (Dieci et (11., 2007; Kiyosawa et (11., 2005). Recent evidence
suggests that a small subclass of lncRNAs could encode for small
peptides and could also be processed to smaller RNAs (Andrews and

Rothnagel, 2014; Bazzini et (11., 2014; Fejes—Toth, 2009; Kapranov
et (11., 2007; Pauli et (11., 2014). The functional relevance of these ob—
servations has not been explored to great detail. The lncRNA class
also includes transcripts classified by some authors as macroRNAs
and vlincRNAs. MacroRNAs are long, un—spliced RNAs transcribed
from RNA pol II and can readily form secondary structures.
MacroRNAs such as Airn or KCNQ10T1 function mainly in the
maintenance of imprinting in normal tissues (Marques and Ponting,
2009). VlincRNAs or very long intergenic RNAs on the other hand,
represent a subset of human transcriptome spanning the intergenic
genomic space ranging from 50 to 700 kb in size. These transcripts
have been identified in various tumors and show cell specific expres—
sion. They have also been shown to be associated with pluripotency
or the extent of malignancy in some tumours (St at 111., 2013). High—
throughput techniques have enabled the identification of large num—
ber of circular non—coding transcripts commonly known as circRNAs.
CircRNAs are non—canonical alternatively spliced RNA structures in
which 5’ donor and 3’ acceptor sites are back spliced to form a circu—
lar RNA product. Recent studies have discovered large number of
circRNAs, majority of which have not yet been functionally charac—
terized (Cocquerelle et (11., 1993; Jeck et (11., 2013; Salzman et (11.,
2013; Zhang et (11., 2013).Nevertheless, one of the human circRNAs,
CDR1as has been shown to harbor 70 binding sites for miR—7, thus
potentially acting as microRNA sponge (Bussotti et (11., 2013). Of the
lncRNA repertoire known till date, only a small subset of lncRNAs
appear to be evolutionary conserved (Ponting et (11., 2009). anRNA
conservation could potentially be dealt in four dimensions, viz., (i)
primary sequence, (ii) secondary or tertiary structure, (iii) function
and (iv) conservation in terms of their expression and regulation
(Diederichs, 2014). Most of the lncRNAs are not conserved at the
level of their primary sequence, though lncRNAs could harbor small
stretches of ultra—conserved elements which serve as functional motifs.
At the structural level, lncRNAs could have conserved motifs as in the
case of SRA lncRNA, where they act as functional domains (Johnsson
et (11., 2014). Recent analysis from our laboratory show that regions
of lncRNAs participating in bio—molecular interactions have a paucity
of variations in potential functional domains similar to that of protein
coding exons suggesting a strong selective pressure operating at these
loci (Bhartiya et (11., 2014).

The long non—coding RNA repertoire further encompasses tran—
scripts, which have distinct molecular functions. These functional
attributes could be broadly classified as guides, decoys, signals and
scaffolds (Wang and Chang, 2011), depending upon the types of
molecular interactions with other biomolecules in the cell, namely;
DNA, RNA, proteins or small molecules (Braconi et (11., 2011;
Kirsebom et (11., 2006; Okazaki et (11., 2002; Tsai et (11., 2010). These
interactions have been shown to result in a wide spectrum of func—
tional outcomes ranging from chromosomal inactivation as in the
case of XIST in X chromosomal inactivation (Brown et (11., 1992),
epigenetic modifications as in the association with Polycomb repres—
sor proteins (Zhao et (11., 2008), RNA interference as in antisense ac—
tivity (Katayama et (11., 2005) or scaffolding of biomolecules as in
the case of peri—nuclear bodies (Mohammad et (11., 2008). This diver—
sity of functional outcomes is reﬂected in the myriad ways that
lncRNAs have been implicated in disease processes. Long non—
coding RNAs are presently implicated in a number of disease
processes included cancers, developmental disorders, neurological,
metabolic and immunological disorders (Bhartiya et (11., 2012;
Faghihi et (11., 2008; Klattenhoff et (11., 2013; Nakamura et (11.,
2008; Peng et (11., 2010; Qureshi and Mehler, 2012)

It would be noteworthy to mention the distinct functional roles
and molecular dissection of the functional interactions that have been
characterized for a small subset of lncRNAs. The functional roles of a
vast majority of the lncRNAs still remain uncharacterized and elusive.
The majority of lncRNAs annotated in the recent years have come out
of analysis of transcriptome sequencing datasets and the information
on these transcripts have been largely limited to the genomic loci and
expression patterns in the various conditions studied. This gap in the
understanding of the functional roles of lncRNAs has largely been
due to the non—availability of tools to characterize specific bio—
molecular interactions on genome—scale and of resources, which sys—
tematically catalogue these interactions. Recent insights into specific
molecular interactions of lncRNAs have been obtained from the inte—
gration of genome—scale datasets, both from our laboratory (Jalali
et (11., 2013) and from others (Agostini et (11., 2013; Chu et (11., 2012;
Lu et (11., 2013; Murigneux et (11., 2013; Simon, 2013).

Additional evidence on the potential functional attributes of
lncRNAs have also been obtained from methodologies, which rely
on expression patterns and ‘guilt—by—association’ methods based on
correlation of expression patterns with genes or mutations linked to
known phenotypes (Liao et (11., 2011a). Computational methodolo—
gies integrating genome—scale datasets, expression patterns, motifs
and structure annotations provide immense opportunities towards
understanding the functional role of lncRNAs.

In the present review, we provide an overview of the computa—
tional resources, methodologies and tools available for the identifica—
tion and functional annotation of human long non—coding RNAs. We
also provide a conceptual overview of computational approaches
using genome—scale bio—molecular interactions and expression correl—
ation towards understanding the potential function of lncRNAs. We
also summarize the current status in identifying functional variations
in lncRNAs and discuss the major challenges and opportunities.

2 Computational approaches for LNCRNA
annotation and expression analysis

The earliest large—scale genome—wide annotations of long non—
coding RNAs have largely emerged from the annotation of ESTs
and from orthologous approaches to understand the transcriptome
using tiling microarrays. These studies identified a large and previ—
ously unknown repertoire of transcripts, many of which did not

have any obvious potential to encode for functional proteins
(Bertone et (11., 2004; Birney et (11., 2007; Kapranov et (11., 2007).
Further in—depth characterization of the transcriptome using deep
sequencing from the ENCODE consortium has validated the exist—
ence of many of these transcripts (Bernstein et (11., 2012). As
opposed to conventional microarray—based approach, which is com—
monly used to profile known transcripts, deep sequencing
approaches like RNA—Seq facilitates genome—wide expression profil—
ing thereby unraveling many novel rare transcripts including novel
alternatively—spliced isoforms (Cloonan et (11., 2008; Marioni et (11.,
2008; Montgomery et (11., 2010; Mortazavi et (11., 2008; Mutz et (11.,
2013; Nagalakshmi et (11., 2010; Shendure, 2008). It appears that
further depth and focused approaches would uncover an even larger
repertoire of transcripts.

A generalized computational pipeline for annotation of lncRNAs
includes three steps: (i) alignment of reads to the reference genome, (ii)
assembly of transcripts and isoforms and (iii) annotation of the tran—
scripts for coding potential. Additional independent approaches with
or without sequence information or transcript annotation, including
proteogenomics approaches and RNA secondary structure—based
approaches have also been extensively used to annotate long non—cod—
ing RNAs and are described brieﬂy in the following sections.

2.1 Alignment of reads and transcript assembly

In a conventional transcriptome analysis pipeline the high—quality
reads are aligned to the respective reference genomes using a spliced
read aligner like Tophat (Kim et (11., 2013) or STAR (Dobin et (11.,
2013). The aligned reads are further reconstructed into transcripts
using reference guided assemblers like Cufflinks (Trapnell et (11.,
2010) or Scripture (Guttman et (11., 2010) which performs an ab
initio transcriptome assembly, though de novo approaches for tran—
scriptome reconstruction have also been attempted in many organ—
isms. (Grabherr et (11., 2011; Li et (11., 2009; Zerbino and Birney,
2008). Providing a comprehensive review of the plethora of methods
available for spliced alignment and transcript reconstruction exceeds
the scope of this review. In addition, an exhaustive evaluation and
discussion of more than 25 RNA—Seq aligners (Engstrom et (11.,
2013) and transcriptome assemblers (Steijger et (11., 2013) have been
published recently.

2.2 Annotation of lncRNAs
Identification of lncRNAs broadly involves selection of non—protein
coding transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that lack an open read—
ing frame (ORF) of significant length. The ORFs are predicted using
tools like GetORF from the EMBOSS suite (Rice et (11., 2000). There
is no definite ORF length threshold adopted for lncRNAs. More than
95% of the mammalian proteins in public databases such as
SwissProt and International Protein Index have an ORF of greater
than 100 amino acids (Frith et (11., 2006). Some of the landmark
lncRNA studies have used ORF length cutoffs ranging from 30 to 100
amino acids. However, it should also be noted that some of the well—
characterized lncRNAs such as H19, Xist, Mirg, th2 do have pre—
dicted ORFs longer than 100 amino acids (Dinger et (11., 2008).
Recent studies have drawn attention to the biological significance
of the translated short peptides from short sORFs (Andrews and
Rothnagel, 2014) and their potential regulatory role as biologically
active peptides. A lot of distinguishing factors based on ORF conser—
vation, nucleotide composition, residue bias and codon usage have
been examined towards this goal. Cross—species comparison—based
programs like PhyloCSF (Lin et (11., 2011) and CRITICA (Badger and
Olsen, 1999) have been popular while complementary approaches

like CSTMiner (Mignone et (11., 2003) and RNAcode (Washietl et (11.,
2011) use nucleotide substitution and gap patterns as the criteria to
assess the coding potential of a sequence. Apart from these, other
popular approaches include Support Vector Machine—based classifiers
such Coding Potential Calculator (Kong at 111., 2007), PORTRAIT
(Prediction of Transcriptomic ncRNA by ab initio methods; Arrial
et (11., 2009) which uses multiple distinct sequence features and
Coding Potential Assessment Tool (Wang et (11., 2013) which uses an
alignment—free logistic regression model. Alternately, sequence simi—
larity search programs like BLASTX (Gish and States, 1993) and
HMMER3 (Eddy, 2011) help to identify homologous domains in
protein data repositories which can also be used to identify and re—
move transcripts with protein—coding potential. Apart from these
computational approaches, experimental techniques like ribosomal
profiling have also been employed (Bazzini et (11., 2014) to assess the
protein coding capacity of lncRNAs relying on the periodicity of ribo—
some occupancy along the short translated ORFs.

2.3 Proteogenomics—based approaches to evaluate
coding potential of transcripts

With the rapidly growing number of newly discovered lncRNAs,
several groups have reported that many putative lncRNAs encode
for short peptides (Andrews and Rothnagel, 2014). Recent efforts
have used innovative approaches to scan transcripts for the presence
of putative peptide products using tandem mass spectrometry stud—
ies. For example, the recent ENCODE study analysed RNA—Seq
data along with the proteomics data and suggested that majority of
the annotated lncRNAs (~92%) are not translated (Banfai et (11.,
2012). Introduction of novel strategies like ribosome profiling (the
deep sequencing of ribosome—protected RNA fragments) facilitates
genome—wide quantitative monitoring of protein synthesis at high
resolution. Ingolia and co—workers developed a machine—learning al—
gorithm to systematically deduce protein products from the ribo—
profiling data and identified many putative lincRNAs containing re—
gions of high translation, which they called short poly—cistronic ribo—
some—associated coding RNAs (sprcRNAs; Ingolia et (11., 2011).
However, examples like H19 mouse lncRNA transcript, which func—
tions as a true lncRNA (Brannan et (11., 1990) in spite of harboring
highly conserved ORFs with high ribosomal occupancy (Ingolia
et (11., 2011), demonstrate that ribosomal occupancy alone does not
sufficiently indicate the protein coding potential of a transcript.
Recently Guttman et al. (2013) defined a metric called ribosome
release score (RRS), which records the release of the ribosome on en—
counter with the stop codon to correctly distinguish between coding
and non—coding RNA.

2.4 RNA structure—based approaches for lncRNA
discovery

Several tools have been developed to aid the classification of tran—
scripts as lncRNAs based on the presence of conserved predicted
RNA secondary structures. These include RNAFold (Hofacker,
2003), QRNA (Rivas and Eddy, 2001), EvoFold (Pedersen et (11.,
2006) and RNAz (Gruber et (11., 2010). These approaches have been
used extensively in the literature (Humann et (11., 2013;
Mercer et (11., 2010; Ponjavic et (11., 2009; Washietl et (11., 2005;
Woolfe et (11., 2005 ) and have been discussed for their advantages
and drawbacks (Gorodkin and Hofacker, 2011). Nevertheless, the
use of RNA secondary structure and conservation alone for the iden—
tification of lncRNAs could potentially be misleading as conserved
RNA secondary structures could also be shared between coding and
non—coding transcripts (Dinger et (11., 2008). Given these limitations,

recently there is an increased focus on analyzing RNA structure and
binding properties for functional annotation of lncRNAs over their
detection (Glazko et al., 2012).

3 Databases and resources for long non-coding
RNAs

Concomitant with the increasing number of lncRNAs discovered, a
number of resources collecting, curating and providing associated
functional information of the lncRNAs have been built up in the
recent years. In the present collection, described in detail below, we
have attempted to provide the salient features of lncRNA resources.
A comprehensive listing and description of the resources is summar—
ized in Table 1.

anRNAdb has been one of the earliest manually curated data—
bases of eukaryotic lncRNAs with information derived from litera—
ture and other resources (Dinger et al., 2009; Lein et al., 2007;
Sanborn et al., 2011; Su et al., 2004). Apart from lncRNAdb,

GENCODE is by and large, one of the most popular lncRNA cata—
log. The latest version of Gencode (v21) comprises of 15 877 long
non—coding RNA genes corresponding to 26 414 transcripts.
Another resource, LNCipedia hosts over 21488 annotated human
lncRNA transcripts. The resource provides prediction of secondary
structure as well as assessment of the protein coding potential and in
addition, incorporates an automated reprocessing pipeline based on
data from proteomics experiments to detect ORFs in lncRNAs.
NONCODE 4.0 provides information on transcript isoforms and
their expression in human tissues while a similar resource
lncRNAMap extensively uses RNA—seq datasets available in the
public domain to provide insights into the expression levels of
lncRNAs in different tissues, cell lines and disease conditions
(Chan et al., 2014). The database also incorporates miRNA targets,
homologous protein coding genes and endogenous siRNAs
(esiRNAs) derived from lncRNAs and their targets.

Two resources lncRNome and the Functional lncRNA database
integrate information from other databases to provide insights into

elucidate the functional characteristics of lncRNAs

the functionality of lncRNAs. lncRNome hosts information of over
18 000 human long non—coding RNA transcripts and is maintained
by our group. lncRNome apart from providing information on gen—
omic motifs including sequence and structural motifs also provides
information on RNA processing, miRNA binding sites from PAR—
CLIP datasets and epigenetic modifications in close proximity with
lncRNA promoters (Bhartiya et al., 2013). The database also maps
genomic variations in lncRNA sites and features a genome browser.
The Functional lncRNA Database hosts a subset of well—curated
non—protein coding long non—coding RNAs from literature for
Human, Mouse and Rat (Niazi and Valadkhan, 2012), and includes
over 180 human lncRNA annotations. Each lncRNA annotation
also is accompanied by miRNA precursor information, repeat infor—
mation and predicted ORFs, apart from the genomic information
and sequence.

Apart from the primary lncRNA databases which provide infor—
mation on lncRNAs, a number of databases also feature functional
information of interactions of lncRNAs in specific contexts. Many
of these databases also rely on expression information, integration
of genome—wide datasets and computational predictions to be able
to provide clues into the functional insights of lncRNAs. A subset of
the prominent databases is detailed below.

Starbase v2.0 (lncRNABase) integrates public RNA—protein
interaction sites generated from high—throughput datasets. The dis—
tinct feature of this database is that it provides a comprehensive
overview of miRNA—lncRNA interaction maps apart from the
expression information. NRED provides microarray and in situ
hybridization gene expression information for thousands of tran—
scripts including long ncRNAs in human and mouse (Dinger et al.,
2009). Additionally, information for featured ncRNAs evolutionary
conservation, secondary structure evidence, genomic context links
and antisense relationships are also available.

DIANA—anBase is a comprehensive resource for computation—
ally predicted and experimentally annotated miRNA—lncRNA inter—
actions (Paraskevopoulou et al., 2013). For the experimental
annotation, the database extensively makes use of the CLIP—seq
datasets for Argonaute proteins, apart from genome—wide

degradome sequencing and other datasets. In addition, the database
also provides information on expression, microRNA regulatory
modules and their conservation. A similar database lnCeDB catalogs
human long non—coding RNAs which can potentially act as compet—
ing endogenous RNAs (ceRNA; Das et al., 2014). The database
scores the likelihood of lncRNA—mRNA pair for actually being
ceRNA based on two methods and integrates predicted mRNA—
miRNA interactions from a number of resources. In addition, the
Linc2GO database provides functional annotation based on the hy—
pothesis that lncRNAs can function as a ceRNA.

Apart from the databases which largely discuss the expression
and function of lncRNAs, anRNA Disease maintained by the Cui
Lab systematically collects diseases associated with lncRNAs, and
has created a niche for itself (Chen et al., 2013). The disease associ—
ations of lncRNAs have been curated from literature evidence
from peer reviewed publications, and in addition, were investi—
gated using bioinformatics methods based on genomic
neighborhood.

4 Computational approaches to understand
LNCRNA function and disease associations

A large number of lncRNAs have been discovered through computa—
tional mapping of the transcriptome, but the functional annotation
and intricate molecular mechanisms of gene regulation still remains
an enigma. Computational methods offer a new opportunity to
understand the potential functional implications of lncRNAs.
However, it should be emphasized that follow—up experimental val—
idation would be necessary to examine specific functional correlates
unambiguously. The following section provides an overview of the
popular computational approaches towards deciphering the func—
tionalities of lncRNAs (Fig. 2). Unlike conservation of the sequence
and/or structure, characteristic of members of the small RNA class,
like miRNAs and snoRNAs, lncRNAs are largely not conserved.
Earlier analyses comparing lncRNAs in humans and other model
systems have shown that only a very small subset of the human
lncRNAs are evolutionarily conserved, thus severely limiting synteny
or orthology—based approaches towards extrapolating functions of
lncRNAs from model systems. Unlike protein—coding genes which
require strong sequence conservation to preserve their function,
lncRNAs may only require short stretches of conserved sequence to
maintain structural motifs important for its functional role (Mercer
et (11., 2009).

4.1 Understanding lncRNA function through

expression correlation

The most popular and largely studied approach towards under—
standing the function of lncRNAs have been based on ‘guilt—by—
association’ from co—expression patterns shared with their protein
coding counterparts (Liao et al., 2011a; Necsulea et al., 2014). The
basis of the methodology stems from the concept that transcripts
sharing common expression patterns should largely share similar
biological pathways. A number of different studies have used this
approach towards functionally annotating potential lncRNAs. One
of the first studies on co—expression analysis of lncRNAs and coding
genes at the genome scale (Guttman et al., 2009). The authors
ranked the protein coding genes co—expressed with a given lncRNA.
The protein coding genes were further analyzed using Gene Set
Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to identify enriched functional terms
corresponding to the lncRNAs (Subramanian et al., 2005; Mootha
et al., 2003). In another study, a co—expression network between

coding and non—coding transcripts was constructed (Liao et al.,
2011a).This network takes into account not only the co—expression
of lncRNA and protein coding genes but also other lncRNAs, thus
being able to identify statistically significant clusters of co—expressed
genes, which potentially correspond to functional modules. A couple
of computational tools have come up in the recent past, which uses
the probe annotation information of Affymetrix microarrays for the
analysis of expression of lncRNAs. ncFANs (Liao et al., 2011b) and
Noncoder (Gellert et al., 2013) provides a web interface to re—ana—
lyze datasets for lncRNA expression. ncFANs also provides func—
tional annotation based on co—expression patterns of the lncRNAs
with protein coding genes.

4.2 Understanding lncRNA function as part of
interactions
Apart from expression—based approaches, the advent of next—gener—
ation sequencing for understanding bio—molecular interactions
through a variety of methodologies have opened up new avenues to
create genome—wide interaction maps for specific biomolecules.
Though many of these methods have largely addressed the problem in
the perspective of protein coding genes and their regulation, aspect of
lncRNAs still needs to be unraveled. The genome—wide data can be
integrated with the lncRNA annotations enabling construction of
maps of putative biological interactions and thereby correlating po—
tential functional consequences. The biological function of lncRNAs
in the cell could be understood as a function of biological interactions
mediated by lncRNAs with other RNA species (RNA—RNA inter—
actions), with proteins (RNA—protein interactions), with DNA
(RNA—DNA interactions) and/or processing of lncRNAs to smaller
RNAs. In many cases, a combination of one or more of the above—
said interactions could be necessary for the functional outcome.

RNA—protein interactions are crucial for the functioning of
RNA, either independently or in conjunction with other molecules.
One of the well—studied examples is the interaction of lncRNAs
with the Polycomb Repressor proteins to modulate epigenetic
modification of the targets. A number of computational and ex—
perimental approaches have been extensively used to characterize
RNA—protein interactions. The earlier computational tools relied
on sequence, structure and physicochemical properties or features
to predict potential RNA—protein interaction pairs, and the popu—
lar algorithms include CatRAPID (Agostini et al., 2013) and
RPIseq (Muppirala et al., 2011). A specific approach for lncRNA
named lncPro (Lu et al., 2013) has also been developed based on
the physicochemical properties of the interaction pairs. Using this
resource, the authors could predict the interactions of HOTAIR
with PRC2 complex and LSD1 on the basis of their interaction
scores, which were in concordance with the experimental findings
(Tsai et al., 2010). Experimental methods for understanding
RNA—protein interactions have also been extensively used. The
most popular approach includes cross—linking immunoprecipita—
tion followed by sequencing (CLIP—seq; Murigneux et al., 2013)
and its variants. Other complementary experimental methodolo—
gies include protein capture on RNA like RNA affinity in tandem
(RAT; Hogg and Collins, 2007), Csy4 Select (Lee et al., 2013) and
MS2—TRAP (Yoon et al., 2012). Affinity—based capture approaches
including SeqRS (Campbell et al., 2012) and RNAcompete (Ray
et al., 2009) have also been used to identify RNA binding proteins
interacting with specific RNAs.

Apart from interaction with protein, one of the active areas of
interest has been to identify genomic targets of lncRNAs. A number
of well—studied lncRNA candidates like Xist, HOTAIR and

HOTTIP modulate their function through interactions with genomic
DNA (Mercer et al., 2013). A number of experimental approaches
to identify RNA—DNA interaction sites have been used in the recent
years. Chu et al., introduced a technique of Chromatin Isolation by
RNA purification (CHIRP; Chu et al., 2012). The approach used til—
ing oligonucleotides to capture specific RNAs with bound protein
and DNA sequences, the sequence identity of which could be de—
ciphered by sequencing. Simon et al., developed this hybridization—
based technique by designing affinity—tagged versions of the comple—
mentary oligonucleotides against the RNA called Capture
Hybridization Analysis of RNA Targets (CHART; Simon, 2013).
This technique could identify interaction of lncRNAs at the chroma—
tin level. It has also been hypothesized that lncRNAs could function
through formation of DNA—RNA triplexes where lncRNAs form the
third strand. For example, a long non—coding transcript originating
from upstream region of the major DHFR promoter represses the
transcription of downstream protein coding gene by forming an
RNA—DNA triplex structure with the DHFR promoter (Blume
et al., 2003; Martianov et al., 2007). Computational approaches
like Triplexator (Buske et al., 2012) and R—loop finder
(Wongsurawat et al., 2012) offers enormous promises to computa—
tionally predict such interactions on a genome—scale.

Besides interactions with DNA and proteins, lncRNAs have also
been extensively shown to interact with other RNAs. The most
widely studied interactions have been miRNA—lncRNA interactions,
where it has been widely proposed that lncRNAs could modulate
the action of regulatory microRNAs by acting as a sponge (Ebert
et al., 2010; Salmena et al., 2011). Our group (Jalali et al., 2013)
has recently re—constructed a genome—wide interactome of lncRNA
and miRNAs which might play regulatory roles in gene expression.
Argonaute proteins are part of the RISC complex which mediates
targeting of microRNAs. PAR—CLIP datasets of argonaute proteins
serve as the evidence pointing to microRNA binding. A number of
computational tools have also been extensively used to identify con—
served and non—conserved microRNA targets in transcripts. It is also
noteworthy that some of the lncRNAs serve as templates for the bio—
genesis of small regulatory RNA. Using small RNA sequencing data—
sets and comparison of the genomic loci, a genome—wide map of
lncRNA processing has also been discussed (Jalali et al., 2012). In
addition to this, (Johnson and Guigo, 2014) have proposed a repeat
insertion domains of lncRNAs (RIDL) hypothesis where they ad—
dress that the transposable elements may serve as functional do—
mains for lncRNA interactions with proteins or nucleic acids.
anRNAs harbor a higher frequency for transposable elements
(TEs) than protein coding exons. Some lncRNAs like AK046052, a
brain specific mouse lncRNA is thought to be derived from TEs. The
insertion of TEs in an lncRNA sequence is thought to add function—
ality by virtue of serving as interacting domains for proteins, RNA
and DNA. The outcome could be exemplified in interactions such as
Alu/LINE mediated interaction with ribosomal complexes or Alu—
mediated mRNA decay by lncRNA (Johnson and Guigo, 2014).

4.3 Understanding lncRNA structure and motifs

A variety of computational approaches including single sequence
structure predictors like Mfold (Zuker, 2003), RNAfold (Hofacker,
2003) and Sfold (Ding et al., 2004), sequence alignment—based tools
like QRNA (Rivas and Eddy, 2001), EvoFold (Pedersen et al., 2006)
and RNAz (Gruber et al., 2010) multiple structural alignment tools
like RNAForester (Hochsmann et al., 2004) and MARNA (Siebert
and Backofen, 2005 ) and derivatives of Sankoff’s algorithm like
Foldalign (Havgaard et al., 2005), Dynalign (Mathews and Turner,

112 /310'S[BIIJHO[pJOJXO'SOIJ’BLUJOJIIIOICI”Idllq 11101} pep1201umoq

Computational approaches for lncRNA analysis

2002) and LocARNA (Will et al., 2007) have been employed for
RNA structure predictions of short conserved domains within
lncRNAs, though it is still uncertain if all lncRNAs harbor local struc—
tured domains. It is also important to note that most of these RNA
structure prediction approaches have high false positive rates, around
50%. Minimum free energy folding—based approaches often fail to
provide reliable signals that can clearly distinguish non—coding RNA
structures from random sequences. While approaches driven by se—
quence—based alignments are faster than structure—based alignments,
the former fails to capture the hidden dimension of conservation at
the structure level often missed in weakly conserved primary se—
quences. Additional algorithmic advances including the use of conser—
vation and additional features to predict pseudoknots have been
developed in the recent years (Gruber et al., 2010; Ren et al., 2005;
Ruan et al., 2004; Sato et al., 2011). The predictions of structure of
lncRNAs were largely limited by the non—availability of accurate
methods to predict structures of these long RNAs which are mostly
unstructured. Therefore, it is important to integrate computation pre—
dictions with other types of data including experimental approaches
to ensure precise functional annotation. A detailed discussion on the
pros and cons of these approaches has been detailed previously
(Gorodkin and Hofacker, 2011). Recent experimental approaches
using next generation sequencing technology such as PARS (Kertesz
et al., 2010), FragSeq (Underwood et al., 2010), and SHAPE—seq
(Lucks et al., 2011) have significantly added to the repertoire of the
structural map of lncRNAs. Sequence and structure motifs in RNAs
have been an active area of interest. A number of computational tools
including RegRNA (Chang et al., 2013) have curated structural and
sequence motifs in RNA and offer a user—friendly interface to identify
them in sequences. In addition, non—conventional motifs including G—
quadruplex motifs and intramolecular RNA triplexes have been ac—
tively studied (Carmona and Molina, 2002; Hacht et al., 2014;
Nguyen et al., 2014). In an earlier bioinformatics analysis of G—quad—
ruplex motifs in the lncRNome distinct patterns of occurrence have
been demonstrated in lncRNAs compared to protein coding genes
(Bhartiya et al., 2013). A number of computational tools to predict
G—quadruplexes have been reported and offer a unique opportunity to
understand their functional attributes (Frees et al., 2014; Kikin et al.,
2006; Stegle et al., 2009).

4.2 Computational approaches to understand functional
variations in lncRNAs

It is generally observed that a large proportion of the lncRNAs do
not show evolutionary conservation unlike well conserved subsets of
ncRNAs like microRNAs and snoRNAs. Previous studies have also
characterized large variability in the sequence of lncRNAs, which
was used to support the argument that lncRNAs do not probably
have functional roles. Nevertheless it has also been shown that the
well—studied functional lncRNAs such as XIST, HOTAIR show
poor conservation across species suggesting conservation is not a
prerequisite for functionality (Chodroff et al., 2010; Qu and
Adelson, 2012). In a recent analysis, our group (Bhartiya et al.,
2014) has shown distinct patterns of variations in lncRNAs and
compared the variation densities across potentially functional elem—
ents in lncRNAs and protein coding exons. The analysis suggested
that the variation densities in functional elements in lncRNAs were
comparable to the protein coding exons in mRNAs. The authors
also found a number of GWAS associated markers mapped to
lncRNA loci. In one example, three isoforms transcribed from gene
ENSG00000223 891 having binding sites for HUR protein harbor a
SNP (rs6017291) which is associated with cognitive test

performance. This observation opens up enormous opportunities to
map functional elements in lncRNAs and potentially understand the
effects of genomic variations in these elements. Additionally the im—
pact of variations on conserved sequence and structural motifs in
lncRNAs have not been explored to great detail. Computational
tools to map the effect of variations on RNA structure including
popular tools like SNPfold (Halvorsen et al., 2010), RNAsnp
(Sabarinathan et al., 2013) have been proposed. A starting point in
this area has been the analysis which revealed 1900 SNVs which
have a potential to alter the RNA structure (Wan et al., 2014).

4.5 Computational framework towards understanding
the role of lncRNA in Diseases.

Recent genome—wide association studies (GWAS) have provided
immense insights into the potential disease associations of long non—
coding RNAs (Bochenek et al., 2013; Jin et al., 2011; Kumar et al.,
2013; Wu et al., 2013). A recent analysis of GWAS signals in long
non—coding RNAs revealed that a significant proportion of the vari—
ations associated with human traits/diseases map to lncRNA loci
(Hrdlickova et al., 2014; Kumar et al., 2013). A comprehensive com—
pendium of long non—coding RNAs and traits associated with them
have been compiled into a web—based resource lncRNADisease (Chen
et al., 2013). Apart from GWAS, a number of expression—based
approaches to infer disease associations of lncRNAs have been re—
ported in the recent years. In one of the most recent approaches, Gao
and coworkers have used a lncRNA—protein coding gene network
based on lncRNAs and protein coding genes implicated in diseases
and suggested high predictability of the approach towards finding as—
sociations of lncRNAs with diseases (Yang et al., 2014). A similar net—
work—based approach by Liu et al used networks built based on
expression correlation (Liu et al., 2014) and Sun et al., which used
known lncRNA disease associations implemented in the framework
called RWRlncD (Sun et al., 2014), both with reliable accuracies.

5 Knowledge gaps, challenges and opportunities

The current understanding of the role of long non—coding RNAs in
biological processes is largely limited to a handful of well character—
ized candidates, while the lion’s share of the annotated lncRNAs we
know today, do not have any obvious functional annotations. The
lack of functional annotations have been mostly contributed by a
host of factors including the absence of unified resources to annotate
lncRNAs, lack of common biogenesis or mechanism of action for
lncRNAs and primarily, lack of evolutionary conservation of
lncRNAs, which precludes their study in model systems. The present
functional correlations of lncRNAs are largely thus limited to ‘guilt
by association’ studies mainly based on integration of omics datasets
to arrive at potential functional correlates of lncRNAs. The chal—
lenges aside, the larger role of lncRNAs in mediating disease proc—
esses are increasingly being cemented through converging evidence
from GWAS studies as well as expression—based studies in disease
processes. Computational approaches towards understanding the
biogenesis, regulation and function of lncRNAs thus could provide a
huge impetus in the field. The incident opportunity provided by the
ready availability of omics datasets, thanks to large—scale data on
genomics, epigenomics and transcriptomics presently available
through consortia including the ENCODE and NIH RoadMap
Epigenomics projects (Bernstein et al., 2010) provides the much
required baseline to start understanding the regulatory dynamics of
lncRNAs and be able to provide insights into the regulation of
lncRNAs. The second opportunity has been the availability of

sequencing—based approaches to understand biomolecular inter—
actions—be it ProteianNA, RNAzRNA or RNAzDNA interactions,
also described previously in this manuscript. Though the current
availability of the datasets for interactions is limited, integration of
information from disparate datasets has not been attempted towards
understanding unified principles of action of lncRNAs. The third
opportunity has been the recent availability of sequencing—based
approaches to characterize the secondary structure of RNAs, using
chemical or enzymatic approaches followed by sequencing. Insights
into the RNA structure or rather the dynamics of RNA structure
and its relation with bio—molecular interactions would significantly
add to the understanding of lncRNA functionality. The sequence
variations in lncRNAs, be it at the genome level or at the RNA level,
modulated through RNA editing and its effect on structure and
interactions have not been studied to any great extent and is a poten—
tial opportunity. The fifth and the most challenging opportunity
could be potential new approaches to understand sequence, struc—
ture and/or functional orthologs of lncRNAs in models systems to
be able to draw parallels between the phenotypes in animal systems
modulated through lncRNAs with human diseases or traits. This
could potentially be the Holy Grail in the understanding of lncRNA
function.

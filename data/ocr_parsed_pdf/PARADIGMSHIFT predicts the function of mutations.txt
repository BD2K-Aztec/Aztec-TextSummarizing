ABSTRACT

Motivation: A current challenge in understanding cancer processes
is to pinpoint which mutations influence the onset and progression of
disease. Toward this goal, we describe a method called PARADIGM-
SHIFT that can predict whether a mutational event is neutral, gain-
or loss-of-function in a tumor sample. The method uses a belief-
propagation algorithm to infer gene activity from gene expression and
copy number data in the context of a set of pathway interactions.
Results: The method was found to be both sensitive and specific
on a set of positive and negative controls for multiple cancers for
which pathway information was available. Application to the Cancer
Genome Atlas glioblastoma, ovarian and lung squamous cancer
datasets revealed several novel mutations with predicted high impact
including several genes mutated at low frequency suggesting the
approach will be complementary to current approaches that rely on
the prevalence of events to reach statistical significance.

1 INTRODUCTION

A comprehensive cancer survey such as that being generated by
the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program uncovers numerous
genomic events in tumors that are a mix of both causal, driving
events and neutral, passenger events that accumulate as a result
of dysregulated genomic surveillance and cell proliferation with
clonal expansion over time. Exome and whole-genome sequencing
efforts uncover recurrent mutational events in a few genes and low
frequency events in many other genes. Importantly, examples of
such low frequency genes are known to be functionally important
to disease. For example, although BRAFV600E is common in
melanoma, it occurs in only 3% of non-small cell lung cancer, but
is clearly a driver when present (Dankort et (11., 2007).

Although there exist well-described mutations in certain codons of
key genes that drive oncogenesis, most somatic mutations in cancer
are neutral with respect to overall cell ﬁtness. Many approaches exist

to predict the impact of a mutation. However, no existing method
incorporates pathway-level information into the assessment of the
consequences of a mutation. Investigating the impact of a mutated
gene on its pathway neighborhood may provide complementary
information to existing approaches.

Current methods often use the frequency of a mutated gene
across a cohort, the location of a mutation in the gene, whether the
mutations are silent or non-silent, frame-shifting, potentially protein
domain altering, found in more evolutionarily conserved regions of
the peptide sequence, or cluster together in the protein sequence or
structure. Although such methods have shown tremendous success,
they have limitations that impact their generality. For example,
some methods must be trained from external datasets such as from
the COSMIC database, which introduces possible circularity to the
analysis and biases the discovery of genes whose mutational impact
has already been characterized.

The most popular approach builds gene signatures by training
machine-learning classiﬁers to recognize the presence and absence
of mutations from molecular features such as gene expression
data (Mooney et (11., 2011). These methods can be applied to
any number of genomic perturbations including mutations, focal
copy number gains or losses, or chromatin methylation events and
have the potential of detecting whether mutations in regulatory
regions have functional signiﬁcance. Genes with expression levels
that are differentially associated with the presence (compared with
the absence) of a mutation are candidates for inclusion in the
gene signature using any number of a variety of univariate and
multivariate machine-learning and feature selection approaches.
One major limitation is that signatures often fail to generalize from
one dataset to another.

If our pathway knowledge surrounding a particular gene is
complete enough and we have enough data to provide information
about the activity of neighboring genes, then we can estimate the
pathway consequences of a mutation in a tumor sample (Fig. l).
Intuitively, if a mutation inﬂuences the ﬁinction of a focus gene
(FG) it may create a particular signature on FG’s local pathway
neighborhood. In the case of a loss-of—function (LOF) event, the
regulatory inputs to the FG would indicate that the gene should be
turned on at the transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional levels.
For instance, a transcription factor and kinase that regulate different
parts of FG’s activity may themselves be active. However, when

one inspects the activity of genes downstream of FG, one might
ﬁnd evidence that the FG is not active. For example, FG also
may be a transcription factor with target genes exhibiting low or
undetectable levels of expression. In the gain-of—function (GOF)
case, the opposite situation would occur where the downstream
targets are consistent with a higher activity of the FG than what
would be expected from FG’s regulatory inputs.

The method we introduce, PARADIGM-SHIFT, detects a
difference in the expected activity of a gene in its downstream
neighborhood relative to what is expected given its upstream
neighborhood. It makes use of two key pieces of information: (i)
the known genetic interactions of a gene; and (ii) the activation
or deactivation of these interacting genes to gauge the impact of
a mutational event. Since the method uses the data of a sample to
contrast the predicted regulatory input from the downstream output
of a gene it should provide somewhat orthogonal information for
annotating mutations than other approaches.

2 METHODS

We derive a PARADIGM SHIFT (P-Shift) score based on the intuition of
comparing the observed downstream consequences of a gene’s activity to
what is expected from its regulatory inputs. The P-Shift has the form:

ObservedQ”) )

Expected (f) (1)

PS 0” ) = log <
where the ‘expected’ activity of f is derived from the upstream regulators
and the ‘observed’ activity of f is derived from the downstream targets. The
caveat of course is that we never get to observe gene f ’s activity so we must
infer it from the activity of its downstream targets, and these activities in a
necessarily recursive fashion. The computation can be framed as an inference
problem over a set of interdependent variables, some of which are hidden.
In the last couple of decades, efﬁcient procedures have been developed to
compute the probabilities of a system of random variables connected together
in a probabilistic graphical model [see (Friedman, 2004) for a review].

We previously described a factor-graph-based approach for integrating
diverse types of omics data with genetic pathways called PARADIGM (Vaske
at al., 2010). We brieﬂy summarize the approach here. PARADIGM assesses
the activity of a gene in the context of a genetic pathway diagram ¢ by
drawing inferences from a dataset of observations D. The pathway diagram
¢ describes connections between hidden gene expression variables, their
corresponding observational data, and any regulatory inputs and outputs.
Variables are connected to each other by factors, which encode probabilistic
dependencies constraining mutually connected variables. The dataset can
include multiple different types of measurements for a patient sample such

Fig. 2. Overview of the PARADIGM-SHIFT method. Inference is centered
on a PG for which mutations have been detected in one or more samples.
First, a local neighborhood around FG is isolated from the full pathway.
PARADIGM is run in two modes using only the local neighborhood. A
‘Regulators Run” infers the activity of PG using only its upstream regulators
in the local neighborhood; a ‘Targets Run” infers FG’s activity using only
downstream targets. Finally, the difference between these two runs is
calculated and used as the P-Shift Score. In this case, LOF is predicted
because the downstream targets indicate lower activity than the upstream
regulators of PG

as gene expression and genomic copy number variation. Before supplying
the data to PARADIGM, each dataset type is ﬁrst transformed into rank-
ratios. This is done by rankng all values across all samples from smallest
to largest and then each rank r is transformed into the range [0.1] by the
formula (r— l)/(N>i<G— l) where N is the number of samples and G is the
number of genes measured. All data and hidden states are represented in
PARADIGM as ternary random variables in which the value x” encodes
more active in the tumor than normal, xi more inactive in the tumor and x0
equal levels. Brieﬂy, PARADIGM then uses a belief-propagation algorithm
on a factor graph derived from ¢ to compute inferred pathway levels (IPLs)
for each gene, complex, protein family and cellular process by combining
gene expression, copy number and genetic interactions. The IPL for a gene
is a signed log-posterior odds (LPOs) of the state of the gene given the
observed data. Positive IPLs reﬂect how much more likely the gene is active
in the tumor, whereas negative IPLs reﬂect the negative log probability of
how likely the gene is inactive in the tumor relative to normal.

Our contribution here is the development of a method that can predict the
impact of a mutation in a tumor sample using two calls to the PARADIGM
algorithm for each mutated gene. We ﬁrst describe the computation of a score
that reﬂects the predicted neutrality, loss- or GOF of a mutational event. The
method provides a prediction for each gene and each sample in the cohort and
thereby provides a sample- or patient-speciﬁc assessment of the functional
impact of a mutation. The computation assumes a local pathway context
for the gene is given. However, the second section describes how a gene’s
pathway context is selected. Finally, we describe how we then compute
cohort-wide measures of signiﬁcance to determine if a gene is more often
involved in loss- or GOF events.

2.1 Computation of the P-Shift score

The core of our approach estimates a P-Shift score for each tumor sample
and for each FG using two runs of the original PARADIGM algorithm
(Fig. 2). We refer to these two runs as the Regulators-only and the Targets-
only runs (R-run and T-run for short). In the R-run, a neighborhood of
upstream regulators is left connected to PG but all downstream targets are
disconnected. The inferences derived from the R-run reﬂect the expected
level of PG given the state of its regulators in a particular sample. In the T-
run, FG is left connected to a neighborhood of its downstream targets while
upstream regulators are disconnected. The P-Shift score then computes the
difference between the inferred activities of PG determined in the T-run from
those determined in the R-run.

To estimate pathway-neighborhood dependent inferences on FG f’s
activity, we restrict our View of the data to subsets of features in ¢ and supply

these as arguments to D. Let R C 11) be the set of regulators of f and T C 11) be
the set of targets. The selection of T and R is described in the next sub-section
and assumed given here. Let D(R),D(T) and D(f) refer to the data observed
for the regulators, targets and the PG f , respectively. The interactions are
restricted to the subset of features in the FG’s neighborhood and denoted
¢(T) to represent the pathway features and interactions involving only the
targets to each other and to f itself. Similarly, ¢(R) represents the same for
the upstream regulators. With these deﬁnitions in hand we write the P-Shift
score as the following log ratio of two constituent likelihood-ratios:

LR (D(T) lxj‘e’ 7 MD)
LR(D(R).D(f)IX}'~ ¢(R))

where LR(Y|x",Z) is deﬁned as P(le”,Z)/P(Y|xT”,Z), the likelihood ratio
computed over one possible alternative value for X ,x” , compared with the
probability of the other two possible valuesiless active in tumor xi and
similarly active in tumor xoithe combined event is written for short. Note
that only the expected term in the denominator contains the entry D0”), which
represents the actual data for the PG of interest. This reﬂects the assumption
that the data on the PG provides evidence for the cit-regulatory state of the
gene and so is included among the regulators of f . Note that if data on the
direct activity of f were instead available, such as phosphorylation status or
enzymatic activity, then that data could be considered for inclusion into the
numerator term for the observed targets. The quantity in Equation (2) reﬂects
the degree to which the observed data for the targets is consistent with high
activity of the PG relative to the observed data for the regulators and the
gene in question.

Further expansion of the P-Shift score reveals the method by which it
can be computed using the original PARADIGM algorithm. Application of
Bayes Rule gives:

1990").lew |¢(T)) l 1”(D(R)~D(1“")~xjc'w ¢(R)) .
— o — r
P(D(T).Xf_" |¢(T)) P(D(R)~D(F)~Xf"~¢(R)) p

PS(f) = log < (2)

 

PS(f)=log<
(3)

where prior is the log-prior-odds and has the same form as the ﬁrst two terms
in the equation except that all entries involving D are dropped. Another
application of Bayes Rule would show that the ﬁrst two joint probability
ratio terms are equivalent to the LPO that the gene is active given either the
state of the downstream targets (left-hand term) or the upstream regulators
(right-hand term). The advantage of writing the joint probabilities in this
form shows explicitly those terms of the form P(D, x | ¢) that are each
efﬁciently computed with a message-passing belief propagation procedure
on the underlying factor graph encoded by ¢. The message-passing procedure
sums out all of the hidden variables present in ¢7the states of complexes,
cellular processes and the activities of all other genes other than f. The
computation implements an iterative form of the ExpectationiMaximization
procedure that sequentially updates all variables by forming a running
average until either a convergence tolerance of 10‘9 is reached or 10 000
maximum iterations are exceeded. The code is freely available through the
libDAI C++ open source library (Mooij, 2010). In the R-run version of
PARADIGM, the LPO shown in Equation (3) and its corresponding log-
prior odds are computed in two separate full factor graph convergence runs.
Likewise, the T-run involves two separate EM runs to compute its two terms
in Equation (3). Thus, in total, the computation time involved to compute
the P-Shift requires four EM convergence runs, but each task is run on
a reduced pathway representation involving only the neighborhood of the
FG. Thus, the computation time to calculate a P-Shift for an entire dataset
requires 2k PARADIGM runs where k is the number of mutated genes in the
cohort, usually on the order of dozens with a minimum frequency of exonic
mutations.

In practice, we use the IPLs from PARADIGM for the computation of the
P-Shift. Speciﬁcally, we set PS(f)=IPLT(f)-IPLR(f), where IPLT1R(f) is the
IPL derived from the T- or R-run. The IPL is a signed LPO that always puts
the highest probability state for f in the numerator. If the inactive state is in
the numerator the IPL gives the negation of the LPO. This quantity is similar

to Equation (3) except that the highest probability states determined in each
run are contrasted. In the case where the active form of the gene is the most
probable in each case the two formulas are equivalent. Finally, we found
that a transformation of the P-Shift score to a Z-score provided better overall
results. Each gene’s local neighborhood could have a certain bias to lean
toward either positive or negative scores. To account for this, we constructed
100 random samples for each gene by shufﬂing data tuples around ¢. This
effectively associates random data with each gene’s neighborhood. P-Shifts
were calculated for each of these 100 samples and each P-Shift was then
normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation
determined from this simulation. We henceforth refer to these P-Shift Z-
scores simply as the P-Shifts.

2.2 Selection of the local pathway context

Rather than use the full set of interactions in the SuperPathway, the set of
regulators R and targets T are selected from a local neighborhood L around
each gene to make computation feasible. All interactions between the selected
features are included in the neighborhood. If a protein is present in both
the upstream and downstream neighborhoods due to feedback circuitry it
is excluded from both the R- and T-runs. To build the neighborhood, we
traverse the graph and include any pathway features (proteins, families,
complexes and processes) if there exists a path from the neighbor to PG
that includes no more than k intervening proteins. We expect L to provide a
good approximation of the full network, as genes further away will exert a
diminishing inﬂuence on the inference of the FG To test this intuition, we
repeated all analyses on the positive controls with k= 0, 1, 2, 3 and L set to
the full network. As expected, we found that including genes further away
from the PG provided little inﬂuence on the P-Shift score with k > 1 showing
little difference (data not shown). To enrich the neighborhood for genes with
informative data we used a simple variance ﬁlter in which neighbors in
L having less than a 0.10 standard deviation in the rank-ratio-transformed
expression data were excluded.

To further test the method and shed light on comparisons with gene
expression-signature-based approaches, we also implemented a supervised
neighborhood selection step. Neighbors in L are selected if their expression
values have a minimum covariance with the presence and absence of
PG mutations in a training set. Five-fold cross-validation is performed in
which a Student’s t-statistic is calculated for each gene in L using 80% of
the samples and those with at least a t-statistic of 1.0 are retained. This
amounts to applying a relaxed Fisher criterion as a feature selection step for
classiﬁcation. The P-Shift scores for PG are then calculated over the held-
out 20% of the samples in the test set. The process is repeated for each fold.
The same cross-validation partitioning was used to train a Support-Vector
Machine (SVM) to represent a competing gene expression signature-based
approach for comparison (Supplementary Fig. 54A).

2.3 Datasets and pathway sources

We downloaded gene expression, copy number and exome-capture mutation
data for patient tumor samples from the TCGA data coordinating center for
185 glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) samples on 7/28/11, 354 ovarian serous
denocarcinoma (OVCA) samples on 7/28/11, 219 colorectal carcinoma
(CRC) samples on 7/28/11, 184 lung squamous carcinoma (LUSC) samples
on 10/26/11 and 525 breast carcinoma (BRCA) samples on 9/24/11. Datasets
for each tissue-speciﬁc tumor type were used separately as the dataset
D for inferring mutation P-Shifts. We formed a comprehensive cellular
pathway diagram for ¢ by merging together several pathway sources into a
superimposed pathway henceforth referred to as the ‘SuperPathway’ (Heiser
at al., 2011).

genes including RBI, TP53 and NFE2L2. The retinoblastoma (RB 1)

gene is a well-known tumor suppressor gene and plays a crucial role
in the control of the G1—>S transition of the cell cycle. We applied
our method to predict the functional consequences of mutations
to RBI in the GBM cohort. Neighborhood selection identiﬁed 6
proteins in the upstream neighborhood of RBl and 10 downstream
targets. The expression data, mutation status of RB 1, and the
inferences from the T- and R-runs for this neighborhood are shown
as integrated CircleMaps in Figure 3A. Of these, 6 out of 9 samples
received negative P-Shiﬁs consistent with RB 1 ’s characterized role
as a tumor suppressor. At a ﬁxed FPR (a = 0.10), 4 out of 9 RBl
mutants are detected with a one-sided test.

We asked whether the distribution of P-Shiﬁ scores were
signiﬁcant by computing a mutant separation t-statistic (m-sep)
comparing the P-Shifts associated with the mutated samples to the
P-Shiﬁs associated to those samples without reported RB 1 mutations
(Fig. 3B). It is important to note that the unsupervised version of the
method makes no use of the mutation calls in any way when deriving
the score. Although most of the samples received negative P-Shiﬁs,
a number of RB 1 mutations had scores closer to the mean of the non-
mutated cases. These events may reﬂect neutral passenger mutations
that happen to land in the RBl gene, or might reﬂect heterozygous
as opposed to homozygous events.

Although the m-seps indicate that the distributions of the P-Shiﬁ
scores are appreciably lower for the mutants compared with the non-
mutants, we performed a permutation analysis to assess whether the
observed m-seps are signiﬁcant using a non-parametric approach.
We formed random neighborhoods for RBl by assigning data tuples
from random genes to the regulators and targets of RB 1. Using 1000
different sets of randomly assigned neighbors the entire procedure
was repeated and the difference between the mutant and non-mutant
distributions were computed. This test indeed revealed that the lower
P-Shiﬁs observed for the mutant RBl samples were signiﬁcantly
lower than the non-mutants relative to those differences seen in
random controls (Fig. 3B, inset).

TP53 is the most commonly mutated gene in cancer. It is a
tumor suppressor and in most cases dominant negative mutations
or deletion of the gene resulting from loss of heterozygosity (LOH)
or double somatic events are observed as early and frequent events in
cancers spanning many tissue types. We compared our algorithm’s
ability with predict the ﬁinctional impact of TP53 mutations in
OVCA and GBM available through the TCGA consortium. In GBM,
nearly a third (48) of the samples have a mutation in TP53. Of
these, 19 had negative P-Shiﬁs, 9 had positive P-Shiﬁs and the
rest had near-neutral as determined by permutation analysis. In
OVCA, the majority (67%) of the samples had a reported TP53
mutation. Importantly, it is believed that nearly 100% of the samples
harbor such a mutation even though less than 100% were detected
(Consortium, 2011). Figure 3C shows the CircleMap view of TP53’s
data, inferred activities from T- and R-runs, and its P-Shift scores.
It is clear that the P-Shifts in the left-hand side, corresponding to
the mutated cases, are enriched for lower scores, consistent with a
LOF prediction for this gene. The difference in P-Shiﬁs for mutated
versus non-mutated were again found to be signiﬁcantly left-shifted
(Supplementary Fig. SlA, m-sep = — 10.9).

To gauge the utility of the method in predicting GOF
mutations on a known proto-oncogene, we applied our method
to mutations in NFE2L2 in lung squamous cell carcinoma.
NFE2L2 is a transcription factor that directs response to stress
and oxidative damage in cells. Activating mutations in speciﬁc

the positive P-Shiﬁs seen for the mutated cases relative to the non-
mutated cases were signiﬁcant. Thus, our method was able to predict
a positive increase in activity of this gene relative to its regulatory
inputs consistent with the known constitutively activating inﬂuence
of these mutations.

To gauge the general agreement with predicting ﬁinctional
impacts for mutated genes that are considered to be driver rather than
neutral passenger events, we compared our approach with MutSig
(Getz et al., 2007). MutSig considers the frequency of the mutation,
the location of the mutation in the gene, and several other features to
calculate signiﬁcance score relative to an estimated sample-speciﬁc
background mutation rate. We collected all MutSig scores for those
genes that had representation in the SuperPathway and that had at
least three mutations in GBM. We used the absolute value of the
average of the P-Shiﬁs and dividing them into two groups according
to whether they were associated with signiﬁcant or insigniﬁcant
MutSig scores (Fig. 4). The results show a clear enrichment for
higher absolute P-Shiﬁs (either indicative of GOF or LOF) for
those genes with signiﬁcant MutSig scores compared to those with
insigniﬁcant scores.

Next, to determine a rough estimate for the speciﬁcity of our
approach, we collected six of the genes that received insigniﬁcant
MutSig scores on which to perform the aforementioned permutation
analysis. We plotted the P-Shiﬁs from the permuted samples and
found that in each of the six cases, the calculated m-seps fell well
within the range seen in the permuted controls (Supplementary Fig.
S2). We ﬁnd that these mutations in genes with low MutSig scores
are associated with P-Shiﬁs that do not discriminate between mutant
and non-mutant samples, consistent with the assumption that many
of these mutations represent passenger events. Thus, our pathway-
based method shows a degree of conﬁrmation to a purely sequence-
based analysis of mutational events.

As discussed above, most methods to assess signiﬁcance of
mutations in a given gene rely heavily on the prevalence of mutations
across a clinical cohort with shared characteristics (e.g. early
stage colon cancer). However, some rare events are of paramount
importance to the patients in whom they occur, such as in the Ras-
MAPK pathway in GBM. To determine novel impactful events,
we applied PARADIGM-SHIFT to all of the mutated genes in
GBM, OVCA and LUSC. For each cohort, we calculated all P-
Shiﬁs, computed an average P-Shift for each gene, and plotted
these averages as ‘waterfall’ plots to highlight examples of predicted
gains- and losses-of—function (Fig. SA—C).

Our analysis identiﬁed probable GOF mutations in MAPKl based
on only 3 out of 171 samples sequenced in GBM (Fig. SA). All three
lie in the protein kinase domain and two are predicted to change the
kinase function due to their occurrence in highly conserved residues
in the kinase, suggesting kinase inhibitors targeting the ERK proteins
in select cases may be effective. CDKN2A is a well-known tumor
suppressor whose loss, primarily through homozygous copy number
deletion, is an early driver of oncogenesis. Thus it is consistent that
our method predicts LOF for this important tumor suppressor in
both GBM and LUSC (Fig. 5B) for those cases in which the gene
is present but mutated. Counter to expectation, our method assigns
a positive score to NFl, which is a well-known tumor suppressor
gene whose loss in GBM also deﬁnes a distinct transcriptional
subtype {PMID: 20129251 }. Thus, pathway utilization likely differs
substantially not only between mutant and wt cases, but also between
cancer subtypes, possibly making analysis of such marker events
complex.

In addition to NFE2L2 discussed earlier, analysis of the LUSC
cohort (Fig. 5C) also reveals potentially therapeutically important
targets in select cases. PIK3C2G, for example, may act as a driver
in a handful of patients and could in theory be targeted by AKT
pathway inhibitors or rapalogs. The low negative value of HUWEl,
a less well-studied E3 ligase, suggests this enzyme might play a role
analogous to that of CUL3 in degrading NFE2L2 in some cases.

PARADIGM-SHIFT applied to the ovarian dataset also gave
informative insights into this tumor type. Nearly all samples harbor
TP53 mutations (n = 179). The P-Shiﬁs were mostly negative for
TP53 consistent with the expected LOF of this tumor suppressor. In
addition, our analysis may clarify potentially important directional
information about pathway alterations. For example, the EPH
receptor family is known to participate in bidirectional signaling
(Aoto and Chen, 2007). The high absolute differences in the
shift scores for this diverse family in the ovarian cohort may
reﬂect functionally opposing roles of these bidirectional receptors
in oncogenesis.

PARADIGM-SHIFT

 

Finally, we asked whether the PARADIGM-SHIFT method
provides complementary information to current techniques by
comparing it to both a gene-expression signature-based and several
popular sequence-based approaches. The absolute P-Shift score was
used as an indicator for the presence of a mutation. To further
inform the comparison of the method to a gene-signature-based
approach a supervised version of the P-Shift was implemented
based on a t-test and referred to as P-Shiﬁ-t (see Section 2). For
the gene expression-signature-based approach a linear kernel SVM
was used. Two SVM models were trained—one that used the entire
set of genes in the dataset and a second that used only the genes
in the local neighborhood L. Supplementary Fig. S4A shows the
results of predicting the presence/absence of the mutation with the
P-Shift and P-Shiﬁ-t methods compared with the SVM for the three
positive control genes. The t-test supervision does seem to either
help or provide comparable performance (e.g. TP53) compared
with the original unsupervised P-Shiﬁ. Interestingly, the SVM-based
approaches limited to the P-Shiﬁ neighbors outperformed the ﬁill
set of features in all these cases. In addition, except for RBl, both
variants of the P-Shiﬁ give lower performance than the SVM-based
approach.

We compared P-Shift with four different approaches including
SIFT (Kumar et al., 2009), PolyPhen2 (Adzhubei et al., 2010)
and MutationAssessor (Reva et al., 2007). CONDEL (Gonzalez-
Perez and Lopez-Bigas, 2011) was also included as it produces an
integrated call by combining the above three methods. We calculated
the Pearson’s correlation between each of the methods and between
each of the methods to the absolute P-Shift and displayed the results
as a heatmap (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Not surprisingly, due to the
heavy sequence-based nature of the previous methods, they all have
higher correlations among themselves than they do to P-Shift. Still,
a moderate level of correlation was observed between P-Shiﬁ and
sequence-based methods, achieving the highest level (0.30) with
the integrated CONDEL method. Thus, our method may provide
novel viewpoints on mutations that can be used in conjunction with
sequence-based methods.

4 DISCUSSION

Our approach uses different information compared with protein-
sequence-based approaches. It enables probing into infrequent
events and can be used to detect the impact of non-coding mutations.
In addition, it may be useﬁil for detecting those cases that harbor
passenger mutations where the mutation is either neutral or the cell
has compensated somehow to keep the surrounding pathway intact.
Finally, since our approach couples single gene mutation events
with broader pathway activation signatures, it could be used to
place genes with unknown/little known ﬁinction and provocative
mutations, into new pathways, as suggested by the case of HUWEl.

The method we describe has several limitations. Although
absolute P-Shiﬁs show a good overall correlation with MutSig,
several of the genes seem to have predictions on average in the
opposite direction than expected (e.g. NF1 in GBM). Complex
regulatory logic surrounding the gene may show a discrepancy but
the direction of the discrepancy may not always be clear. It will
take further investigation into these cases to determine if a reliable
direction can be inferred from the sign of the P-Shiﬁ score.

The selection of the upstream and downstream pathways are
key steps for accurate prediction of events in individual samples.

Because of the combinatorial complexity of the selection problem,
research is needed to determine a neighborhood that gives
maximum performance at identifying the presence and absence of
mutations. Our results do indicate that even mild supervision of
the neighborhood selection step gives slightly better performance.
In addition, an SVM gene expression signature-based approach
provides higher accuracy in predicting the presence/absence of
mutations. Since the SVM cannot be used to gauge the loss- versus
GOF of a gene, using the P-Shiﬁ together with the SVM might
improve the discrimination between mutant and non-mutant samples
as indicated in Supplementary Fig. S4A but it will be interesting
to see if the directionality of the shift is also improved. In this
investigation, it would be informative to perturb neighborhood
members, connections, parameters and neighborhood selection
policies to measure how the performance varies to errors in the
pathways.

Finally, the method can only be applied to genes with sufﬁcient
representation in the curated set of pathway interactions. Although
current pathway databases have a biased coverage of cancer-related
genes, many of the genes with low-frequency mutations are still
among those with little pathway information. It is critical to expand
pathways beyond the curated set to encompass such orphan genes
into the analysis of mutation consequences. Indeed, current efforts
are underway to expand pathway databases by including high-
throughput functional genomics results (Wu et al., 2010). These
efforts should greatly improve the breadth of genes to which
pathway-based mutation impact approaches can be applied.

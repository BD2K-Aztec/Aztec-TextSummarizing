ABSTRACT

Motivation: CRISPR RNAs (chNAs) are a type of small non-coding
RNA that form a key part of an acquired immune system in prokary-
otes. Specific prediction methods find chNA—encoding loci in nearly
half of sequenced bacterial, and three quarters of archaeal, species.
These Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats
(CRISPR) arrays consist of repeat elements alternating with specific
spacers. Generally one strand is transcribed, producing long pre-
chNAs, which are processed to short chNAs that base pair with
invading nucleic acids to facilitate their destruction. No current soft-
ware for the discovery of CRISPR loci predicts the direction of chNA
transcription.

Results: We have developed an algorithm that accurately predicts the
strand of the resulting chNAs. The method uses as input CRISPR
repeat predictions. CRISPRDirection uses parameters that are calcu-
lated from the CRISPR repeat predictions and flanking sequences,
which are combined by weighted voting. The prediction may use
prior coding sequence annotation but this is not required.
CRISPRDirection correctly predicted the orientation of 94% of a ref-
erence set of arrays.

1 INTRODUCTION

Many bacteria and archaea have defense systems that target in-
coming nucleic acids, termed CRISPR-Cas (Clustered Regularly
Interspaced Short Palindromic RepeatsiCRISPR-associated
proteins) systems. Recent studies have shown that these RNA-
mediated systems are a major antiviral mechanism in prokary-
otes (Fineran and Charpentier, 2012; Makarova et al., 2013;
Sorek et al., 2013; Wiedenheft et al., 2012).

In bacterial genomic sequences, CRISPRs are characterized by
repeated elements (repeats) interspersed with unique spacers. In
most systems, RNA Polymerase transcribes the CRISPR array
in one direction to produce the pre-CRISPR RNA (pre-chNA),
which is processed to provide separate small RNA effectors
(chNAs) that target foreign genetic elements (Lillestol et al.,

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

2009; Richter et al., 2012a). The mechanism of targeting requires
a number of Cas (CRISPR-associated proteins) that are typically
encoded nearby to the CRISPR arrays. Most CRISPR-Cas sys-
tems target DNA from bacteriophages, plasmids and mobile
elements in bacterial chromosomes (Brodt et al., 2011;
Makarova et al., 2013; Sorek et al., 2013); however, some
CRISPR-Cas systems target RNA (Hale et al., 2009).

The direction of transcription is unknown for most CRISPR
arrays, and current algorithms do not predict direction.
Normally, only one strand is transcribed and processed into
small chNAs, which determines base pairing target speciﬁcity.
The chNAs provide target speciﬁcity through base pairing for
the CRISPR-Cas system. Therefore, target prediction algorithms
permit both potential chNAs to be analyzed, as the correct
strand is often unknown (Biswas et al., 2013).

There are several CRISPR discovery programs available to
ﬁnd these repeat arrays in genomic (Bland et al., 2007; Edgar,
2007; Grissa et al., 2007; Rousseau et al., 2009) or metagenomic
sequences (Rho et al., 2012; Skennerton et al., 2013). The most
cited of these (CRISPRFinder) locates CRISPR arrays in 46%
(1080 in 2355) of the complete genomes of bacteria and in 84%
(126 in 150) of archaea. As CRT and PILER-CR are better
suited to automation, they are used in bacterial genome annota-
tion pipelines (Mavromatis et al., 2009).

Recent CRISPR-Cas classiﬁcations include three types (17111)
and at least ten subtypes aVIakarova et al., 2011). These are
based on multiple criteria, including the presence of specific
Cas proteins. For those type III-B systems that target single-
stranded RNA, appropriate assignment of the direction of
CRISPR expression is essential to accurately identify RNA tar-
gets and avoid false target predictions. Whereas for type I and 11,
additional short specific sequences are associated 5/ or 3/ of true
targets and function in different steps of the CRISPR-Cas pro-
cess. These sequences are termed protospacer adjacent motifs
(Mojica et al., 2009), and recent work has suggested that these
can be further discriminated into target interference motifs and
spacer acquisition motifs that function at the different stages
(Shah et al., 2013). The identiﬁcation of these additional deter-
minants requires knowledge of the transcribed strand (Biswas
et al., 2013; Shah et al., 2013). The ability to accurately identify
the target strand would also be useful to determine if during
conjugation the single strand initially transferred into the recipi-
ent is preferentially targeted (Westra et al., 2013).

Repeats may be dissimilar between the same types in different
species, and the relationship between sequence and type is com-
plex, i.e. near identical repeats in the same species can be

associated with different types, e.g. LB and III-B (Nickel et al.,
2013), and multiple types commonly exist with a species
(Makarova et al., 2011). However, repeats can independently
be clustered and grouped into sequence or structural classes
(Kunin et al., 2007). The most recent analysis puts 3527 repeats
into 33 structural motif classes, 40 sequence family classes and 6
superclasses. Some of these classes are preferentially associated
with specific CRISPR subtypes (Lange et al., 2013).

In some types (I and II), the repeat RNA has a stable stem
loop, typically with 4P6 bases in the stem (Nickel et al., 2013;
Scholz et al., 2013). Pre-chNA processing occurs within the
repeat, resulting in 5/ and 3/ handles derived from the repeats
and attached to the spacer (Fig. 1). This repeat structure within
the pre-chNA is required for processing in type I-F systems
(Sternberg et al., 2012). In some systems, the 5/ chNA handle
is UAAGAAA derived from the 3/ end of the repeat (Maier
et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2011). In addition, it has recently
been shown that for a few species using type II systems,
chNA transcription can occur from multiple promoter se-
quences (TANAAT —10 like) within the 3/ end of the repeat
(Zhang et al., 2013).

CRISPR arrays expand by acquiring speciﬁc sequences from
invading nucleic acids. Although it is not completely understood,
this adaptation typically involves addition of new spacers at the
5/ end of the array (Fineran and Charpentier, 2012; He and
Deem, 2010; Lillestol et al., 2009; Westra and Brouns, 2012).
However, there is evidence of some systems acquiring new spa-
cers at positions internal to the CRISPR array (Erdmann and
Garrett, 2012). Spacers and repeats may subsequently degener-
ate, then be lost by successive point mutations, deletions or re-
combination (Gudbergsdottir et al., 2011; He and Deem, 2010).
However, as clear targets of most chNAs are not present in
sequence databases, it is difﬁcult to determine if mutations
have occurred in spacers. In addition, it is likely that both
target nucleic acids and host chNAs are accumulating muta-
tions after the initial contact and spacer acquisition (Levin et al.,

Fig. 1. Overview of the methods used in CRISPRDirection. Arrays were
predicted using CRT and PILER-CR. An array with 11 repeats Rar is
shown. Parameters were calculated from the repeats or using ﬂanking
regions, e.g. the distance to the next annotated protein CDS (arrows)
(Section 2). Relative AT% in the ﬂanks was determined in ﬁxed windows.
For each array, a representative repeat was determined and then assessed
for motifs, composition and secondary structure (Section 2)

2013; Sun et al., 2013; Weinberger et al., 2012). For example,
phages can escape CRISPR-Cas interference via the acquisition
of point mutations in their target sequences, and old spacers
might accumulate mutations when there is no longer a selective
advantage (i.e. in the absence of the target phage/plasmid) (Levin
et al., 2013; Vercoe et al., 2013).

The ‘leader’ is the sequence that precedes the array and con-
tains both the promoter and 5/ region before the first repeat
(Pougach et al., 2010; Przybilski et al., 2011). In some character-
ized systems, there is clear accumulation of point mutations in
the repeats (and spacers) at the 3/ end of the array (leader-distal
end). Consistent with this observation, current data indicate that
new spacers are acquired at the 5/ (leader) end of the CRISPR
array, and older spacers and repeats decay at the 3/ end (trailer
end spacers) (Swarts et al., 2012; Weinberger et al., 2012; Yosef
et al., 2012).

Previous studies have predicted the direction of repeats as
parts of larger studies. It has been observed that repeats in ar-
chaea are A-rich and this has been used to determine direction in
that domain (Chan et al., 2012; Shah and Garrett, 2011).
Recently, Lange et a]. (2013) used A-richness, and the presence
of ATTGAAA(C/G) at the 3/ end of repeats, to determine the
direction of repeats (Lange et al., 2013).

In this article, we aimed to use information within, and
nearby, predicted CRISPR arrays to determine the direction of
transcription. Prediction was performed as much as possible in-
dependently of the use of biological knowledge (e. g. repeat class),
as this is not known for many sequences. The algorithm is
described and available as a Perl module for a gene prediction
and annotation pipeline. This CRISPRDirection algorithm pre-
dicts with >90% accuracy the direction of transcription and thus
the correct sequences of the chNAs that target foreign nucleic
acids. CRISPRDirection will be useful for more accurate predic-
tion of CRISPR arrays, and subsequent prediction of their types
and targets, such as via CRISPRTarget (Biswas et al., 2013).

2 METHODS
2.1 Preprocessing of arrays

2.1.] Prediction of arrays Arrays were predicted with
CRISPRFinder, PILER-CR and CRT on complete bacterial (2341 spe-
cies with 4458 sequences) and archaeal (153 species with 236 sequences)
genomes using the default parameters (Bland et al., 2007; Edgar, 2007;
Grissa et al., 2007). Only CRISPR arrays with two or more spacers (i.e.
three or more repeats) were used in the analyses. The three programs
predicted 4053, 3471 and 3166 CRISPRs, respectively. There was partial
or full overlap between all three predictions for 3115 arrays. Because
arrays predicted with CRISPRFinder do not show variation in individual
repeats in the ﬁnal output, and its dependencies are not freely available,
the CRISPRFinder-predicted arrays were not used. Because similar
arrays were often predicted by CRT and FILER-CR, only the longer
ones were used from the combined list of predictions. For overlapping
predictions, the longest array was selected. The ﬁnal list included 3571
CRISPR arrays. Those pipelines that include CRISPR annotation use a
similar methodology.

2.1.2 Identifying representative repeat sequences As the PILER-
CR output format provides most of the information required by
CRISPRDirection, we converted the CRT-predicted arrays into
PILER-CR format. However, as CRT does not provide a representative

repeat, we had to determine this for the arrays predicted by CRT. To ﬁnd
the representative/centroid repeat for each array, we used a match-scoring
method, then the frequency of individual repeats. We ﬁrst collected all the
repeat sequences of an array and the number of individual occurrences in
the array. At this stage if two repeats have single base difference, they
were treated as two separate sequences. We initially selected the sequence
with the least mismatches as the representative repeat. Where two or
more sequences had the same degeneracy score, the most common
repeat was selected. If these were equal, the repeat with fewer mismatches
at the ends of the array was selected. The representative repeats were
collected from the 3571 arrays, and after identical or reverse comple-
mented repeats were removed, there were 2023 unique repeats.

2.1.3 Reference set of arrays and repeat sequences To develop a
reference set of CRISPRs with known orientation, a set of 26 repeats with
experimentally determined direction was used, 13 repeats were taken from
Biswas et al. (2013) and supplemented with 13 repeats from the recent
literature (Supplementary Table Sl). These were chosen to cover each of
the 10 subtypes and a range of structural and sequence classes (Section 4
and Supplementary Material S3) (Kunin et al., 2007; Lange et al., 2013).
There were 208 arrays containing these exact 26 repeats.

To generate a larger reference set of arrays for our analysis, we searched
the 2023 repeats for sequences similar to the 26 repeats of known orien-
tation. In this comparison, repeats with a maximum of three mismatching
bases were retained. This gave us a set of 120 unique repeats that were
present in 575 distinct arrays (Supplementary Table SS).

We removed arrays with >95% sequence identity using CD-HIT-EST
(Supplementary Table S2). This reduced the number of arrays to 460
arrays, 340 from 205 bacterial and 120 from 43 archaeal species. These
460 arrays were used as a reference set in our analyses.

2.2 Calculation of parameters

We derived and used a number of parameters and attributes from the
repeats and regions immediately ﬂanking the array. Each of these sets of
parameters was used as a method to predict the direction of the array as
either F (Forward) or R (Reverse). For some methods all 460 arrays
could be used, and for others, not all arrays were suitable for the analysis.

If the array was not valid for the analysis, or the analysis results in a
draw, it reports NP (No Prediction). For example, if there are no muta-
tions in an array, the reported direction by the method dependent on
these will be NP (Supplementary Fig. S4). A set of 100 CRISPR arrays
were selected randomly in each run and the set is used for all the methods.
This was repeated 100 times. The mean Positive Predictive Value (PPV)
was calculated using resampling by re-substitution, as n is much larger
than the number of predictors to be estimated. An alternative method
of resampling by 10-fold cross-validation is provided in Supplementary
File S2, which produced similar predictors and scores:l:0.03. As the
random probability of getting a true prediction is 0.50, we used as a
weighted score (score) for each method its PPV minus 0.50.

2.2.] Screen for ATTGAAA-like sequences The sequence
ATTGAAA and variants shown in Table 1 were searched for individually
on both strands of the representative repeat (Fig. 1). Any single base, or
no base, was allowed following the motif, to allow for inaccuracy in
prediction of the repeat/spacer transition in tuning the algorithm.

2.2.2 Biased nucleotide composition in the 5’ and 3’ ﬂanks relative
AT richness In testing, we compared the percentage of nucleotides A
and T (AT%) in different length windows ranging from 15 to 165 nu-
cleotides with a step of 15 nucleotides ﬂanking the 5’ and 3’ ends of the
arrays (Fig. 1). The AT% in each of these regions were compared, in
testing, to determine if they have an absolute minimum percentage dif-
ference ranging from 0.5 to 14.5%. When the AT differences for windows
were greater than the minimum cutoff, a prediction was obtained.

For example, if the 5’ end of the array showed a higher AT% for a
window size (e.g. 135) and minimum cutoff (e.g. 2.5%) the prediction
was F. Similarly, the predicted direction will be R when the 3’ end of the
array shows a higher AT% than the 5’ end of the array. For all other
cases, NPs are reported.

2.2.3 Degeneracy at the 3’ end of the array The array was divided
into three sections: 5’, middle and 3’ sections, each with an equal number
of repeats, where possible, or the nearest integer. For arrays with three or
four repeats, both 5’ and 3’ sections had one repeat each. Of the 460
arrays, 164 had no mutations in the array and were excluded from this
analysis. The remaining 296 had one or more mutations and a direction
could be predicted. We calculated the total number of mutations present
in these sections. In this analysis, a base was denoted as mutated only
when it differed from an adjacent repeat (Supplementary Table S2). This
rule of mutation was necessary as many long CRISPR arrays were shown
to have a point mutation, which is propagated to the next repeats, result-
ing in two common repeats in a single array. Often, both the repeats were
found to have more than one-third of repeats associated with them,
making it difﬁcult to select one as the representative repeat.

The score for the 5’ and 3’ sections were calculated in the following
manner: 5’ section score = Total number of mutations + Observed muta-
tion in the first repeat; 3’ section score: Total number of
mutations+ Observed mutation in the last repeat.

The ‘observed mutation in the ﬁrst/last repeat’ can either be True (1) or
False (0), and this was useful to correctly identify the direction when the
total number of mutations in both 5’ and 3’ section was equal. The end
with the lowest score was predicted to be the 5’ end.

2.2.4 Potential for RNA secondary structure in the repeat For
this analysis, we ﬁrst removed the redundant repeats from the sample
(Supplementary Table S2) and used RNAfold to measure the Minimum
Free Energy (MFE) of the repeats in both directions (Hofacker et al.,
1994). In addition, we masked bases from 0 to 11 bases from both ends
and calculated the MFE of the center part of the repeats and their reverse
complements. The direction with the lowest free energy for those with
differences of >0.5kcal/mol was designated as forward.

2.2.5 A relative to T in the repeat A/ T ratio For this analysis, the
relative number of A to T in the representative repeat was measured and
the direction with the highest A/T ratio designated as forward.

2.2.6 Distance to the next coding gene at the 5’ and 3’ end length of
leader analysis Using the start and stop positions of the 460 arrays,
we obtained the positions of next CoDing Sequences (CDS) from their
annotation ﬁles (NCBI Genbank format, gbk). All CDSs overlapping
any CRISPR arrays were omitted (99 CDS). The closest CDS coordinate
on the 5’ end of the array and the closest CDS coordinate on the 3’ end of
the array were analyzed. The end with the longest distance was designated
as forward.

sion parameters and scores are in parentheses. A ﬂow diagram of the

of (Total_Forward_score — Total_Reverse_score). Predictions are made

also>0.5; ‘medium’: CS <66% 333% SAS and ‘low’: <33% SAS. The
required conﬁdence score of >0.5 for ‘High’ conﬁdence is required to
exclude results solely from less accurate prediction methods, where the
more accurate methods did not produce a prediction (NP).

2.3 Availability

An implementation in Perl with documentation and test data is available
at http://bioanalysis.otago.ac.nz/CRISPRDirection. This will take as
input a fasta or Genbank formatted, annotated or unannotated genomic
sequences, or simply repeat sequences in fasta format. The algorithm is
shown in Supplement S4, and output is shown in T5.

3 RESULTS

We aimed to develop an algorithm to detect the direction of
CRISPR transcription. This would, as much as possible, be in-
dependent of speciﬁc biological knowledge for known types of
arrays, as often this is neither known nor predicted. Such a
method could be applied within a pipeline to new instances
and potentially new classes of arrays. The predictive methods
adopted were (i) searching for ATTGAAA-like sequence
motifs in the repeats, (ii) finding biased nucleotide composition
(relative AT richness) in the leader and trailer regions of the
arrays, (iii) analysis of mutation(s) in the repeats (array degen-
eracy), (iv) analysis of RNA secondary structure in the repeats,
(v) ﬁnding the longer distance to the next coding gene at the 5’
and 3’ ends and (vi) greater number A compared with T in the
repeat. These methods are depicted in Figure 1.

A reference set of known direction was assembled by using a
set of 26 repeats of experimentally determined orientation in 135
unique arrays. This was extend to 460 repeats by allowing up to
three mismatches (see Section 2.1).

3.1 Speciﬁc sequences at the 3’ end of the repeat

A recent analysis of repeats noted that about a third of their set
of repeats end in ATTGAAA(C/G), and they used that to pre-
dict repeat direction (Lange et al., 2013). To investigate whether
this was a useful predictor on our independently created refer-
ence set, we searched for variants of ATTGAAA(N) at the 3’ end
on both strands. An exact match was found in 30% (137) of the
460 reference arrays. In all these cases, this correctly predicted
the direction of the array (PPV = 1.00, Table 1). Similar one-base
variants of all the bases except the G slightly increased the
number of predictions but retained PPVs of 1.00 (Table 1).
Extensive substitution at the 5’ end, e.g. WWWGAAA(N), still
retained a high PPV (0.96, Table 1). For those 137 arrays that
had ATTGAAA(N), we used this as a certain predictor of the
direction of these arrays. This parameter was given a score of
0.50 (PPV of 1.004150 random chance).

3.2 Biased AT composition in the 5’ and 3’ ﬂanks

The promoter/leader sequence 5’ of the CRISPR array would be
expected to differ from the terminator sequence following it.
These promoters have been described as being AT rich in several
studies, and some AT-rich sequences (e.g. TATAAT-like sigma
70 promoter —10 elements) have been shown to be functional in
CRISPR promoters (Lillestol et al., 2009; Pul et al., 2010). The
AT% was calculated in windows at the two ﬂanks and the per-
cent difference compared. An AT% difference of 0.&l4% and
windows up to 165 bp long were compared (see Section 2.2.2).
The analysis was repeated 100 times for new randomly selected
sets of 100 CRISPR arrays in each run, and the results were
compared to determine the window length and minimum per-
centage difference in the AT that gave an optimal PPV
(Supplementary Fig. S1). This sampling approach was used to
calculate measures of variability within our set of 460 repeats,
which is a sample of all possible CRISPR arrays.

As shown in Figure 2, a window size of 60 with a minimum
AT% difference of 10% gave a high PPV (0.82) with a tolerable
NP (TP 39, FP 9 and NP 53). Higher PPVs could be achieved,
e.g. window size of 105, AT% difference >14%, PPV 0.95
(Supplementary Fig. S1). However, this combination could
only be applied to one-third of the data. As this method is one
of a combination to predict the probable direction, we used a
window size of 60, >10% AT% as a balanced default for
CRISPRDirection. Alternative combinations can be applied in
the implementation, and results are shown in Supplementary
Figure S1.

3.3 Degeneracy at the 3’ end of the array

Based on the idea that repeat sequences at the 3’ end may have
accumulated mutations, we looked for differences at either end
of the predicted arrays. Figure 3A shows that a PPV of >090
could be achieved (TP 89, FP 9 and NP 2). Some of the FPs may
be caused by a random mutation or rare sequencing errors within
the arrays. A higher accuracy (PPV 0.95) can be achieved by only
including arrays with a minimum of two or three mutations
(Fig. 3A). However, as that increases the number of NP
(to ~40%) we did not set any minimum mutation requirement

by default. For 296 valid arrays (2.2.3) this method had 263 TPs,
28 FPs and 5 NPs.

3.4 Potential for RNA secondary structure in the repeat

Some CRISPR repeats are known to form small RNA secondary
structures, which would be strand-speciﬁc. We used a simple
method to test for the greater ability to form thermodynamically
stable secondary structures on each strand. This method was
designed to avoid requiring prior knowledge of classes or struc-
tures in different classes when predicting the direction.

The hypothesis was that theMFE of the forward strand would
be lower compared with the MFE of the other strand. In an
initial analysis, we observed that calculating the MFE of the
whole repeats gives a poor prediction accuracy (Fig. 3B, PPV
0.55). The RNA secondary structural elements, where experi-
mentally characterized, are typically present toward the center
of the repeats rather than at the ends (Lange et al., 2013).
Therefore, we progressively masked the leading bases from the
both ends of the repeats and calculated the MFE (Fig. 3B).

The accuracy of the prediction increased as the ends were
masked by up to five bases (Fig. 3B and PPV 0.87). Further
base neutralization showed that although the PPV was increased,
the number of true predictions rapidly reduced (e.g. PPV 0.90
and NP 26% at 8). The average repeat length is 31 nucleotides,
removing up to ﬁve bases from both sides (total 10 bases) still
kept the secondary structural elements intact in the middle for
most cases and gave a more accurate prediction. However, as
more bases were masked, only longer repeats gave useful results,
indicated by the rapid drop off after eight bases in Figure 3B.

3.5 Analysis of A relative to T in repeats—A/T
ratio analysis

Several studies have also used A/T ratios in the repeat as a pre-
dictor of direction, as it has been observed that archaeal repeats
are A rich (Chan et al., 2012; Lange et al., 2013). The notion is
the forward strand will have more A than T. The PPV for this
was 0.72 (68 TP, 27 FP, 5 NP of samples of 100). During this
analysis, we observed that AT-rich repeats had a higher rate of

which can be applied to improve the overall prediction, we sepa-
rated the repeats into two groups. The first group contains the
AT-rich repeats (i.e. AT%>GC%) and the second group con-
tains AT-poor repeats and reapplied the method. The result
(Fig. 3C) shows that this method is better applied to repeats
that are AT poor (PPV 0.87).

3.6 Distance to the next coding gene at the 5’ and 3’ end
length of leader analysis

The ‘leader’ region containing the promoter may be longer than

the ‘trailing’ region containing the transcription terminator

(Fig. 1). To test if this could be used to predict the direction,

the positions of the nextCDS at the 5’ and 3’ end were obtained

from their corresponding Genbank annotation. Only this

method, of the prediction methods implemented, relies on other
types of gene annotation. The distances were compared to obtain
a parameter that could be tested for use in prediction. As yet the
NCBI Reference sequences do not include CRISPR predictions
and leave them as long intergenic gaps. Hence, CDS annotations
may not be accurate in these regions, and it is possible to have
undetected CDS close to the CRISPR arrays, or falsely predicted
CDS close or within the arrays. Indeed, 99 predicted probable
arrays showed overlapping predicted CDS. These overlapping
CDS were ignored for this analysis.

Distances ranged from 2 to 5252 bases to the next CDS for the
set. However, often both distances were short (<75), making
prediction unreliable. Hence, instead of only testing for the
longer sequence, we also compared if the longer sequence was
at least 120, 140, 160, 180 or >200% the size of the shorter, and
required that at least one of the lengths be >75 nucleotides
(Supplementary Fig. S4). NP was made if the ratio did not
meet the criteria or the length was too short (Fig. 4). These pre-
dictions can be found in the Supplementary spreadsheet
(Supplementary File S2). The maximum PPV obtained was
0.68 (>200%, Fig. 4), this was selected to be used by default.
However, about half the arrays did not have such long leaders
and resulted in NP calls (Fig. 4).

3.7 Combined prediction

Each of the six predictors was combined. To weight more accur-
ate predictions higher (i.e. assigning higher scores to more accur-
ate methods), each of the six predictions was weighted according
to PPV (Section 2.2.8). Thus, the highest weighted prediction was
ATTGAAA(N) (0.5) followed by degeneracy (0.41) and the
lowest weighted prediction was longer leader (0.18). The com-
bined method correctly predicted 424 arrays of the 460 CRISPRs
used as reference with a PPV of 0.94, FP 27 and NP 4 (Bacteria:
PPV 0.92, TP 317, FP 19, NP 4; Archaea: PPV 0.93, TP 112, FP
8, NP 0).

To further assess the robustness of the method, the algorithm
was run without each of the methods in turn and without com-
binations of related methods. Leaving out the most accurate
predictor (ATTGAAA(N) Table 1) had a small effect reducing

Data are the mean and standard deviation of 100 random samples. PPV
values are poor (near random) when the lengths are similar (~1). The
highest PPV (0.68) is obtained when the ratio is >200%

the PPV by ~4% (Supplementary Table S4 and Supplementary
Fig. S2). Leaving out the degeneracy had the greatest single
impact on PPV, reducing it to 0.91. Leaving out the longer
leader method, the only measure that depends on CDS annota-
tion reduced had little effect. If only repeat sequences were used
as input, an option in the implementation, PPV was 0.87 using
three methods (i.e. Motif search, A/T ratio and RNA structure
analysis) that only require the repeat.

An alternative prediction strategy was to predict using the
highest practical PPV from each method (window size 120 and
minimum AT% difference 14 in relative AT-richness analysis, 8
masked bases in the RNA secondary structure analysis and by
requiring two or more mutation in the array degeneracy ana-
lysis). Using this alternative set of options stated as ‘high preci-
sion parameters’ in the section 2.2.7, we obtained a PPV of 0.95
against the whole reference set, with 413 TP, 21 FP and 26 NP
(bacteria: PPV 0.95, NP 26; archaea: PPV 0.97, NP 4,
Supplementary File S2).

Predictions differ in total scores; therefore, a prediction conﬁ-
dence could be determined. Predictions are ﬂagged with ‘high’
confidence if they met deﬁned criteria (Section 2.2.8 and
Supplementary Fig. S4). Final predictions, and conﬁdence
scores, for the direction for the full dataset of 3571 arrays are
available in the Supplementary Material on the companion Web
site.

4 DISCUSSION

The algorithm described works surprisingly well using a set of
relatively easily calculable parameters. At the default level of
accuracy, it correctly predicts 94% of reference arrays. Higher
levels of accuracy (e.g. PPV 0.95 and NP 26) are possible by
changing some of the parameters. This method can be built
into a generic prokaryotic prediction pipeline, without a require-
ment of knowledge whether the sequence is from bacteria or
archaea and without the need to deﬁne the type, subtype, class
or superclass of the array or repeat. However, it is also possible
for users analyzing speciﬁc genomes to incorporate biological
knowledge, e.g. speciﬁc motifs or presence of RNA structure
into the prediction.

4.1 Reference set

The method was tested on a set of 460 arrays, and these consisted
of 208 arrays having exact matches to a set of 26 experimentally
verified repeats from all 10 subtypes. This set was extended by
allowing a small number of mismatches (up to 3 in repeats of
mean length 31). Within genera and classes of arrays, there is
often a large amount of substitution in arrays (Kunin et al.,
2007). Including this small tolerance might include some non-
functional arrays, but is unlikely to reverse the arrays. We com-
pared our array sets with the repeat sets used by Lange et al.
(2013). Our set had members in 7 of the 10 largest structural
classes and 9 of 10 largest sequence classes described
(Supplementary Fig. S3 and Supplementary Tables S7 and S9)
(Lange et al., 2013). This set provides a new independent refer-
ence set for CRISPR analysis.

The similarity to known repeats could be extended to provide
a predictive measure; however, its validation would require a

different reference set. We generated another reference set by
using the 528 arrays that have ATTGAAA(N) at the 3’ end,
and of these, 140 had <4 mismatches to the 26 known repeats
(Supplementary Table S3). All 140 were correctly orientated. Up
to 7 mismatches provided a PPV of 1.0 (250 arrays), and 43% of
all the arrays had this amount of similarity (Supplement T3).
This alternative approach is also implemented in
CRISPRDirection. The use of this motif as a predictor (or any
user-deﬁned motif) can be included optionally in the
CRISPRDirection program. The score can also be changed,
e. g. increased to 4.5, to override the other predictions.

In both the previous sets, there are clearly some sequences with
incorrect orientation, based on subsequent experimentally veri-
ﬁed repeats (Kunin et al., 2007 and Lange et al., 2013). For
example, the type I-F systems have a structured repeat that com-
monly ends in CUAAGAAA (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table
S7) (Haurwitz et al., 2010; Mojica et al., 2009; Przybilski et al.,
2011; Richter et al., 2012b; Sternberg et al., 2012). These are
represented in the classiﬁcation of Kunin et al. (2007) as
CRISPR-4. They comprise classes, M4 and F5, and incorrectly,
its reverse complement, M6 and F8, in the classiﬁcation of Lange
et al. (2013). The work described here will allow further merging
and reﬁnement of these repeat classes, after prior prediction of
the repeat direction.

4.2 Speciﬁc methods

We used one speciﬁc motif set in this analysis (AUUGAAA-
like), as it was present in one-third of arrays. Cleavage immedi-
ately before this sequence generates the 5’ handle on the chNA
in several systems (Nickel et al., 2013; Scholz et al., 2013).
Variations on this also provided strong predictors, as long as
the G was retained (Table 1). These or other variants could
also be used as predictors, particularly if the type was known.
For example, to predict type I-Fiassociated CRISPRs, a variant
of this in which there is reordering of the leading AU right region
may be used (U UAGAAA) (Fig. 5). We searched for motifs at
the end of the sequence but also allowed an additional base to be
present in the repeat prediction. Current CRISPR array predic-
tion algorithms cannot always accurately predict the termini of

Classes F5 and the reverse complement of F8 (Lange et al., 2013) were
merged to form one class, the orientation was determined experimentally
from Przybilski, et al. (2011) and correctly predicted by
CRISPRDirection. There are 109 sequences of this class in our reference
dataset. The true length is 28 bases (3730 on diagram). Extra base(s) at
the left (numbered 172) and right (31) ends of some predicted repeats (6,
or 22 of 223); in addition, some predictions are shorter. These are due to
mispredictions of the ends of the repeats. The full alignment is in supple-
mentary File S1 (T7)

repeats, e.g. if the ﬁrst base of the following spacer is also re-
peated (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table S7).

Other sequence motifs can be deﬁned by users in the repeats.
For example, the presence of motif ‘GUU’ in the ﬁrst bases of
the repeats improved accuracy, and TATAAT-like sequences
function in some repeats (Zhang et al., 2013). However, as
some CRISPRs (e.g. I-E) do not obey these rules, and because
our aim was to make the analysis unbiased to speciﬁc properties,
we did not use more complex motif analysis by default here.

The relative AT% on either side of the repeat provided a
useful predictor for 177 of the 460 arrays (Fig. 6). This is likely
to represent the presence of AT-rich promoter sequences (e.g.
TATAAT) and GC-rich structured terminator sequences. In
addition, the leader region is important for acquisition of new
spacers, which may require AT-rich binding sequences (Diezi
Villasenor et al., 2013; Yosef et al., 2012). The automated deter-
mination of the direction of arrays will enable further computa-
tional analysis of these regulatory regions (Pul et al., 2010). The
relative AT% could also possibly represent adjacent trachNA
(Type II) or cas genes (Zhang et al., 2013).

For 197 of the reference arrays, the presence of a greater
number of mutations at the 3’ trailer end provided a specific
predictor (Fig. 3A). We believe this reﬂects the degeneration of
older repeats at the trailer end. Therefore, CRISPRDirection will
facilitate studies of the evolution of these arrays (Gudbergsdottir
et al., 2011; He and Deem, 2010; Weinberger et al., 2012).

Calculation of a likelihood of forming an RNA structure
worked poorly as a predictor on full-length repeats (Fig. 3B).
This was surprising, as some types have structures (I, II) and
these are well represented in our reference set. However, these
structures are commonly small and located near the center of the
repeat, with the termini involved in other processes (see above).
Exclusion of the ﬁve bases at each end (e.g. UGAAA in more
than one-third of the sequences) improved the PPV (Fig. 3B).

The relative number of A compared with T in repeats has
previously been used to predict CRISPR direction. In particular,
this is used as a predictor of the directions of arrays in the UCSC
Archaeal Genome Browser (Chan et al., 2012). This gave a PPV
of 0.72 overall, but was most effective (0.87) when applied to
repeats with <50% AT (Fig. 3C).

We examined the distance to the next annotated CDS as a
predictor (Fig. 4). This was not an effective predictor unless
the sequences were relatively long. This is the only measure
used here that depends on prior annotation of the genome,
and its exclusion (Supplementary Fig. S2) only reduced precision
by 1%. Therefore, when CRISPRDirection is used as part of a
pipeline it could be run before CDS prediction. This order would
have the advantage of avoiding the many likely spurious CDS
predictions within CRISPR arrays (e.g. 99 of 460 arrays in the
RefSeq annotation). CRISPRDirection could be built into such
pipelines, such as that used by the J GI-DOE (Mavromatis et al.,
2009). A disadvantage of CRISPR prediction before CDS pre-
diction is that repeats in some proteins may be falsely predicted
as arrays by CRISPR prediction algorithms.

The combined analysis is robust to the removal of any of the
predictors or combinations of predictors (Supplementary Fig.
S2). Normally a prediction is made that depends on several
methods. This conﬁdence score normally ranges from 2.6
(where all parameters when added are concordant, Section
2.2.8) to 0.04 (when predictors are discordant or most are NP).
For each prediction, the conﬁdence score can be used to classify
the prediction as high, medium or low conﬁdence (Section 2.2.8).
The 32 arrays, mainly bacterial, for which a false prediction was
made had no obvious similarity in terms of species origin, repeat
sequence or likely class (Supplementary Table S6). However, 30
of the 32 false predictions were classiﬁed as low conﬁdence.

In the future, CRISPRDirection could be built into a more
sophisticated CRISPR array finding algorithm. This could in-
clude additional automatically calculable parameters, or user
inputted parameters. We observed that specific sequences are
common near the ends of the repeats, such as GAA 3’, GTT
5’, and speciﬁc sequences are also found in the leader/promoter
region. These could likely be used to reﬁne the prediction algo-
rithm, particularly in those cases where the direction is unable to
be called with confidence. This could also be provided in a later
interactive CRISPR prediction interface where expert users could
input relevant predictors, or balance the parameters for their
own species.

Abstract

Summary: Cytochrome P450 (CYPs) are the major enzymes involved in drug metabolism and bio—
activation. Inhibition models were constructed for five of the most popular enzymes from the CYP
superfamily in human liver. The five enzymes chosen for this study, namely CYP1A2, CYP2D6,
CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, account for 90% 0f the xenobiotic and drug metabolism in human
body. CYP enzymes can be inhibited or induced by various drugs or chemical compounds. In this
work, a rule—based CYP inhibition prediction online server, Cpru/es, was created based on predict—
ive models generated by the rule—based C5.0 algorithm. Cpru/es can predict and provide struc—
tural rulesets for CYP inhibition for each compound uploaded to the server. Capable of fast execu—
tion performance, it can be used for virtual high—throughput screening (VHTS) of a large set of
testing compounds.

Availability and implementation: Cpru/es is freely accessible at http://cyprules.cmdm.tw/ and
models, descriptor and program files for all compounds are publically available at http://cyprules.

1 Introduction

Among CYP enzymes, CYPlAZ, (IYP2C9, (IYP2Cl9, (IYP2D6 and
CYP3A4 are responsible for 90% of drug oxidation or hydrolysis
(Lynch and Price, 2007). More than 900 drugs have been identified
in causing liver injury (Friedman et (11., 2003), making this the most
common reason for a drug to be withdrawn from the market.
Hepatotoxicity and drug-induced liver injury account for a substan-
tial number of compounds failure, highlighting the need for drug
screening assays capable of detecting potential compound toxicity
early in the drug development processes. Previous CYP prediction
models or prediction servers were: either based on a small number
of compounds, screened with non-rule based approaches that could

not suggest structural rules directly contributing to specific P450, or
only gives yes/no classification results (Cheng et (11., 2011;
Hammann et (11., 2009; Mishra et (11., 2010; Rostkowski et (11.,
2013; Rydberg et (11., 2010; Sun et (11., 2011; Sushko et (11., 2011). In
this study, we chose five of the most common P450 enzymes to build
their corresponding inhibition prediction models with >16 000
compounds. The goals are: (i) to first build statistically high per-
formance 2D and 3D QSAR models, utilizing rule-based C5.0 algo-
rithm (Quinlan, 1993) as a prediction tool to provide structural
information that contribute towards P450 inhibition endpoints in a
faster and more direct manner, compared with other machine learn-
ing methods, (ii) and then provide a simple, easy to use, and freely

ABSTRACT

Summary: Differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) is a rapid
technique that can be used in structural biology to study protein—
ligand interactions. We have developed DMAN, a novel tool to
analyse multi-well plate data obtained in DSF experiments. DMAN is
easy to install and provides a user-friendly interface. Multi-well plate
layouts can be designed by the user and experimental data can be
annotated and analysed by DMAN according to the specified plate
layout. Statistical tests for significance are performed automatically,
and graphical tools are also provided to assist in data analysis. The
modular concept of this software will allow easy development of
other multi-well plate analysis applications in the future.

Availability and implementation: DMAN is implemented in Java
to provide a cross-platform compatibility. It is freely available
to academic users at http://www.structuralchemistry.org/pcsb/. To
download DMAN, users will be asked for their name, institution and
email address. A manual can also be downloaded from this site.

1 INTRODUCTION

Assays in multi-well plate formats have become very popular and
are frequently employed in laboratories in different disciplines of the
life sciences. Due to their wide applicability, UV/Vis absorbance and
ﬂuorescence emission measurements are the most common readouts
in such assays.

In the area of structural biology, differential scanning ﬂuorimetry
(DSF) has established itself as a tool to assess protein stability in
the context of structure—function studies, but most importantly to
rapidly identify low molecular weight ligands that bind to the protein
of interest (Lo et al., 2004; Niesen et al., 2007; Pantoliano et al.,
2001; Poklar et al., 1997). Due to the relatively low amounts of
sample required, and the parallel measurement of many conditions
on one multi-well plate, DSF also lends itself as a ﬁrst-line screening
method for potential small molecule ligands in structure-based drug
discovery, including fragment-based drug design.

DSF experiments are typically conducted with a real-time
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) instrument, where the protein
sample is mixed with an additive to be screened and the ﬂuorescence

dye SYPRO Orange that shows enhanced ﬂuorescence emission in
hydrophobic environment (Vedadi et al., 2006). The dye binds to the
exposed hydrophobic residues of proteins in their unfolded states,
and thus serves as a reporter to monitor thermally induced protein
unfolding.

Analysis software for any instrument-acquired data is provided
by the manufacturers and shows varying degrees of convenience
and user-friendliness. In case of DSF, analysis of data from some
instruments requires subsequent application of several different
software programs, therefore making the entire process rather
cumbersome.

We set out to design a simple-to-use and portable Java
application, DMAN, which enables analysis of DSF data on
multi-well plates with any user-Chosen layout of replica. Typically,
biochemical measurements are done in triplicate. In order to prevent
instrument-biased systematic errors due to non-uniform temperature
distribution across the PCR block, we prefer to measure replica
data on one plate, with the individual replica mixtures spread over
the plate. The Java application reported here can analyse these
repetitions, given the particular plate layout, and perform standard
statistical tests.

2 METHODS

DMAN is a Java application that builds on and extends fundamental
Java classes developed within the programme collection for structural
biology and biophysical chemistry (PCSB) (Hofmann and Wlodawer. 2002).
We have also implemented a method to perform Welch’s modiﬁcation
of Student’s t-test (Welch. 1947). Typically. individual protein thermal
unfolding curves adopt a sigmoid shape as a function of temperature. The
melting temperature Tm is then determined by ﬁnding the temperature that
corresponds to the maximum of the ﬁrst derivative of the melting curve
around the estimated point of inﬂection.

3 RESULTS

The graphical user interface of the stand-alone Java application
DMAN possesses four tabbed panels (Input parameters, Raw data,
Results, Plate). On the ﬁrst panel, Input parameters, the user needs
to specify the data ﬁle and its origin (i.e. instrument type), the plate
layout (provided as an ASCII text ﬁle), the output ﬁle, a title and
description of the assay, the temperature range of the experiment and
the slope threshold. The user can also specify the AT,” threshold
and the Outlier cutoﬁ’, which are used during analysis to evaluate the

signiﬁcance of the results. The raw data ﬁle is parsed and analysed
by clicking the Read Data button.

3.1 Data processing

After the data have been parsed, the Raw data panel becomes active
and displays a table of the extracted melt curve parameters per well
(Tm, slope, signal at Tm”, lowest signal and highest signal). This
information is visualized in the Plate panel, where the individual
values for Tm and slope are mapped onto a representation of the
actual plate (Fig. 1A). The boxes are labelled and coloured to help
identify the replica. A checkbox labelled I allows the user to include
or exclude a particular well into the subsequent analysis; a well is
automatically excluded if the slope of the curve around the point
of inﬂection is less than the speciﬁed slope threshold. A checkbox
labelled G opens a new window that shows the melt curves for the
current well and its replica on the plate.

For each dataset, a z-test is performed, and individual wells that
show a Tm value differing by more than Outlier cutoﬁ’ >< estimated
SD are automatically excluded from the analysis. The user can revise
these suggestions by a simple mouse click.

3.2 Data analysis

As shown in Figure 1B, the Results panel lists the analysis results
for each set of replica (dataset). The user can also review the melt

curves for each dataset from this panel. The average Tm values
and the SD as well as ATm as compared to the reference dataset
(annotated with the symbol ’R’) are calculated and shown. If AT,"
is larger than the user-speciﬁed threshold, the dataset is labelled
with a ‘*’. If the signiﬁcance level from a t-test is better than 0.05, a
second ‘*’ is added to that dataset. An embedded bar chart provides
a convenient means for visualizing signiﬁcant datasets.

3.3 Plate layout

The type of plate used, as well as the location of datasets on the
multi-well plate, along with comments for each dataset is coded in
an ASCII ﬁle that can by read by DMAN. This ﬁle can easily be
written or modiﬁed by the user with a text editor to implement any
plate layout. Alternatively, the plate layout can be designed with
the graphical user interface accessible from the Edit menu. In this
case, replica wells labelled with the same number or character are
recognized as one dataset; the location of the reference dataset can
also be deﬁned.

A description for each dataset can also be entered, either as part of
the plate layout design, or only for the plate currently being analysed.

3.4 Future development

Currently, we have implemented parsers for data obtained with
Roche LC480 real-time PCR instrument. Development of additional
raw data parsers for other real-time PCR instruments are planned.
Feedback from potential users in that context is highly welcome.

The modular design of DMAN will also enable easy development
of further multi-well plate analysis applications, such as UV/Vis
absorbance and ﬂuorescence emission measurements.

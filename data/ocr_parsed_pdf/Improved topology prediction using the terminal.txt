Abstract

Motivation: The translocon recognizes sufficiently hydrophobic regions of a protein and inserts
them into the membrane. Computational methods try to determine what hydrophobic regions are
recognized by the translocon. Although these predictions are quite accurate, many methods still
fail to distinguish marginally hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) helices and equally hydrophobic
regions in soluble protein domains. In vivo, this problem is most likely avoided by targeting of the
TM—proteins, so that non—TM proteins never see the translocon. Proteins are targeted to the translo—
con by an N—terminal signal peptide. The targeting is also aided by the fact that the N—terminal helix
is more hydrophobic than other TM—helices. In addition, we also recently found that the C—terminal
helix is more hydrophobic than central helices. This information has not been used in earlier top—
ology predictors.

Results: Here, we use the fact that the N— and C—terminal helices are more hydrophobic to develop
a new version of the first—principle—based topology predictor, SCAMPI. The new predictor has two
main advantages; first, it can be used to efficiently separate membrane and non—membrane pro—
teins directly without the use of an extra prefilter, and second it shows improved performance for
predicting the topology of membrane proteins that contain large non—membrane domains.

1 Introduction

 

The biogenesis of most x-helical transmembrane (TM) proteins follows
a path where the synthesis is halted after a signal peptide is recognized
by a signal recognition particle (Rapoport et (11., 2004). After the recog-
nition, the ribosome is transported to the ER-, organelle- or plasma-
membrane, where translation starts again with the emerging peptide
chain threaded through the translocon channel, additional TM helices
being recognized and, in some cases, the signal peptide is cleaved off.
Although it is clear that, for some proteins, additional rearrangements
occur (Kauko et (11., 2010), most membrane proteins appear to follow
a folding procedure where the recognized TM helices come together to

pack optimally (Rapoport et (11., 2004). This means that the location
of membrane helices is primarily determined by the recognition of
hydrophobic segments by the translocon.

The positive-inside rule (von Heijne and Gavel, 1988) governs
the overall orientation of a protein, so that there is a global pattern
of positively charged amino acids in the loops that occur on the peri-
plasmic side of the membrane. The exact way in which the positive-
inside rule acts is unclear, but even the presence or lack of positively
charged residues close to the C-terminal can shift the orientation of
the protein entirely (Seppala et (11., 2010). Ultimately, the combin-
ation of hydrophobic segments recognized by the translocon and the

helix. It therefore seems as if the positive—inside rule is stronger when a
following TM helix is present. Since no TM—helix follows the most C—
terminal helix, the insertion of it cannot be aided by the positive—inside
rule, i.e. it needs to be sufficiently hydrophobic to be inserted by itself
(Virkki et al., 2014).

To the best of the authors” knowledge, all topology predictors
treat all TM—helices equally and do therefore ignore the fact that the
N— and C—terminal TM—helices should be more hydrophobic. Here,
we present a new version of SCAMPI that improves predictions by
utilizing this observation.

2 Methods

In the original SCAMPI method, only two parameters, namely pKR
and AGShift, are optimized, see Figure 2. pKR stands for the positive—in—
side bias, which is the ratio of positively charged residues between the
inside and the outside of the membrane. AGShift is a hydrophobicity
parameter used for the identification of TM helices. The topology is
produced by finding the optimal path through an HMM with AGShiﬁ
and pm as the only optimizable parameters. However, for large—scale
use, a strict prefilter based on the AC of the most hydrophobic region
was employed in order to separate TM and non—TM proteins. In
Table 1, it can be seen that both AGShift and the prefilter cut—off are
higher than 0, i.e. even helices that, experimentally, have <50%
chance to be inserted into the membrane, have a good chance to pass
the filter. The optimal AGShift is actually close to the value that is best
at separating TM and non—TM regions.

In the new version of SCAMPI, we introduce two additional par—
ameters, AGN and AGC. These are the hydrophobicity parameters for
the N— and C—terminal helices. For SCAMPI2, all four parameters were

optimized based on a 3—fold cross—validation, using a grid—search (see
Supplementary information for details). If several sets of parameters
provide identical performance, they are all used. Therefore, there is an
upper and lower limit in some of the numbers in Table 2. Similar to the
original SCAMPI version, there are two ﬂavors of SCAMPI2, one that
uses single sequence and one that uses multiple sequence alignments
(MSA). In the later case, the MSA is obtained using PSI—BLAST
(Altschul et al., 1997) with Uniref90 (Suzek et al., 2015) as reference
database. The MSA version is identical to the single sequence version
but uses the average AG for all the sequences in the MSA, see
Supplementary information.

TM proteins were extracted from the PDBTM database (Kozma
et al., 2013) and mapped to the respective Uniprot (UniProt
Consortium, 2014) sequences using the SIFTS database (Velankar
et al., 2013). In contrast to some earlier studies, the full—length
Uniprot sequences are used and not only the structurally determined
regions. We assumed that no additional TM regions were present. A
correct predicted topology requires that (i) the number of TM re—
gions is correctly predicted, (ii) the location of each predicted helix
overlaps with at least five residues with the observed helix and (iii)
the N— and C—termini are located to be at the correct side of the
membrane.

For topology assignment, we used PDBTM, OPM (Lomize et al.,
2006), TOPDB (Dobson et al., 2014) and Uniprot annotations.
After performing a 20% sequence identity homology reduction,
285 TM—proteins remained. Of them, 60 proteins contain non—mem—
brane domains longer than 200 residues (denoted as long domains
in Table 2). As a non—TM set 3597 non—TM proteins originating
from SIGNALP4.0 (Petersen et al., 2011) and previously used in
TOPCONS (Tsirigos et al., 2015 ) were used for evaluation. For the

Methods that are marked With an asterisk ( “) include a preﬁlter, methods With dagger (T) also predict signal peptides. The accuracies are measured on the entire
dataset (Overall), only the membrane proteins (TM), only the membrane proteins with long non-TM domains (Long) and the non-TM proteins (non-TM). The re-

sults for SCAMPI2 are cross validated, While the others are not. However, during the cross validation it is possible that in the training set several different param-

eters provide identical results. In such cases, all these parameters were tested and the maximum/minimum results are shown in the table. For TM proteins Without

a signal peptide, a topology is deemed correct when the predicted topology has the same N-terminal, same number of TM helices as the experimentally veriﬁed

one and the helices overlap by at least ﬁve residues. For TM proteins With a signal peptide, a correct topology for SCAMPI (and other methods not designed for

signal peptide prediction) is considered if no TM regions are predicted in the N-terminal part of the protein. The non-TM accuracy is given for the large dataset

containing 3597 non-TM proteins and it requires that neither TM helix nor a signal peptide is predicted in these proteins

For MSA methods, there is a similar picture, with MEMSAT3
showing a better topology predictions of TM proteins, but being
slightly worse at separating TM and non—TM proteins. Finally, the
consensus predictor TOPCONS that combines the predictions from
several methods, including SCAMPI, shows a slightly higher per—
formance than SCAMPI2.

However, SCAMPI2 has some additional advantages over the
other methods; first it is significantly faster than Philius or
MEMSAT3 (in single— or multiple—sequence modes, respectively).
Moreover, the results presented here are cross validated, whereas for
the rest of the methods there is certainly some overlap between our
datasets and their training set.

Finally, we found it interestingly that the method that is best at sep—
arating TM and non—TM proteins is the 15—years—old TMHMM, with
99% accuracy. However, the good separation comes at the price of
non—optimal accurate topology predictions. The accuracy is 56 versus
63% for HMMTOP developed at the same time. This highlights the
importance and problems with recognition of marginally hydrophobic
helices. If they are recognized, the topology predictions are better but
there is a higher chance of false predictions in non—TM proteins.

4 Conclusions

We present a novel topology prediction method, SCAMPI2, that, to
the best of the authors” knowledge, for the first time uses the obser—
vation that the N— and C—terminal helices in a TM—protein are, on
average, more hydrophobic than the other TM—helices. By increasing
the hydrophobicity requirement for the N— and C—terminal helices in
TM proteins, it is possible to improve topology predictions, in par—
ticular for proteins with long non—TM domains. An additional ad—
vantage of this method is that no prefilter to distinguish TM and
non—TM protein is required. Clearly, the difference in hydrophobi—
city of central and terminal helices could also be included in other
methods, demonstrating therefore a possible improvement for all
topology predictors, in particular if the hydrophobicity of signal
peptides is also taken into account.

Abstract

Motivation: Graphical representations of contrasts in GC usage among codon frame positions
(frame analysis) provide evidence of genes missing from the annotations of prokaryotic genomes
of high GC content but the qualitative approach of visual frame analysis prevents its applicability
on a genomic scale.

Results: We developed two quantitative methods for the identification and statistical characterization
in sequence regions of three—base periodicity (hits) associated with open reading frame structures.
The methods were implemented in the N—Profile Analysis Computational Tool (NPACT), which high—
lights in graphical representations inconsistencies between newly identified ORFs and pre—existing
annotations of coding—regions. We applied the NPACT procedures to two recently annotated strains
of the deltaproteobacterium Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans, identifying in both genomes numer—
ous conserved ORFs not included in the published annotation of coding regions.

Availability and implementation: NPACT is available as a web—based service and for download at

1 Introduction

Accurate genome annotations are fundamental to a great variety of
sequence analyses. Annotations of prokaryotic genomes are based
on computational gene prediction methods that, using information
from sequence composition (Delcher et (11., 2007; Hyatt et (11., 2010;
Lukashin and Borodovsky, 1998; Salzberg et (11., 1998) and from se—
quence signals (e.g. ribosome binding site) (Hyatt et (11., 2010;
Larsen and Krogh, 2003), have achieved remarkable levels of sensi—
tivity (>99%). The availability of large databases of gene sequences
also facilitates identification of coding regions using information
from sequence similarity. Nevertheless, a multitude of ORFs con—
served across distantly related genomes and not reported in pub—
lished genome annotations have been recently identified (Warren
et (11., 2010). Despite the high sensitivity of gene prediction methods,

certain genes may still be difficult to predict, for example, genes of
very short length or genes encoded by heterologous DNA. True
genes may also be excluded from the annotation by over—conserva—
tive criteria of robustness of prediction across methods or of evolu—
tionary conservation. For example, although Glimmer3.0 (Delcher
et (11., 2007) is often considered to have lower specificity than other
predictors (e.g. GeneMark HMM or Prodigal), many genes pre—
dicted by Glimmer3.0 and not included in genome annotations have
been confirmed in a recent analysis, based on evolutionary conserva—
tion and functional characterization (Wood et (11., 2012).

standardize the annotation process integrating resources for se—
quence annotation.

Coding regions of high GC content (GC>55—60%) in most
cases can be identified by their three—base periodicity in GC con—
tent, using the method of frame—analysis (Bibb et al., 1984). In
frame analysis, the GC content of three subsequences composed
of every third nucleotide starting from position 1, 2 or 3 of the
original sequence is computed within a moving window and repre—
sented as three ‘S—profiles’ (Brocchieri et al., 2005). Coding re—
gions can then be visually recognized by the typical contrasts that
they induce among profiles (Supplementary Fig. S1). Frame ana—
lysis has been implemented in the FramePlot software (Ishikawa
and Hotta, 1999), a web—based tool for visualization of S—profiles,
positions of stop codons, and potential start of translation codons,
which has often been utilized for the characterization of specific
gene families (e.g. Goranovic et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2011;
Sherwood et al., 2013).

Anecdotal observations in genomes of high GC content (about
one—third of all sequenced genomes) indicate that many genes not
listed in annotations can be identified by visual frame analysis.
Genome—wide frame analysis has been made accessible with the re—
lease of recent versions of FramePlot and through the Artemis gen—
ome browser and annotation tool (Rutherford et al., 2000).
However, its applicability on a genomic scale is still impractical, due
to its qualitative nature. To address these limitations, we developed
procedures for the quantitative assessment and statistical character—
ization of sequence segments with three—base—periodicity (‘quantita—
tive frame analysis’) and for their convenient genome—wide
representation. We implemented these procedures in the newly de—
veloped N—Profile Analysis Computational Tool (NPACT), by which
ORFs with significant periodicities are identified and compared with
pre—existing annotations in graphical representations showing the
positional relations of newly identified ORFs with three—base peri—
odic sequence segments, compositional profiles, and pre—annotated
coding regions. We evaluated the potential of quantitative frame
analysis to identify genes missed from annotations, and analyzed
with NPACT the genome sequences and annotations of two strains
of Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans, a deltaproteobacterium of
interest for a variety of bio—remediation applications (He and
Sanford, 2003; Marshall et al., 2009; Sanford et al., 2007). We iden—
tified in the two genomes several ORFs with compositional period—
icity that were excluded from the published annotations. Upon
further analysis, we found in most cases that their coding capacity
was corroborated by evolutionary conservation, functional charac—
terization and computational gene predictions.

2 Quantitative frame analysis

We implemented quantitative frame analysis in the NPACT applica—
tion. NPACT first identifies sequence segments with statistically sig—
nificant compositional three—base periodicity that are associated
with ‘reading frames’, i.e. with sequences of trinucleotides uninter—
rupted by ‘stop codons’. To extend applicability of frame analysis to
sequences of any composition, we extended the analysis of compos—
itional three—periodicities from GC content to individual nucleo—
tides. Periodicities are identified using two newly developed tests:
the first test identifies three—base periodicities that are expected in
coding sequences (Besemer and Borodovsky, 1999) of a given local
composition; the second test identifies sequence regions with three—
base periodicities of any type. ORFs of minimum length associated
with segments of compositional periodicity are then identified when
present, searching for the start—of—translation codon closest to the 5 ’—

end of the region of periodicity. All ORFs identified by three—base
periodicity are compared by NPACT to a set of predicted genes or
to gene annotations provided by the user, distinguishing three—base
periodicities that support the annotated genes from those that iden—
tify discrepancies and potential genes not included in the provided
set of predictions. NPACT produces graphical representations that
allow genome—wide uninterrupted visual comparison of compos—
itional profiles, pre—annotated genes and sequence segments of
three—base periodicity with ‘Newly Identified ORFs’, enabling frame
analysis on a genomic scale.

2.1 The H—test: high—scoring segments of coding—like
composition

To identify three—base periodicities associated with coding regions,
we considered all ‘reading frames’ of the input sequence, i.e. con—
tinuous sequences of trinucleotides not interrupted by in—frame stop
codons (TAA, TGA or TAG) that may contain coding regions. Each
reading—frame was also used to identify the local composition of the
sequence, based on which the nucleotide composition of the three
codon positions can be predicted. Specifically, the expected fre—
quency E(1rxi) of nucleotide type X (: A, C, G, T) at codon position
i (: 0, 1, 2) can be estimated by linear regression over its overall nu—
cleotide frequency TEX from collections of known genes (Fig. 1A). To
identify within a reading frame sequence segments of any length
with the three—base periodicities expected in coding regions, we
derived an implementation of the ‘high—scoring segment’ approach
(Karlin and Altschul, 1990) based on cumulating, along the se—
quence, scores appropriate for identifying segments with expected
phase—specific nucleotide frequencies, such as log—odds—ratio scores
S(X,-) : ln [E(1rX,)/1rX], assigned to each nucleotide and codon pos—
ition (Fig. 1B).

However, the absence of stop codons from reading frames gener—
ates dependencies between nucleotides in different codon positions
(Supplementary Tables S3 and S4) and affects the probability with
which nucleotides associate to form ‘codons’. To account for these
dependencies, we built instead log—odds—ratio scores for codons,
based on their expected frequencies in ‘pseudo—coding’ and ‘random’
sequences, generated, respectively, drawing nucleotides with ap—
propriate phase—specific probabilities {pxi}, or overall probabilities
{px} and removing stop codons. Given a specific reading frame,
these probabilities can be calculated so that after removing stop
codons, the expected nucleotide frequencies of the randomly gener—
ated sequences are the same as the overall frequencies observed in
the reading frame, and in the pseudo—coding model, as the phase—
specific frequencies expected in a corresponding coding region
(Supplementary Methods). If 179,21, and 17:21, are the probabilities
with which stop codons are generated in the random and pseudo—
coding models, respectively, based on the ratio of expected frequen—
cies, the log—odds—ratio score for codon XYZ is (Fig. 1C):

In pxmvzpz. (1 — 27:33,)

Score(XYZl1r) :
pxpypzﬂ — 2733;.)

(1)

By summing codon scores along a reading—frame sequence, seg—
ments of any length with statistically significant cumulative score
and expected phase—specific nucleotide composition can be identi—
fied, as described in Supplementary Figure S2. We evaluated cumu—
lative—score values at different levels of statistical significance for
23 426 different compositional states, covering nucleotide frequen—
cies from 0.0 to 1.0 at intervals Anx : 0.02, and sequence lengths
doubled from 150 to 9600 nt, each from samples of 10000

randomly generated sequences (Supplementary Methods). We found
that threshold—score values were linearly related to the log—log of the
length of the sequence (Supplementary Fig. S3). Based on this rela—
tion, threshold scores for any length L and compositional state la,
can be obtained from pre—calculated linear—regression coefficients
(abbk) specific to each state la as S >i< (Ll/2) : am In L + bk We refer
to the sequence regions identified by this approach as ‘H—type hits’
or ‘H—hits’, and to the corresponding test as the ‘H—test’.

Because high—scoring segments could be induced by genes
encoded in alternative frames, we also scored each significant H—hit
against all alternative frames substituting in log—odds—ratio scores
the frequencies expected in a random model with those expected in
alternative coding frames. If the frame of a high—scoring segment is
the identity permutation I, and alternative frames are identified by
alternative permutations 73 of codon frame positions, scores relative
to 73 are obtained as:

where 17:31, and 17:5,), are the probabilities of stop codons under the

pseudo—coding model for the corresponding permutations.
Cumulating these scores along a H—hit sequence can result in a new,
potentially shorter high—scoring segment. This is in turn re—scored
relative to other permutations (Supplementary Fig. S2) until all five
alternative permutations are tested. The final highest—scoring seg—
ment is retained only if it is still significant relative to the random
sequence.

2.2 The G—test: significant nucleotide association with
codon positions

To identify within a reading—frame three—base periodicities of any
type, we propose a procedure based on the G statistics (Sokal and
Rohlf, 1994), which is often used as an alternative to the  for test—
ing associations. In our implementation, we used values of the G
statistics (G—values) to score association of nucleotides with codon
positions, as illustrated in Figure 2 and detailed in Supplementary
Methods. Brieﬂy, in a reading frame of L codons, a G—value is calcu—
lated over the interval [i,L] (1 SiSL) and is assigned to codon

values of GM corresponding to two significance levels at are indicated by

position i as its ‘G—score’. The codon position i:m of maximum
G—score identifies a sequence interval [m,L]. Within this interval,
G—values are calculated over intervals [m,/'] and assigned to codon
positions/ (m g j g L). Position / :M (M 2 m) of maximum G—score
GR, identifies with position m the sequence segment [m,M], which is
characterized as ‘high—scoring’ if GM exceeds a threshold score G},
of significant probability. We identified thresholds of significance
for the GM statistics for a large number of compositions and differ—
ent sequence lengths based on large samples of randomly generated
sequences, as described for the H—test. As for the H statistics, we
found that threshold values of GM depend on sequence composition
and are linearly related to the log—log—length of the sequence
(Supplementary Fig. S4) and can similarly be inferred for any se—
quence length and composition. We refer to this test of association
as the ‘G—test’, and to the high—scoring segments identified by the
G—test as ‘G—type hits’ or ‘G—hits’.

Because three—base periodicities identified as G—hits do not pro—
vide information on the reading frame and coding strand of a poten—
tial gene, G—hits were re—scored, as for the H—hits, by H—scores
against coding in alternative frames (see earlier), and retained only if
the G—value of the final high—scoring segment scored significantly by
the G—test.

2.3 Three—base periodicities, low—complexity

and newly identified ORFs

Using the newly developed tests, sequence segments with three—base
periodicity can be identified within all reading frames of the direct
and complementary strand of an input sequence. In our implementa—
tion, we first applied the H—test, and then applied the G—test to re—
gions not covered by H—hits. We then evaluated if three—periodicities
could be associated with regions of low complexity, which could
generate significant cumulative scores if composed of trinucleotides
with positive score. We calculated Shannon entropy H (Shannon,
1948) for each hit, based on its codon frequencies, and normalized it
to the interval [0,1] by expressing it in log(61) units (61 being the

size of the ‘codon alphabet’). We defined repetitive elements as se—
quence segments with H < 0.4, based on the distribution of H among
genes of a large set of characterized coding regions (data not shown).
The association of hits with ORF structures was determined
looking for a potential start of translation codon upstream of the
5’—end of a hit. If no canonical start codon (AUG or GUG) was pre—
sent, alternative (rare) start codons were searched for in the order of
preference UUG, CUG and AUU. ORFs were ranked by the score of
the associated hit, and each hit was also characterized by an E—value,
accounting for multiple testing (Supplementary Methods).

2.4 NPACT and the identification of genes missed from
annotations

We implemented the described procedures in the web—based bio—
informatics tool NPACT. NPACT compares ORFs identified by
three—base periodicity with annotated or predicted coding regions
provided by the user, identifying all ORFs not included in the set of
pre—annotated genes, and characterizing pre—annotated genes as con—
firmed by significant periodicities, non—supported (if no significant
hits are identified in frame within the annotated gene), contradicted
(if hits superimposed to the gene are associated with an ORF in an
alternative frame) or modified (if periodicities suggest a different
start of translation for the gene). Furthermore, NPACT provides a
convenient graphical representation, in which all ORFs identified in
annotated inter—genic regions (INTER) or superimposed to anno—
tated genes (SUPER) not supported by periodicities, are highlighted
in a separate track, and can be visually evaluated in comparison to
profiles of frame—specific nucleotide—usage (frame—analysis), to re—
gions of significant three—base periodicity (‘Hits’) and to the position
of pre—annotated genes. NPACT also generates nucleotide and trans—
lated amino acid sequences for newly identified ORFs, for subse—
quent analyses.

Several features distinguish NPACT representations from other
frame—analysis viewers and from a classical ‘genome—browser’ repre—
sentation: (i) NPACT generates a continuous representation of the
genome sequence and its features in a multi—line format enabling
canvas interactivity under the KonvaJS HTML5 Canvas JavaScript
framework. Compared with a traditional ‘genome—browser’ repre—
sentation, canvas interactivity allows users to seamlessly navigate
through an entire prokaryotic genome in a few seconds, facilitating
discovery and analysis of inconsistencies between annotated genes
and newly identified ORFs. (ii) Besides plotting by default phase—
specific profiles of GC content (S—profiles) as in frame analysis,
NPACT allows users to explore profiles of any alternative nucleo—
tide combination (‘N—profiles’). This feature can be useful for the
analysis of sequences of any GC content. (iii) Visualization of all H—
type and G—type hits provides information on the statistical signifi—
cance, coding—frame support, and boundaries of the contrasts visual—
ized by the compositional profiles, as well as on the presence of
underlying reading—frame structures. (iv) By plotting pre—annotated
genes with hits and profiles, inconsistencies between annotated
genes and sequence periodicities can be visually identified and eval—
uated. (v) Highlighting newly identified ORFs in a separate track
directs focus on three—base periodicities not explained by previously
identified genes and facilitates their visual evaluation in comparison
with hits, compositional profiles, and position relative to predicted
neighboring genes.

Measured on a MacPro Quad 2.4GHz personal desktop com—
puter, genome sequences and annotations are processed and visual—
ized by NPACT at a rate of ~0.2 Mbp/s, practically constant over
sequence lengths up to at least 90 Mbp.

3 Results

3.1 Power of the tests

We assessed the potential of coding regions of different length and
composition to generate significant periodicities over sets of func—
tionally characterized coding sequences (CDS) annotated in 1083
prokaryotic genomes from the NCBI Genome database. A subset of
2 452 743 CDS (here referred to as the ‘Characterized’ set) was cre—
ated excluding all sequences described as hypothetical (from NCBI
"'.ffn files), which formed a second set of 1 094230 ‘Hypothetical’
sequences (Table 1; Supplementary Table S5 for compositional de—
tails). Three—base periodicities were identified at two significance
levels («210’2 and «21073) in both sets (Table 1). Overall, hits of
the H—type or G—type were identified in ~85% of the sequences in
the Characterized set, whereas hits of either type were found
in > 90% of the sequences (84.5% at «21073). In comparison, a sig—
nificantly lower fraction of hits were identified in the Hypothetical
set (72.0% at significant level «21072, and 61.3% at «21073).

Partitioning the Characterized and Hypothetical datasets into
classes of different length and GC—content (Supplementary Table
S5), we found as expected that the frequency of genes with signifi—
cant three—base periodicities increased with sequence length
(Fig. 3A). Compositional periodicities were identified in the vast ma—
jority (>99%) of Characterized genes with length 2600 codons,
and in > 90% of the sequences of length 2 250 codons at the signifi—
cance level «21072. Significant periodicities were still observed in
the majority (60.6%) of the sequences in the length range 50—99
codons and in almost one—third (31.9%) of sequences shorter than
50 codons. Mirroring the overall result, we found a lower frequency
of hits among Hypothetical sequences than among those
Characterized (Fig. 3A), demonstrating that the lower frequency of
periodic ORFs in the Hypothetical set did not depend on the average
shorter length of hypothetical genes (Table 1 ).

The power of the tests was also significantly affected by the GC
content of the sequences (Fig. 3B). Significant hits («2104) were
identified in > 98% of all characterized sequences of high GC con—
tent (GC 2 0.60). Among sequences with a GC content in the range
[0.40—0.45), corresponding to the least intense contrasts in frame—
specific GC content (Supplementary Fig. S1), significant hits were
found in ~79% of the sequences. Consistently with the overall re—
sults, fewer significant hits were identified among hypothetical genes
within each GC—class, particularly among genes of low GC content.
Similar trends were identified for individual tests (Supplementary
Table S6) and using a higher threshold of significance
(Supplementary Table S7). The joint effect of length and GC content
on the power of the combined tests is represented in Figure 3C

for similar relations for individual tests). A higher stringency in sig—
nificance level («21073) affected power mostly among short se—
quences (<100 codons) (Supplementary Fig. S5 and Supplementary
Table S7). These results reﬂected the high power of frame analysis
in its application to GC—rich sequences, for which the sensitivity of
our methods compared to, or even exceeded, that of probabilistic
approaches based on high—order Markov models (Supplementary
Table S8). It also showed that three—base periodicities can provide
useful information on the presence of coding regions also in se—
quences of lower GC content.

3.2 Newly identified ORFs with significant periodicity

We analyzed with NPACT the set of more than 1000 genomes used
for the sets of Characterized and Hypothetical annotated genes. We
identified in INTER regions 167611 ORFs of significant periodicity,
corresponding to an average of 44.6 ORFs/Mbp (Supplementary
Table S9). Despite differences in power of the tests, inter—genic ORFs
with three—base periodicity were identified in sequences of all GC con—
tents, with frequencies ranging from 33 ORFs/Mbp in replicons of
40—45% GC content, to 60 ORFs/Mbp in those of 55—60% GC con—
tent (Supplementary Table S9). To seek further support to the coding
potential of these ORFs, we evaluated their evolutionary conservation
in sequence and in length (Supplementary Material), and we

Prodigal (Hyatt et al., 2010), Glimmer3.0 (Delcher et al., 2007),
GeneMarkHMM (Lukashin and Borodovsky, 1998) and
GeneMark2.5 (Borodovsky and McIninch, 1993), available at the
NCBI bacterial—genome website. About one—quarter of all newly iden—
tified ORFs were conserved across genera or phyla (Table 2), with no
clear trend across classes of GC content (Supplementary Table S9).
Surprisingly, we also found that almost half of all ‘inter—genic’ ORFs
were predicted by one or more of the gene predictors we tested,
among which were ~90% of the conserved ORFs (Table 2 and
Supplementary Table S9). A significant finding was that the majority
of the ORFs predicted by at least one method were in fact predicted
by all, and more than two—thirds by at least three methods
(Supplementary Table S10), indicating that the exclusion of these
ORFs from the annotations did not depend on limitations in the ear—
lier gene predictors GeneMark2.5 and GeneMarkHMM.
Furthermore, conserved and predicted ORFs were relatively long
(693 nt on average, Supplementary Table S11), indicating that size
was not a factor in their exclusion.

We also identified, across replicons of any GC content, 157 182
ORFs (41.8 ORFs/Mbp) in SUPER regions (Supplementary Table
S12). In contrast to inter—genic ORFs, the coding potential of > 90%
of these ORFs was neither supported by conservation nor by any
gene predictor (Supplementary Table S12). In combination with
their shorter length (160 nt on average, Supplementary Table S13),
lack of conservation and lack of support from gene predictors sug—
gest that the ‘gene—like’ periodicity of these ORFs was more likely
induced by compositional ﬂuctuations in the superimposed gene.
Nevertheless, also among superimposed ORFs we identified 7424
longer ORFs (398 nt long on average) that were evolutionarily con—
served in sequence and in length. Of these conserved ORFs, ~25 %
were also identified by some or by all prediction methods
(Supplementary Tables S12 and S14).

3.3 The coding potential of Anaeromyxobacter
dehalogenans

We analyzed the GC—rich (~74.8% GC content) genomes of strains
2CP—1 (Accession Number NC_011891) and 2CP—C (NC_007760)
of the deltaproteobacterium Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans using
the NPACT tool as part of an annotation pipeline, by comparing
collections of genes resulting from previous annotation efforts to
ORFs with significant three—base periodicity. Selected examples of

CDS is coding regions annotated with RefSeq genome. ORFs are identiﬁed
by regions of three-base periodicity. Conﬁrmed and Contradicted is in refer—
ence to identiﬁed regions of three—base periodicity. Inter—genie or
Superimposed is in reference to annotated CDS.

newly identified ORFs as visualized by NPACT are shown for strain
2CP—C in Supplementary Figure S6. Complete graphical results (sig—
nificance level 0.01) for both strains are available as Supplementary
Figures S7 and S8, respectively. The NPACT graphical comparison
of S—profiles and annotated coding regions of the two A. dehalo-
genans genomes showed in the vast majority of cases a strong corres—
pondence of sharp contrasts in S—profiles with annotated genes. The
statistical significance of these contrasts and their association with
annotated genes were in most cases confirmed by the identification
of corresponding hits. However, NPACT also identified several
ORFs with significant compositional periodicity not corresponding
to any of the annotated coding regions (Table 3). Most of these
ORFs occupied ‘inter—genic’ regions separating annotated genes
(Supplementary Fig. S6A for examples).

In a few cases, NPACT identified compositional periodicities
consistent with coding regions superimposed in a different frame to
annotated genes (Supplementary Fig. S6B). Overall, considerably
more missed or mis—annotated genes could be identified in Ad. 2CP—
C than in Ad. 2CP—1. Among newly identified ORFs, the majority
(55%) were conserved between the two strains (Supplementary
Table S15), as determined by > 30% similarity between the corres—
ponding proteins. In the majority of cases, we found homologs of
these newly identified ORFs among coding regions annotated in the
other strain (92.4% of newly identify ORFs from 2CP—C and 83.9%
of those from 2CP—1) whereas only 19 homologous—pairs were newly
identified in both genomes. Inclusion of the newly identified ORFs
resulted in similar number of genes encoded by the two genomes.

As in the analyses of 1000 genomes, we characterized each newly
identified ORF for conservation, among Anaeromyxobacter species/
strains, across species belonging to different genera of deltaproteobac—
teria, or across different phyla, and recorded if it was among genes
(identified by same stop—codon position) predicted by Prodigal,
Glimmer3.0, GeneMarkHMM, and GeneMark2.5. We also assigned
to each ORF a ‘Quality’ score based on visual examination of S—pro—
files (do S—profiles have the expected relations along the ORF?), good
correspondence between ORF and hit (does the hit cover most of the
ORF?), and positional relation with neighboring genes (does the ORF
fit within or between operons?). Results for all ORFs are reported
with available functional characterizations in Supplementary Tables
S16—S23, listed by strain and class of conservation.

Summary statistics on conservation of newly identified ORF
are reported in Table 4 in comparison to pre—annotated genes.
Most pre—annotated genes were conserved across genera (88.5%)
or phyla (83.1%), and virtually all were conserved among
Anaeromyxobacter species or strains. Among newly identified ORFs,
35.9% of those identified in 2CP—1 and 27.6% of those from 2CP—C

 

CDS is coding regions annotated in the genome. ORF includes potential
coding regions identiﬁed by three-base periodicity and not included in pub—
lished genome annotations. Numbers (percentages) refer to queries conserved
only up to the indicated taxonomic level. For example, ‘Genera’ corresponds
to the number (percentage) of queries with homologs identiﬁed across differ-
ent genera of deltaproteobacteria (phylum) but not in other phyla (E-
value < 1.0E—6).

were conserved at least across genera and mostly across phyla (Table
4). Many of the conserved ORFs newly identified in one strain were
homologs of genes annotated in the second strain (48 ORFs newly
identified in 2CP—C and 25 in 2CP—1) and most were functionally
characterized (Supplementary Tables S16 and S17). Some were identi—
fied as encoding widely conserved protein families, such as, in 2CP—C,
the ribosomal protein L28 and the molecular chaperone Dna], and in
2CP—1 chemotaxis protein CheY. Furthermore, virtually all the newly
predicted ORFs conserved across genera found in 2CP—C, and the ma—
jority of those found in 2CP—1, were predicted by most or all gene—pre—
dictors. Eighty—three ORFs from 2CP—C (Supplementary Table S18)
and nine ORFs from 2CP—1 (Supplementary Table S19) were con—
served only in Anaeromyxobacter species/strains. In contrast to the
ORFs conserved across genera and phyla, the vast majority of these
poorly conserved ORFs matched non—characterized hypothetical
genes. However, in most cases these functionally uncharacterized
ORFs were also supported by most gene prediction methods. We did
not identify any conserved homologs in the NCBI nr database for 166
ORFs (Supplementary Tables S20 and S21), most of which were not
or poorly supported by gene—prediction methods. Finally, 11 newly
identified ORFs appeared to be gene fragments (Supplementary
Tables S22 and S23).

Virtually all ORFs conserved across genera and phyla, as well as
those conserved between Anaeromyxobacter species or strains,
showed best (’i’i’i) or good (H) visual quality, and among these
most were confirmed by the majority of gene predictors (Fig. 4).

These results suggested that visual assessments of quality based on
compositional contrast and position are reliable indicators of the
coding capacity of an ORF, as supported by conservation and/or
computational prediction, and thus of the level of confidence in the
prediction. Furthermore, positional and compositional quality as
well as gene—prediction, mutually supported many potential genes
that could otherwise be excluded based on their lack of or limited
conservation (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Tables S18—S21).

4 Conclusions

Accuracy in genome annotation depends on successful integration of
the information provided by computational gene—prediction meth—
ods, by pre—existing annotations of closely related genomes, by gene
conservation, and by evidence of functionality and expression
(Koonin and Galperin, 2003; Madupu et al., 2010; Pati et al.,
2010). Given the inherent uncertainty in computational gene predic—
tion and in identification of homology, as well as the complexity of
whole—genome annotation, it is perhaps not surprising that studies
on conservation and functional characterization of genomic ORFs
(Warren et al., 2010), or of sets of genes automatically predicted by
Glimmer3.0 (Wood et al., 2012) showed evidence of several con—
served genes missing from genome annotations. We showed how
genes missed in prokaryotic genome annotations can be detected by
quantitative and visual frame analysis using intrinsic information
from three—base periodicity. Extending frame analysis from phase—
specificity in GC content to phase—specificity in any nucleotide type,
our procedures are applicable to sequences of variable composition.
Although NPACT is most effective on sequences of high GC content
(55% or higher), we showed that three—base periodicities are useful
to identify conserved coding regions missed by the annotations also
in genomes of lower GC content. Furthermore, because our method
only requires a few base pairs to determine the local composition of
the sequence, it can be used to identify potential coding regions in
sequences too short or compositionally too heterogeneous to derive
detailed sequence—specific gene models. These features make
NPACT a useful tool for the analysis of collections of DNA or
mRNA sequence fragments, such as those that can be obtained from
metagenomic sequencing projects.

We were surprised to discover that many three—periodic ORFs
not included in annotations were also predicted by most or all popu—
lar gene prediction methods, indicating that the slightly lower sensi—
tivity of the methods available and commonly used by the earliest
annotators—GeneMark2.5, published in 1993—does not explain
the exclusion of these ORFs from genome annotations. Lack of con—
servation or small size of an ORF could be criteria for excluding pre—
dicted genes as likely false positives. However, among the excluded
genes predicted by most methods, many were also relatively long,
were conserved in sequence and in length across distantly related
genomes, and were functionally characterized. These findings sug—
gest that the sensitivity and specificity of gene predictors is not the
only factor, and maybe not the dominant factor, limiting accuracy
of prokaryotic gene annotation. Bioinformatics tools that facilitate
comparison and visualization of information for the evaluation of
predicted genes across genome sequences, may have a greater impact
on the quality of gene annotations than could be achieved from im—
provements in computational gene—prediction algorithms. Along
these lines, we believe the representation of sequence features pro—
vided by NPACT can significantly contribute to the amelioration of
the annotations of high GC content (and other) genomes facilitating
the identification of true novel or predicted genes.

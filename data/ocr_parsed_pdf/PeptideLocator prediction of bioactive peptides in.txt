Bioactive peptide prediction

 

antifungal, antibacterial and antiparasitic peptides. Such data—
bases have facilitated the bioinformatic analysis of peptides, pro—
moting the creation of tools to aid in the identiﬁcation of
bioactive peptides.

The identiﬁcation of bioactive peptides within protein se—
quences is the first step in the development of a therapeutic
product. In food—based protein precursors, bioactive peptides
can be isolated by bacterial fermentation, or through the use of
gastrointestinal or alternative proteolytic enzymes (Korhonen
and Pihlanto, 2006; Vijayakumar et al., 2012). In silica strategies
used to detect novel bioactive peptides include the examination
of sequence and structure homology as well as the emerging
approaches of peptidomics (Sasaki et al., 2010). Homology—
based prediction of bioactivity has successfully identiﬁed many
instances of antimicrobial peptides (Lynn et al., 2004). Other
bioinformatic methods have been used to predict peptide modu—
lators of human platelet function (Edwards et al., 2007). As in
many applications of bioinformatics, tools for the prediction of
bioactivity have used propensity scales, which capture informa—
tion about the statistical preferences of different amino acids to
be bioactive peptides or not (Torrent et al., 2011). Other predic—
tion tools have been based on Support Vector Machines (Lata
et al., 2010; Thomas et al., 2010), hidden Markov models (Fjell
et al., 2007) or sequence alignments and feature selection (Wang
et al., 2011). Most tools focus on a particular class of bioactive
peptide prediction, for example, antimicrobial peptides; however,
PeptideRanker (Mooney et al., 2012), which has been developed
recently, is a general bioactive peptide predictor. These tools
predict the bioactivity of stand—alone peptide sequences but
they are not optimized for the discovery of bioactive peptides
within larger parent protein sequences, ignoring the protein con—
text of the bioactive peptide, which may provide additional
information.

Here, we have combined many classes of bioactive peptides
that are functionally distinct, but nevertheless have shared prop—
erties. Using the precursor protein sequences of these peptides,
retrieved from PeptideDB, we have trained bidirectional recur—
sive neural networks (BRNN), which take as input the protein
sequence and a number of predicted structural features of the
protein, and predict bioactive peptides within the protein se—
quence. As far as we are aware, only one other method exists
for the identiﬁcation of potential bioactive peptide regions within
a protein sequence, and this method is specialized for the predic—
tion of antimicrobial peptides (Torrent et al., 2012). We have
tested the performance of PeptideRanker on an independent
test set of antimicrobial peptides from APD2 and followed up
with an analysis of 661 food proteins from the BIOPEP
database.

2 METHODS

2.1 Training and test datasets

Proteins with bioactive peptides of length less than or equal to 50 residues
were retrieved from PeptideDB (Liu et al., 2008). From 6145 peptide
precursor protein sequences, we generated two internally redundancy-
reduced sets: PeptideDB.90, which was redundancy reduced to <90%
sequence similarity, leaving 4505 sequences, and PeptideDB.30, which
was redundancy reduced to <30% sequence similarity, leaving 2202 pro-
tein sequences. Supplementary Figure S1 shows the length of the

bioactive peptides plotted against the length of the precursor proteins
in both of these datasets.

To generate the PeptideLocator training dataset, we split the
PeptideDB.30 dataset into ﬁve equally sized test sets. The training set
for each test set was created by running a BLAST search (Altschul et al.,
1997) (e-value <0.001) of each sequence in the PeptideDB.90 dataset
against that test set. If a hit was found, then that sequence was removed.
This resulted in ﬁve 90% internal redundancy-reduced training sets with
no BLAST hit with an e-value <0.001 to any sequence in the correspond-
ing test set. In summary, no sequence in a test set had >30% sequence
similarity to any other sequence in that or any other test set and no
sequence was used in training a model of the network that has a
BLAST hit with an e-value <0.001 to a sequence used for testing that
model.

Each residue of every sequence in the datasets was labelled as either a
bioactive peptide residue or non-bioactive peptide residue (Table 1).
Secondary structure, solvent accessibility, structural motifs and disorder
were predicted for the full protein sequence using Porter (Pollastri and
McLysaght, 2005), PaleAle (Pollastri et al., 2007), Porter+ (Mooney
et al., 2006) and IUPred (Dosztanyi et al., 2005), respectively. Each resi-
due was labelled with the predicted probability of being in each of 3
classes in the case of secondary structure, 4 classes for solvent accessibil-
ity, 14 classes for structural motifs and a single label representing the
predicted probability of the residue being disordered. We included solvent
accessibility, secondary structure and structural motifs as they provide
information on the potential structure of the peptide. We included pre-
dicted disorder, as this may provide information not only on the peptide’s
structural state, but also the context of the peptide that may facilitate
biological release by proteolytic cleavage or biological activity as a
self-contained signalling motif unconstrained by adjacent ordered
regions.

The sequences were then split into domain/non-domain sections using
SMART (Letunic et al., 2009). The input to the BRNN for each domain/
non-domain protein section was the length of the section, the bioactive/
non-bioactive labels per residue, the three predicted structural features
(secondary structure, solvent accessibility and structural motifs), the pre-
dicted disorder per residue and a single extra input representing if the
section was, or was not, predicted to be a domain by SMART.

2.2 Independent test datasets

To create an independent test set, we retrieved any peptide from the
APD2 (Wang et al., 2009), which had information on the original protein
sequence from which it was derived. We then searched Swiss-Prot (The
UniProt Consortium, 2012) for the protein sequence. If the protein se-
quence was not longer than the peptide sequence, it was discarded. This
resulted in 132 unique protein sequences. We redundancy reduced this set
to <30% sequence similarity to any sequences in PeptideDB.90. This left
us with 15 protein sequences. Table 1 shows the number of residues per
class (bioactive/non-bioactive).

discrimination threshold from 0 to 1. The results are shown as a Receiver
Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve where TPR is plotted against FPR,
which are calculated as follows:

TPR — TP
_ TP+FN
FPR = L
FP+ TN

where

0 True positives: the number of residues predicted in a class that are
observed in that class.

0 False positives: the number of residues predicted in a class that are
not observed in that class.

0 True negatives: the number of residues predicted not to be in a class
that are not observed in that class.

0 False negatives: the number of residues predicted not to be in a class
that are observed in that class.

The area under the curve (AUC), which is equivalent to the probability
that the classiﬁer will rank a randomly chosen positive instance higher
than a randomly chosen negative instance (Fawcett, 2006) is also shown.
The AUC is a number between 0 and 1 where 0.5 indicates a random
model and 1 is perfect. R is used to plot the curves and calculate the AUC
(R Development Core Team, 2008). Speciﬁcity (Spec), sensitivity (Sen),
Matthews Correlation Coefﬁcient (MCC) and the accuracy (Q) at a 0.5
threshold are measured as follows:

TP TN — FP FN
MCC — X X

 

 

_ \/(TP + FP)(TP + FN)(TN + FP)(TN + FN)

MCC measures the correlation coefﬁcient between the observed and
predicted classiﬁcations. A value of 1 represents a perfect prediction, 0 a
random prediction and —1 an inverse prediction and is a good indicator

of the overall performance of the predictive methods for both bioactive
peptide and non-bioactive peptide residues.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

For every residue, PeptideLocator predicts the probability
between 0 and 1 of that residue being part of a bioactive peptide.
The closer the probability is to 1, the more confident
PeptideLocator is that the residue is part of a bioactive peptide.
The results in 5—fold cross—validation for the test dataset,
PeptideDB.30, are shown in Table 2 and in Supplementary
Figure S2A as a ROC curve with thresholds from 0 to 1, i.e.
the cut—off above which a residue is considered to be predicted as
a bioactive peptide residue. Specificity, sensitivity and the accu—
racy (Q) are well over 80%, with an AUC of 92% and MCC of
0.71 showing a strong correlation between predicted and the
observed classiﬁcations.

We chose secondary structure, solvent accessibility, structural
motifs and disorder as additional inputs into the network as we
considered these factors may contribute to the identification of a
bioactive peptide within a protein sequence. We trained the net—
works leaving out each of these in turn and found that the results

were similar in all cases (Q 85.1785.8%, AUC 0.914192) except
for when solvent accessibility was excluded (Q 80%, AUC 0.87).
This would seem to suggest that solvent accessibility contributes
most to the accuracy of the BRNN, however a model of the
network trained only including solvent accessibility resulted in
a Q of 83.7%, and an AUC of 0.90, compared to a Q of 85.8 and
an AUC of 0.92 when all four features are included. Given this
contribution to performance, we chose to retain all four features
in the predictor. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to reverse
engineer how the model decides on a prediction because it com—
presses the input sequence into many hidden states/features for
each residue, which do not correspond directly to any known
property of the protein.

Although the APD2.30 dataset is very small (15 sequences),
and is restricted to antimicrobial peptides only, we can see from
Table 2 that PeptideLocator is able to predict which class (bioac—
tive/non—bioactive) residues fall into with an accuracy of over
82%. Ninety percent of the bioactive peptide residues are pre—
dicted correctly. However, the FPR of 30.36% (i.e. the percen—
tage of non—bioactive peptide residues incorrectly predicted as
bioactive) is high. This could be corrected for example by
increasing the threshold to 0.8 which would decrease the FPR
to ~20% without reducing the TPR (see ROC curve
Supplementary Fig. S2B). For this reason we have chosen a
threshold of 0.8 for the food protein examples which we present
below. Improved larger databases of bioactive peptides linked to
precursor proteins will permit more accurate evaluation of the
performance of the method we have presented, in addition to
providing larger training sets for future methods development.

3.1 Peptide activity classes

To assess the ability of PeptideLocator to predict bioactive pep—
tides in other classes (not only antimicrobial peptides as in
APD2.30), we split the PeptideDB.30 results into six peptide
activity subsets: antifreeze, antimicrobial, cytokines and growth
factor, peptide hormones, toxins and venom, and unique/other.
The number of residues per class are shown in Table 3 and the
results are shown as ROC curves (Fig. 2). The classes for which
PeptideLocator is most accurate are antifreeze, antimicrobial and
toxins and venom, which all have AUCs 3 95%. PeptideLocator
performs worst on the cytokines and growth factor peptide activ—
ity subset, however an AUC of 86% is still high.

3.2 Predicted bioactive peptides in food proteins

To illustrate the functionality of PeptideLocator, the sequences
of all proteins stored in BIOPEP were retrieved from UniProt
(The UniProt Consortium, 2012). This amounted to 661 unique

proteins, primarily from food, which were redundancy reduced
with respect to the training set so that any protein with a BLAST
alignment with >30% sequence similarity to any protein in the
training set was removed, leaving 615 protein sequences
(Supplementary Fig. S3). The sequences were submitted to
PeptideLocator and the results were searched for proteins with
peptide regions with y residues over a threshold x. We selected
the 25 proteins which had at least 16 consecutive residues pre—
dicted over a threshold of 0.8 for further analysis (Supplementary
Table S1). None of these predicted peptide regions are found in
our training set.

Twelve of the proteins are <40 residues in length. For most of
these, the whole protein (or protein fragment) is labelled as
bioactive (using a threshold of 0.8), and in all cases, at least
80% of the residues are predicted over the 0.8 threshold. A
number of these predicted peptides are alpha—amylase inhibitors

from Rye (Secale cereale); alpha—amylase inhibitors are being
investigated as food additives to aid in weight loss (Barrett and
Udani, 2011). The sheep lactoferrin fragment (33 residue N—term—
inal peptide without signal peptide) has been shown to be an
inhibitor of platelet aggregation (Qian et al., 1995). The wheat
allergen peptide (ALCC_WHEAT) associated with Bakers
asthma (Amano et al., 1998) and wheat gluten, important in
coeliac disease, were also identiﬁed.

We found that for the medium length proteins (4&100 resi—
dues), the predicted peptide was either at the N— or C—terminus,
with the exception of TIM13_ORYSJ; three of the proteins
(DF39_PEA, Q9FUP3_PHACN and NOl4_PEA) had signal
peptides, which were not predicted as bioactive. For example,
PeptideLocator correctly predicted the Pisum sativum (Garden
pea) bioactive peptide from Defensin—like protein 39 and has not
predicted the signal peptide as bioactive (residues 1728, Fig. 3).

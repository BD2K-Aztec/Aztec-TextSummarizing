SGNSZ

 

the number of reactions, compartments and delayed events, allowing com-
plex models to be simulated in reasonable time.

To simulate cell division, we introduced a special reaction event, whose
timing follows the SSA rules. When executed, instead of subtracting sub-
strates from the system, a random number is generated based on one of the
several partitioning distributions available, including some of those listed in
Huh and Paulsson (2011). Each of these mimics a specific molecule parti-
tioning process during cell division. SGNS2 allows both biased and unbiased
partitioning of molecules and sub-compartments. The results of these events
can be instantaneous or be placed on the wait list. Compartment division
and molecule partitioning are represented in the following form:

split(p) : Protein@CellL—“> @Cell+ : Protein@Cell

When this reaction occurs, a new cell compartment is created (@Cell in the
product list). Proteins in the original cell are partitioned according to a
biased binomial partitioning scheme. In this, each protein is independently
partitioned into the new cell with probability [7. Other common partitioning
distributions include the independent partitioning of molecules into daugh-
ter cells with random (beta-distributed) sizes and the binding of molecules
to spindle binding sites which are segregated evenly between daughter cells
such as during mitosis. Available distributions are listed in the manual.

SGNS2 is a command line utility, designed to ﬁt into a toolchain, sup-
porting various input and output formats. Input can be speciﬁed in two
formats: SBML (Hucka et a/., 2003) and SGNSim’s native format (Ribeiro
and Lloyd-Price, 2007). A subset of SBML Core level 3 version 1 is sup-
ported, allowing simulation of most SBML models. Output can be in csv,
tsv or in binary format. A text editor may be used to write models in SGNSim
format. SBML-based graphical interfaces such as CellDesigner (F unahashi
et a/., 2008) or Cytoscape (Smoot et a/., 201 1) may be used to manage SBML
models. The results of simulations are interpretable by programs like
MATLAB, R or Excel. An example of running a model in SGNSim
format of a growing cell population is shown in Supplementary Figure S1.

3 DISCUSSION

SGNS2 is the first stochastic simulator that includes multi-delayed
events, dynamic compartments and molecule partitioning schemes
in division. To test its correctness, we simulated models from the
Discrete Stochastic Model Test Suite (Evans et al., 2008). All
showed the expected behavior (Supplementary Figs S2 and S3).

SGNS2, though making use of existing and slightly modiﬁed
versions of existing algorithms, can simulate an array of biological
processes not previously possible. For example, it is ideal for simu-
lating gene expression at the nucleotide and codon levels (see
‘Availability’ section) and study features such as how events in
transcription elongation affect protein production kinetics
(Makela et al., 2011).

SGNS2 is also suited to study partitioning in cell division, which
affects aging, among other processes, and is of particular relevance
when modeling populations over multiple generations. To exemplify
this, we modeled the biased partitioning of protein aggregates in E.
cali, known to accumulate in cells with older poles, reducing vitality
(Lindner et a1., 2008). The results in Supplementary Figure S4 agree
with measurements (Stewart et al., 2005). We further studied how
cell-cycle synchrony affects the population-level statistics of RNA
numbers [Supplementary Fig. S5, in agreement with measurements
in Lloyd-Price et a]. (2012)]. As a side note, we expect the partition-
ing of RNA and proteins to affect the dynamics of genetic circuits,
particularly the stability of their noisy attractors (Ribeiro and
Kauffman, 2007). To further demonstrate the simulator’s utility,
we modeled the viral infection of a dynamic bacterial population.

In conclusion, SGNS2 provides novel functionalities to model
and simulate cellular processes not previously possible, as seen
from the examples. In general, SGNS2 enables the modeling of
stochastic processes in live cells that require compartmentaliza—
tion, multi—delayed complex processes and complex stochastic par-
titioning schemes at a per-molecule type in cell division. These
features are necessary to study in silica, among other phenomena,
phenotypic diversity in cell populations.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Messenger RNA expression is important in normal devel-
opment and differentiation, as well as in manifestation of disease.
RNA-seq experiments allow for the identiﬁcation of differentially
expressed (DE) genes and their corresponding isoforms on a
genome-wide scale. However, statistical methods are required to
ensure that accurate identifications are made. A number of methods
exist for identifying DE genes, but far fewer are available for identifying
DE isoforms. When isoform DE is of interest, investigators often apply
gene-level (count-based) methods directly to estimates of isoform
counts. Doing so is not recommended. In short, estimating isoform
expression is relatively straightfonNard for some groups of isoforms,
but more challenging for others. This results in estimation uncertainty
that varies across isoform groups. Count-based methods were not
designed to accommodate this varying uncertainty, and consequently,
application of them for isoform inference results in reduced power for
some classes of isoforms and increased false discoveries for others.
Results: Taking advantage of the merits of empirical Bayesian meth-
ods, we have developed EBSeq for identifying DE isoforms in an
RNA-seq experiment comparing two or more biological conditions.
Results demonstrate substantially improved power and performance
of EBSeq for identifying DE isoforms. EBSeq also proves to be a
robust approach for identifying DE genes.

1 INTRODUCTION

Appropriate expression of a gene’s isoforms Via alternative spli-
cing is fundamental to normal development and maintenance in
eukaryotes, and aberrations in alternative splicing are common
in disease (Smith et al., 1989; Stamm et al., 2005; Wang et al.,

2008). Consequently, there is much interest in identifying iso-
forms with expression that varies on average across biological
conditions. High-throughput cDNA sequencing (RNA-seq) ex-
periments provide the potential to identify such differentially
expressed (DE) isoforms on a genome-wide scale, but statistical
methods are required to ensure that accurate identiﬁcations are
made.

The statistical methods available for identifying diﬁ’erences in
isoforms in an RNA-seq experiment [e.g. MISO (Katz et al.,
2010), FDM (Singh et al., 2011), Chi-Square test in Howard
and Heber (2010)] have focused on changes in the proportion
of gene-speciﬁc reads assigned to an isoform, so-called differen-
tial transcription (DT) or differential splicing (DS). These meth-
ods do not consider changes in overall expression levels and are
therefore not appropriate for identifying DE isoforms. For ex-
ample, consider a gene with two isoforms: the ﬁrst with average
counts 500 and 1500 in conditions 1 and 2, respectively, the
second with average counts 1000 and 3000 in the two conditions,
respectively. These isoforms would not be DT or DS, given that
the proportion of total reads assigned to each isoform is un-
changed across conditions (1 /3 for isoform 1 and 2/3 for isoform
2), but the isoforms would likely be called DE, given there is a
3-fold increase in expression in the second condition. When
isoform-level DE calls are required, count-based methods de-
veloped for identifying DE genes are often applied directly to
estimates of isoform expression (Sandmann et al., 2011). Doing
so is not optimal.

The main problem is that count-based methods expect counts,
or more speciﬁcally, an integer summary of reads mapping to a
gene’s constituent exons, and they were not designed to accom-
modate the differential uncertainty induced by isoform expres-
sion estimation. In short, prior to isoform DE inference, each
isoform’s expression must be estimated from aligned reads. For
genes with a single isoform, this problem is rather straightfor-
ward in that all reads mapping to that gene are used to estimate
that isoforms’ expression. For genes with multiple isoforms, iso-
form expression estimation is more difﬁcult, as reads mapping to
exons common to multiple isoforms must be allocated in a way
consistent with each isoform’s expression level, which is the very
quantity being estimated. There are a number of methods avail-
able for estimating isoform expression [RSEM (Li and Dewey,
2011), RSeq (Jiang and Wing, 2009), IsoEM (Nicolae et al.,

2010), Cufﬁinks (Trapnell et al., 2012) and IQSeq (Du et al.,
2012)]. Whatever method used, due to the increased difﬁculty
inherent in estimating isoform expression for isoforms with
common constitutive exons, there are varying levels of uncer-
tainty in isoform expression estimates (see Fig. 1). Most
approaches for identifying DE in an RNA-seq experiment
focus on genes [DESeq (Anders and Huber, 2010), edgeR
(Robinson and Smyth, 2007), baySeq (Hardcastle and Kelly,
2010), BBSeq (Zhou et al., 2011)], and do not accommodate
this differential uncertainty. Consequently, they are not appro-
priate for identifying DE isoforms. Another recently developed
approach [DEXSeq (Anders et al., 2012)] may be used for iden-
tifying DE exons, but does not provide information on which
associated isoforms are DE.

When isoform DE is of interest, some count-based methods
(e.g. edgeR) suggest choosing a single isoform [such as the iso-
form with the most counts within a gene or the longest isoform
(Sandmann et al., 2011)] and estimating expression using reads
mapping to the isoforms’ constituent exons. In either case, infor-
mation on other isoforms is lost, and reads mapping to multiple
genes are ignored. A more serious consideration is that erroneous
conclusions may be made due to differences in other isoforms
(see Fig. 1b for an example). Other methods such as
easyRNASeq suggest that one assign all reads mapping to over-
lapping exons to each isoform separately (i.e. count reads map-
ping to exon 2 in Fig. 1b twice, once for each isoform), and then
proceed with a count-based approach. As with the prior

 

suggestion, this can lead to erroneous conclusions. Specifically,
an isoform may appear to be equally expressed (EE, say isoform
1 in Fig. 1b), even if it is not.

A potentially more robust way to proceed is to estimate each
isoform’s mRNA counts using a method designed speciﬁcally to
do so (Jiang and Wing, 2009; Li and Dewey, 2011; Nicolae et al.,
2010; Trapnell et al., 2012) and then apply a count-based ap-
proach directly to expected counts after rounding the expected
counts to the nearest integer. This, too, is not advised.
Count-based methods require gene-level counts and conse-
quently do not account for uncertainty inherent in estimated
counts. Furthermore, given that uncertainty varies systematically
for different groups of isoforms, applications of count-based
approaches for isoform level inference result in reduced power
for some classes of isoforms and increased false discoveries for
others. In short, the test statistics used by most methods for DE
gene identiﬁcation calibrate a difference in expression levels be-
tween conditions by a variance, which is commonly estimated
using the meanivariance relationship observed in data. Figure 1c
shows that this relationship varies dramatically for different
groups of isoforms, where groups are deﬁned by the number
of constituent isoforms of the parent gene (other deﬁnitions
are possible as discussed below). Speciﬁcally, an isoform of
gene g is assigned to the I 2k group, for example, where
k = 1,2 or 3, if the total number of isoforms from gene g is k
(the Ig = 3 group contains all isoforms from genes having 3 or
more isoforms).

Fig. 1. Panel (a) shows two hypothetical genes g and g’. Gene g has one isoform, denoted by I = 1; gene g’ has two (I i = 2). The problem of estimating
expression for isoforms of g’ is complicated by the fact that reads mapping to exon 2 must be unambiguously assigned to each isoform. This results in
increased uncertainty, on average, in expression estimates for isoforms sharing a parent. Panel (b) shows hypothetical expression of the isoforms from
gene g’ in each of two conditions (assuming differences in library size have been accommodated). If one focuses on the longest isoform (isoform 1) and
uses all reads mapping to its constituent isoforms to estimate its expression, the isoform is called equivalently expressed, as there are 30 (6 + 22 + 2) reads
mapped in condition 1 and 30 (10+ 16+4) mapped in condition 2. However, if the expression of other isoforms is considered, it becomes clear that
isoform 1 contains almost twice as many reads in condition 2 as in condition 1 (23 versus 13, respectively). Panel (c) demonstrates how estimation
uncertainty changes as isoform complexity increases. We quantiﬁed isoform complexity here by Ig where the Ig = k group represents isoforms from genes
with k isoforms (here isoforms from genes with more than three isoforms are included in the Ig = 3 group; alternative deﬁnitions of complexity are
discussed in the text). Shown top right are splines ﬁt to the empirical variance as a function of the mean for all isoforms as well as isoforms within groups
deﬁned by Ig for the two-group human embryonic stem cell RNA-seq experiment described in Section 2; bottom right considers isoforms with average
expression (expected count) in [100, 500]. The range was chosen as it approximates the 50th and 80th percentiles of expression across all isoforms. Shown
are box plots of the variances of these isoforms collectively, and within Ig group. Median variance within each group is shown right

As shown in Figure 1c, there is decreased variability in the
Ig = 1 group, but increased variability in the others, due to the
relative increase in uncertainty inherent in estimating isoform
expression when multiple isoforms of a given gene are present.
This observation is not speciﬁc to the dataset and/or the method
used for isoform expression estimation; it is also not speciﬁc to
the particular method used for quantifying isoform complexity
(see Supplementary Figs S17S4 for additional examples). If iso-
forms are analysed collectively, there is reduced power for iden-
tifying isoforms in the Ig = 1 group (since the true variances in
that group are lower, on average, than those derived from the full
collection of isoforms) and increased false discoveries in the
Ig = 2 and Ig = 3 groups (since the true variances are higher,
on average, than those derived from the full collection). These
effects are demonstrated in a simulation study in Section 4 of the
Supplementary Material.

Cuffdiff2 (Trapnell et al., 2013) and BitSeq (Glaus et al., 2012)
account for differential uncertainty in isoform expression esti-
mates and thus appropriately accommodate DE inference at
the isoform level. However, Cuffdiff2 often finds fewer genes
than comparable approaches, and the simulations here suggest
this is a result of lack of power, as opposed to an increased false
discovery rate (FDR) of other methods. BitSeq is a good alter-
native when ranking isoforms is of interest, but it does not pro-
vide a way to control a list of identifications at a desired level of
FDR. Finally, both approaches couple expression estimation
with DE inference, and are not applicable to expression estimates
obtained separately (e. g. Via RSEM or one of the other methods
mentioned above). As other expression-estimation methods have
demonstrated higher precision and continue to be improved,
methods for DE inference that accept expression estimates dir-
ectly are desirable.

Taking advantage of the merits of empirical Bayesian (EB)
methods, we developed an approach called EBSeq for inference
in an RNA-seq experiment. Although its main advantage over
other approaches is in its ability to identify DE isoforms, results
from simulations and case studies demonstrate good perform-
ance for identiﬁcation of DE genes as well.

2 METHODS

2.1 EBSeq: an empirical Bayes model for identifying DE
genes and isoforms

EBSeq requires gene counts or estimates of isoform expression,
but it is not speciﬁc to any particular estimation method (e.g.
RSEM, Rseq, Cufﬁinks or another method may be used). The
general model is developed for isoform analysis. The gene-level
model is a special case discussed at the end of this section. The
model assumes the expected count for isoform 1' in gene g and
sample 3 is distributed as Negative Binomial, X gm, where
g=1,2,...,G, s=1,2,...,S and i: 1,2,...,Ng; Ng denotes
the number of isoforms of gene g. Speciﬁcally, we assume that
within condition C, ngvlrgi‘ols, q; ~ NB(rgi‘ol,, (1;), where [S rep-
resents the library size in sample 3 and may be deﬁned as the total
number of reads or obtained by TMM (Robinson and Oshlack,
2010), Median Normalization (Anders and Huber, 2010) or
Upper Quartile Normalization (Bullard et al., 2010). Since the
total number of reads may be adversely affected by outliers from

PCR or other artifacts, the latter three methods are recom-
mended. The EBSeq code defaults to Median Normalization,
but Quantile Normalization is also available. Within this frame-
work, the mean and variance are given by: M; = rgi‘ 0(1 — (La/q;
and (cg? = rgma — q§)/(q§)2-

A prior distribution describes ﬂuctuations in technical and
biological variation: qgla, [3’3 ~ Beta(a, 5’3). The hyper-param-
eter a is shared across isoforms while )3 depends on lg, accom-
modating the systematic differences in variability among the Ig
groups. Ig quantiﬁes a measure of isoform complexity and may
be defined by the user as the number of isoforms from a gene, as
described in the previous section, or from an isoform’s mapp-
ability score or credibility interval as provided by some isoform
expression-estimation approaches.

When RNA-seq reads in two biological conditions are avail-
able, identifying DE isoforms corresponds to identifying those
isoforms for which [LEI 75 “[22. Since rgi‘o is common across
conditions, this is analogous to identifying those isoforms for
which (1:1 75 (1:2. Letting 1) denote the prior probability of DE,
counts are modelled by the mixture distribution
(1 —p)f10g(Xgl’C2)+pf]g(Xgl’C2) where Xgl’cz represents g,’s
read counts across the two conditions; f0 and f1 are the predictive
distributions under EE and DE, respectively:

Estimates of the isoform-speciﬁc means and variances are
obtained Via method-of-moments, and the four global hyper-
parameters (a, )3] =1, ﬂlg=2 and ﬂlg=3) are obtained Via the
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster et al.,
1977) (see Section 6 of the Supplementary Material for further
details). With parameter estimates in hand, the posterior prob-
ability of DE (or EE) is obtained Via Bayes’ rule. A mixture
model with additional components may be used when data
from more than two conditions are available (an example is
provided in Section 6 of the Supplementary Material). Unless
otherwise noted, all calculations were carried out in R (R
Development Core Team, 2009); package and annotation ver-
sions are given in Section 1 of the Supplementary Material.

2.2 Simulated data

We followed the simulation set-up of Robinson and Smyth
(2007) by deﬁning counts as Negative Binomial with isoform-
speciﬁc mean in sample 3 and condition C given by [mg and
variance [Saga + ls/tgqbgi). The library size factors for both the
isoform and gene-level simulations were randomly simulated
from Uniform (0.8, 1.3). One hundred simulated datasets were
generated for each scenario considered.

Sim I: Isoform expression for each of 30 802 isoforms, four
lanes in each of two conditions, is generated by sampling un-
known parameters (Mgi,¢gi) from the case study comparing

embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs). The number of isoforms and sample sizes are taken to
match those in the case study. The percentages of DE isoforms
were set at 2, 4 and 5% in the Ig = 1,2 and 3 groups, also to
match the case study data. Parameters for isoforms belonging to
the same gene are sampled together to preserve dependence
within isoforms common to a single gene. For DE isoforms,
[2:1 = [2:1 * 8g, where 8g, is sampled from the 9&97% quantile
of fold changes in sample means across conditions; for EE
isoforms [2:1 = “:2.

Sim II: Isoform expression for each of 30 802 isoforms is gen-
erated by sampling (agi) from case study data; (pg, is ﬁxed for all
g,. Six sets of simulations are considered to investigate the effects
of systematic changes in variability, one set for each ()5 in
(5 *10’4, 1* 10’3, 5 *10’3, 1* 10’2, 5 *10’2, 1* 10"); DE
and EE are as in Sim I. This set-up is similar to that considered
in Robinson and Smyth (2007). There, too, Mg, is sampled and q)
is fixed, but here we simulate isoforms (not genes) and we con-
sider more (and slightly different values) of ()5. An evaluation of
the exact simulation set-up considered in Robinson and Smyth
(2007) is given in Supplementary Figure S8.

Sim III: Gene expression for each of 20 000 genes is generated
by sampling unknown parameters (Mg, (pg) from case study data.
Two per cent DE genes are simulated to match the case study
data.

The Supplementary Material provides details on additional
simulations (see Supplementary Material Section 4) and demon-
strates that characteristics observed in the case study data are
reproduced in the simulated datasets considered here (see
Supplementary Fig. S5). Supplementary Figure S8 also shows
results from the simulations considered in the articles introducing
edgeR and baySeq.

2.3 Experimental data

2.3.] MicroArray Quality Control data The raw read ﬁles (fasta
format) were downloaded from SRA SRX016359 and
SRX016367. As part of the MicroArray Quality Control
(MAQC) project, RNA was extracted from one sample of
human brain tissue (HBR) and one sample of mixtures of tissues
(UHR); seven replicates from each sample are considered here.
To obtain gene counts using HTSeq, reads were aligned to
the human RefSeq Hg18 transcripts using Bowtie (Langmead
et al., 2009) and TopHat (Trapnell et al., 2009), allowing
for no multiple matches (HTSeq requires that multi-reads are
discarded) and two mismatches. HTSeq was applied to obtain
gene counts for 18780 genes, in which 16518 were expressed
(with median expression greater than 0). To obtain estimates
of expression Via Cufﬂinks (Trapnell et al., 2010), Bowtie and
Tophat were applied allowing for up to 20 multiple matches
and two mismatches. Expression was then estimated using
Cufﬂinks (Trapnell et al., 2010) for 18 780 genes and 30802
isoforms, in which 17152 genes and 26210 isoforms were
expressed.

2.3.2 Thomson Lab data; ES versus iPS cell lines We analysed
RNA-seq data from the James Thomson Lab at the Morgridge
Institute for Research at UW-Madison. Details on the samples
are given in Phanstiel et al. (2011); the particular samples

considered here as well as alignment and expression estimation
vary from that reported in Phanstiel et al. (2011) as follows. We
evaluate RNA-seq reads from embryonic stem (ES) cell lines H1,
H7, H9 and H14 and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell lines
DF4.7, DF6.9, DF19.7 and DFl9.ll. We ﬁlter 42-base pair
reads to remove adapters in each lane. To obtain gene counts
Via HTSeq, reads were aligned to the human RefSeq Hg18 tran-
scripts using Bowtie and TopHat, allowing for no multiple
matches and two mismatches. HTSeq was then applied to
obtain gene counts for 18780 genes, in which 15671 were ex-
pressed. To obtain estimates of gene and isoform expression Via
Cufﬁinks, Bowtie and Tophat were applied, allowing for up to
20 multiple matches and two mismatches. Expression was then
estimated using Cufﬂinks.

Two other datasets (Gould Lab and Smith Lab) are shown in
Figure 2c; details on these datasets may be found in Section 2 of
the Supplementary Material.

2.4 Identiﬁcation of DE genes and isoforms

EBSeq is compared with baySeq (1.1.0), BitSeq (1.2.1), Cuffdiff2
(2.0.1), DESeq (1.8.2) and edgeR (2.6.3). Further information on
package defaults, annotation versions and other software is given
in Section 1 of the Supplementary Material. To quantify evidence
in favour of DE, EBSeq and baySeq provide posterior probabil-
ities whereas DESeq, edgeR and Cuffdiff2 provide P—Values,
which are adjusted for multiplicities using BenjaminiiHochberg
(DESeq, edgeR) or by converting to q-values (Cuffdiff2). To
construct a list of DE genes/isoforms with target two-sided
FDR a, we considered those genes/isoforms for which the pos-
terior probability of DE was 31— a (baySeq and EBseq) or
those genes/isoforms for which adjusted P—Values were 5a
(DESeq, edgeR, Cuffdiff2). BitSeq provides the posterior prob-
ability of a positive log-ratio (PPLR) for rank ordering isoforms,
but does not detail how to use the PPLR to control FDR for
two-sided test. Consequently, BitSeq is evaluated when ranking
isoforms, but not when FDR controlled lists are considered.

Non-expressed genes and isoforms are ﬁltered out prior to
applying baySeq, DESeq, edgeR and EBSeq. The non-expressed
genes and isoforms are deﬁned as the ones with zero median
expression across all the samples. Cuffdiff2 also removes genes
or isoforms with low expression, but has additional criteria that
concern whether an isoform contains enough reads in each locus
and whether one or more replicates produce a value for the tran-
script outside of the conﬁdence interval generated when pooling
replicates together. Acceptable isoforms are called ‘OK’ in
Cuffdiff2.

2.5 Identiﬁcation of outliers

To identify putative outliers in the case studies, for each gene we
evaluated Dixon’s Q—statistic (Dixon, 1950) as well as the fold
change ratio (FCRatio). A Dixon’s Q-statistic for a collection of
values is deﬁned as the gap over range, where gap is the absolute
difference between the potential outlier in question and the
number closest to it; the range is the max minus min. For each
gene in each condition, we calculated Dixon’s Q-statistics for the
smallest and the largest value. The sample with the largest
Dixon’s Q—statistic was deﬁned as the potential outlier for that
gene; and the largest Dixon’s Q-statistic (over the two

isoforms unacceptable prior to analysis; isoforms deemed acceptable by Cuffdiff2 are denoted ‘OK’; and results are reported here for both (see Section 2
for more details). Panel (b) shows the operating characteristics of EBSeq and Cuffdiff2 as a function of d), described in Sim II. The solid and dashed lines

to use the PPLR scores to control FDR for two-sided test. Consequently, BitSeq is evaluated when ranking isoforms in Panel (a), but not when

FCRatio is the ratio of the fold change without the outlier over
the fold change with the outlier. A gene containing an outlier will
have a Dixon’s Q-statistic near 1 and FCRatio far from 1.

3 RESULTS

Simulation studies were conducted to investigate the operating
characteristics of EBSeq and to assess how EBSeq compares with
competing approaches. As detailed in Section 2, each simulated
dataset derives counts from a Negative Binomial model. The
Negative Binomial assumption is common to each method con-
sidered here (Anders and Huber, 2010; Hardcastle and Kelly,
2010; Robinson and Smyth, 2007; Trapnell et al., 2012), and
should therefore not provide advantage, or lack thereof, to any
one method in particular. Furthermore, the form of the variance
is not one we assumed in EBSeq; rather, it was prescribed in the
simulation set-up of Robinson and Smyth (2007). Three sets of
simulations are considered here. Additional simulations are eval-
uated in Section 4 of the Supplementary Material.

For evaluation of isoform-level inference, EBSeq is compared
with Cuffdiff2 and BitSeq. It is important to note that Cuffdiff2
and BitSeq are not stand-alone packages that accept counts dir-
ectly. Rather, Cuffdiff2 requires as input aligned reads that are
subsequently processed through Cufﬁinks to estimate counts;
BitSeq is similar, requiring that reads are processed through
BitSeq stage 1. This is important, as in the isoform simulation
studies (Sims I and II), simulated counts were transformed back
to reads as was done in RSEM (Li and Dewey, 2011); the reads
were then processed Via Cufﬁinks (or BitSeq stage 1) prior to
analysis. The transformation is not possible with simulated gene
counts, as multiple read count conﬁgurations can give rise to the
same overall gene count, and as a result, Cuffdiff2 is not evalu-
ated in the gene simulations; it is evaluated at the gene-level on
both MAQC project and case study data. BitSeq is not evaluated
in any gene-level analysis, as the PPLR provided for each iso-
form is derived from isoform-speciﬁc Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) samples, and no information is provided on
combining the chains to derive a gene-level PPLR.

3.1 Simulation-based evaluation of EBSeq, Cuffdiff2 and
BitSeq for identifying DE isoforms

Table 1 shows the power and FDR for EBSeq and Cuffdiff2
averaged across 100 Sim I simulations for a target FDR of
5%. Cuffdiff2 deems some isoforms unacceptable prior to ana-
lysis. Acceptable isoforms are called ‘OK’ in Cuffdiff2, and so
results are reported for all genes as well as those deemed ‘OK’ by
Cuffdiff2. Because BitSeq provides PPLR for rank ordering iso-
forms, but does not specify how to use PPLR to construct a list
of DE isoforms with a target FDR, it is not shown in Table 1.
BitSeq is evaluated in the ROC curves shown in Figure 2.

As shown in Table 1, Cuffdiff2 has well controlled FDR, but
reduced power compared with EBSeq (~44% versus ~72%); the
FDR of EBSeq is slightly elevated (~8%). Panel (a) of Figure 2
shows qualitatively similar results for lists of varying size, not
determined by targeting a speciﬁc FDR. In particular, the ROC
curves [empirical true positive rate (TPR) versus empirical false
positive rate (FPR) for lists of increasing size] show that the TPR
is higher than Cuffdiff2 for lists provided by EBSeq for all FPRs
considered. BitSeq also provided higher TPR than Cuffdiff2
across all FPRs, and showed comparable performance with
EBSeq.

A closer look into the DE calls from the Sim I simulations
reveals that operating characteristics are sensitive to ()5, which
determines within-isoform variability. To demonstrate the ef-
fects, panel (b) of Figure 2 shows power and FDR for six
other sets of simulations where q) is ﬁxed at a specific value (de-
tailed in Sim II). The solid lines show that the power of both
methods decreases as variability (<15) increases, with a greater loss
in power for Cuffdiff2; the dashed lines show that FDR increases
slightly but remains well-controlled for both methods. Panel (c)
shows the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of q) in four
empirical datasets as well as the average CDF from 100 Sim I
simulations to demonstrate that the values of ()5 considered in
panel (b) are typical of those observed in data. Panel (c) also
demonstrates systematic differences between the three datasets
with biological replicates and the MAQC data. Given that the
MAQC data is made up of technical replicates, it is not surpris-
ing to observe relatively smaller values of ()5 compared with

characteristics of DE identification methods vary with q) [as
shown in panel (b)], an evaluation of methods based on
MAQC data alone is cautioned. Below we evaluate methods
using MAQC as well as simulated data.

3.2 Evaluation of EBSeq, Cuffdiff2, DESeq, edgeR and
baySeq for identifying DE genes using MAQC and
simulated data

To evaluate EBSeq as well as other methods for gene-level infer-
ence, we use data from the MAQC Project (Consortium, 2006) as
well as simulated datasets. The RNA-seq data from the MAQC
Project has been widely used to evaluate RNA-seq quantiﬁcation
and normalization methods (Bullard et al., 2010; Li and Dewey,
2011). In particular, Taq-Man qRT-PCR measurements for 1000
genes are available; the 716 of these having consistent annota-
tions in the RefSeq Hg18 reference are often used as a
gold-standard for evaluation (for more details, see Li and
Dewey, 2011).

To evaluate baySeq, DESeq and edgeR, counts were obtained
Via HTSeq; expression was estimated Via Cufﬂinks to evaluate
Cuffdiff2. Since EBSeq can accept counts or estimated counts as
input, it is evaluated on both HTSeq-derived counts as well as
Cufﬂinks—processed data. Of the 716 gold-standard genes, EBSeq
and Cuffdiff2 identify 530 and 490 DE genes, respectively, at a
target FDR of 5%. Although the majority of identiﬁcations are
common to both approaches, some insight may be gained by
considering those genes identiﬁed exclusively by each approach
(57 are found by EBSeq but not Cuffdiff2 and 17 are identiﬁed
by Cuffdiff2 but not EBSeq). The top panel of Figure 3 shows
differences in these genes. In particular, the genes identified ex-
clusively by EBSeq reproduce in the RT-PCR measurements
[panel (a)], and they have larger fold changes [panel (b)], suggest-
ing that most of the additional genes found by EBSeq are in fact
true discoveries.

Panel (c) shows ROC curves for all methods derived using the
same thresholds as in Bullard et al. (2010). Speciﬁcally, we deﬁne
genes with an absolute value of log2 qRT-PCR fold change >2 as
DE; genes with absolute value of log2 qRT-PCR fold change
<0.2 are deﬁned as EE. Using these thresholds, 286 of the 716
genes are classiﬁed as either DE (200) or EE (86). When the FPR
is <20%, panel (c) shows that EBSeq performs best across all the
methods; baySeq is slightly better than DESeq and edgeR, while
Cuffdiff2 shows the lowest power. When FPR is >30%, baySeq,

Fig. 3. Panel (a) shows the fold changes (log2 scale) from RNA-seq
versus PCR for the 57 genes identiﬁed by EBSeq but not Cuffdiff2 and
the 17 genes identiﬁed by Cuffdiff2 but not EBSeq out of the 716
gold-standard genes from the MAQC dataset. Panel (b) shows box
plots of the absolute value of RNA-seq fold changes (log2 scale) for the
same 57 and 17 genes, as well as the 2131 and 457 genes identiﬁed ex-
clusively by EBSeq and Cuffdiff2, respectively, in the full set of genes.
Panel (c) shows ROC curves for baySeq, DESeq, edgeR, Cuffdiff2 and
EBSeq. Cuffdiff2 and EBSeq are applied to gene expression estimated via
Cufﬂinks. Results from EBSeq applied to gene expression counts derived
from HTSeq are similar (data not shown). The ROC curves based on
another threshold in Bullard et al. are shown in panel ((1)

DESeq, edgeR, EBSeq and Cuffdiff2 (‘OK’) perform similarly.
The ROC curves based on another threshold in Bullard et al. are
shown in panel (d).

Each of the count-based methods was also applied to 100 Sim
III datasets. Table 2 shows the power and FDR of each method
at 5% target FDR averaged over the 100 simulated datasets. In
short, all methods have well-controlled FDR. EBSeq shows the
highest power (~79%), with DESeq and edgeR showing com-
parable performance (~73%), and although baySeq seems to
outperform DESeq and edgeR with respect to ranking genes
(as demonstrated in the ROC curves shown in Fig. 3c and d),
it has lower power (~61%) than both DESeq and edgeR when
FDR is controlled at 5%. Section 4 of the Supplementary
Material shows that FDR is affected by outliers. In particular,
although the FDR of edgeR is well-controlled overall, simulation
results suggest that the false calls that are made by edgeR are
almost always in genes with outliers. The ROC curves averaging
100 Sim III datasets are shown in Supplementary Figure S10.

3.3 Case study of human embryonic stem cell lines

To further evaluate and compare methods, we analyse data from
an experiment comparing human ES cell lines with iPS cell lines
using DESeq, edgeR and baySeq (with expression counts ob-
tained from HTSeq) as well as Cuffdiff2 (with expression

estimated Via Cufﬁinks). EBSeq is evaluated on both HTSeq-
and Cufﬁinks-processed data. DESeq, edgeR, baySeq and
Cuffdiff2 identify 127, 377, 34 and 54 DE genes at 5% FDR,
respectively. EBSeq identiﬁes 334 from HTSeq counts and 351
from Cufﬁinks estimated counts. These results are largely con-
sistent with those observed in the simulation studies.

Recall that gene-level simulations and MAQC analysis dem-
onstrate that EBSeq has slightly increased power over DESeq
and edgeR; baySeq and Cuffdiff2 are underpowered compared
with these other approaches; and all methods have well-
controlled FDR. They also suggest that the false discoveries
that are identiﬁed by edgeR are likely due to outliers. In the

The empirical power and FDR of baySeq, DESeq, edgeR
and EBSeq averaged across 100 Sim III simulations where
target FDR was set at 5%. Standard errors on average
power (FDR) were <2.5% (1.4%) and are not shown.

case study, EBSeq finds more genes than DESeq; baySeq and
Cuffdiff2 find far fewer than either method; edgeR identiﬁes
most genes. As we have no gold standard in this case study, it
is difﬁcult to assess whether the genes identiﬁed exclusively by
EBSeq (or edgeR) are the result of improved power (i.e. they are
true discoveries) or an increased FDR. As we detail below, a
close consideration of the genes identified exclusively by each
method suggests that EBSeq shows improved power.

In particular, panels (a) and (b) of Figure 4 show the number
of genes found by each approach. There are 114 genes found by
DESeq, edgeR and EBSeq Via HTSeq-processed data; 161 genes
found exclusively by EBSeq (neither DESeq nor edgeR ﬁnd
these); and 197 found exclusively by edgeR (neither DESeq nor
EBSeq find these). Figure 4c shows box plots of Dixon’s
Q-statistics for these 114, 161 and 197 genes. As shown, the
genes exclusively identiﬁed by edgeR tend to have higher
Dixon’s Q-statistics, and are therefore more likely to contain
outliers. Of course a gene may contain an outlier and still be
DE. To assess this possibility, Figure 4d considers how a
gene’s fold change changes when its most extreme value is
removed, as quantiﬁed by the FCRatio. If a gene’s most extreme
value is not largely responsible for the DE call, fold changes with
and without the value will remain largely unchanged, and
FCRatio will be near one (see Section 2). As shown, edgeR
tends to favour genes with FCRatios far from 1, suggesting
that the genes identiﬁed may be due to a single outlier in an
otherwise EE gene. Supplementary Figure S11 shows nine

Fig. 4. Results are shown for the human embryonic stem cell case study, which compares ESCs with iPSCs. Panel (a) shows a Venn diagram of the genes
identiﬁed as DE by DESeq, edgeR or EBSeq using HTSeq for quantiﬁcation. Panel (b) shows a Venn diagram of the genes identified by Cuffdiff2 and
EBSeq using Cuﬁlinks-processed data. Panel (c) shows box plots of Dixon’s Q-statistics in three groups of genesithe 114 identiﬁed by DESeq, edgeR
and EBSeq; the 161 identiﬁed by EBSeq but not DESeq or edgeR; and the 196 identiﬁed by edgeR but not DESeq or EBSeq. Panel ((1) shows the
FCRatios and Dixon’s Q-statistics of the genes identiﬁed exclusively by each method, but not the other four methods (in this panel, ﬁve methods are
compared). Note that baySeq, Cuffdiff2, DESeq, edgeR and EBseq (via HTSeq) identify 34, S4, 127, 377 and 334 DE genes, respectively, at 5% FDR.
Panel (e) shows box plots of each gene’s 75th percentile of expression for the three groups of genes deﬁned in panel (0). Panel (1') shows the CDF of the
75th percentile of expression among the 34, S4, 127, 377 and 334 DE genes identiﬁed by each method

genes identiﬁed exclusively by edgeR having highest Dixon’s
Q—statistic. Many of the genes appear to be EE with a single
outlier, and all of them have very low counts. Figure 4e shows
the box plots of each gene’s 75th percentile of expression in the
groups of 114, 161 and 197 genes. The genes identified exclu-
sively by edgeR have lower expression on average than the other
groups while the genes identiﬁed exclusively by EBSeq tend to be
highly expressed. Figure 4f shows the CDFs of each gene’s 75th
percentile of expression in the groups identified by each of the
ﬁve methods. Approximately 20% of the genes identiﬁed by
edgeR are with 75th percentile of expression <20.

Results from the gene and isoform comparisons between
EBSeq and Cuffdiff2 Via Cufﬁinks-processed data are also con-
sistent with the simulation study, with Cuffdiff2 identifying far
fewer genes and isoforms than EBSeq. Speciﬁcally, Cuffdiff2
identiﬁes seven isoforms, each of which is identiﬁed by EBSeq,
but EBSeq also finds additional isoforms to be DE (935 in total).
Furthermore, in this case study, isoform-level results obtained
from EBSeq are more consistent with gene-level results than
those obtained from Cuffdiff2. Specifically, there are 12404
single-isoform genes. For these, we expect isoform and gene-level
inference to match (i.e. if the isoform is DE, the gene should also
be DE, given there is only a single isoform in that gene). Of the
54 genes identiﬁed as DE by Cuffdiff2, 39 have single isoforms;
only 5 of the 39 are also identiﬁed as DE isoforms by Cuffdiff2.
Of the 351 genes identified as DE by EBSeq, 226 have single
isoforms and 225 of the 226 are also called DE at the isoform
level by EBSeq. Furthermore, many important genes conﬁrmed
to be DE between ESCs and iPSCs in previous studies (Bock
et al., 2011; Ohi et al., 2011; Phanstiel et al., 2011) are missed by
Cuffdiff2 but not EBSeq, including DPP6, FAMI9A5, SOXI7
and DNAJCI5.

4 CONCLUSIONS

The main difference between EBSeq and the other approaches
considered here is that EBSeq models isoform expression dir-
ectly, as opposed to gene expression, and in so doing accommo-
dates isoform expression-estimation uncertainty. In particular,
estimation uncertainty is partitioned into three groups deﬁned
by isoform complexity (1g 2 1, 2, or 3), following our empirical
observation that uncertainty is increased on average in isoforms
that share a parent gene. EBSeq is not restricted to three groups,
and for some genomes, additional Ig groups may be warranted.
EBSeq is also not restricted to this deﬁnition of complexity (see
Implementation below). EBSeq shows increased power over
Cuffdiff2 for identifying DE isoforms. Although developed to
facilitate isoform inference, like Cuffdiff2, EBSeq may also be
used for identifying DE genes. It shows slightly increased power
over most count-based methods in both simulation and case
studies, without major losses in efﬁciency when outliers are
present.

A second difference is that, unlike most approaches that clas-
sify non-DE genes as EE, EBSeq is based on a parametric
mixture model, which facilitates evaluation of the posterior prob-
abilities associated with DE, as well as EE. The particular par-
ameterization provides closed form predictive distributions that
facilitate efficient computation. However, diagnostics should
always be checked to ensure model fit (see Section 7 of the

Supplementary Material). Once posterior probabilities are
obtained from a well-ﬁt model, a user may identify an FDR-
controlled list of EE genes. This may be of particular interest
for genes with more than one isoform, as compensatory mech-
anisms may give rise to DE isoforms in EE genes, and conse-
quently subtle, yet important, differences may be missed if
focus is placed exclusively on DE genes alone. Using the EE
posterior probabilities from the case study, EBSeq identiﬁed 64
EE genes, with DE isoforms contributing at least 30% of the
gene expression (20 are shown in Supplementary Fig. S13).
The mixture model framework also enables comparisons of
more than two biological conditions (see Section 6 of the
Supplementary Material).

5 IMPLEMENTATION

EBSeq is implemented as an R package (R Development Core
Team, 2009), currently available at http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/
~kendzior/EBSEQ/ and soon to be available on Galaxy. EBSeq
requires estimates of isoform expression, estimates of gene ex-
pression, or gene counts, but it is not speciﬁc to any particular
estimation method.

For users that prefer RSEM (Li et al., 2010) for expression
estimation, an EBSeq-RSEM pipeline has been developed so that
a user may easily apply RSEM to quantify expression and then
EBSeq to identify DE genes and isoforms. For well annotated
genomes, where isoforms and their corresponding parent genes
are well deﬁned, a user may choose to quantify isoform com-
plexity using three groups deﬁned by lg, as we have done here.
For genomes that are not well annotated (e. g. for de novo
assembled transcriptomes), a user could use another measure
of isoform complexity. The RSEM-EBSeq pipeline takes reads’
unmappability scores and applies a K-means algorithm to cluster
the isoforms into K uncertainty groups; the number of groups
(K) defaults to 3. The unmappability scores are also provided as
output and, consequently, a user could easily apply a K-means
algorithm with different values of K or apply another clustering
algorithm to deﬁne the uncertainty groups. Extensions that allow
for continuous covariates and accommodate ordered conditions
(e. g. time course data) are underway.

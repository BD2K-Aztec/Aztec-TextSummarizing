Abstract

Motivation: Functional interpretation of miRNA expression data is currently done in a three step
procedure: select differentially expressed miRNAs, find their target genes, and carry out gene set
overrepresentation analysis. Nevertheless, major limitations of this approach have already been
described at the gene level, while some newer arise in the miRNA scenario.

Here, we propose an enhanced methodology that builds on the well—established gene set analysis
paradigm. Evidence for differential expression at the miRNA level is transferred to a gene differen—
tial inhibition score which is easily interpretable in terms of gene sets or pathways. Such trans—
ferred indexes account for the additive effect of several miRNAs targeting the same gene, and also
incorporate cancellation effects between cases and controls. Together, these two desirable charac—
teristics allow for more accurate modeling of regulatory processes.

Results: We analyze high—throughput sequencing data from 20 different cancer types and provide
exhaustive reports of gene and Gene Ontology—term deregulation by miRNA action.

Availability and Implementation: The proposed methodology was implemented in the
Bioconductor library mdgsa. http://bioconductor.0rg/packages/mdgsa. For the purpose of reprodu—

1 Introduction

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules which
participate in post-transcriptional gene regulation (He and Hannon,
2004). They bind to target mRNAs with partial complementarity,
causing translational repression or target degradation (Wei et (11.,
2013). Aberrant miRNAs expression has been reported to be linked
to disease (Jiang et (11., 2009) and so many genomic experiments are
now being conducted with the aim of clarifying the relationship be-
tween miRNA levels and phenotype. These experiments generally
use microarrays or high-throughput sequencing to record miRNA
expression between different biological conditions, followed by
differential-expression analysis to evaluate the association of each

miRNA to phenotype. It is common in such analyses to first select
the significantly different miRNAs, and then explore their target
genes to infer possible functional consequences of the deregulation of
these miRNAs. Gene function databases, such as the Gene Ontology
(GO) (Ashburner et (11., 2000), KEGG (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000) or
Reactome (Joshi—Tope et (11., 2005) are commonly used in this second
step. Some authors prefer to first annotate miRNAs onto the func-
tions of their target genes, and then do the functional interpretation
at the miRNA level (Bleazard et (11., 2015; Godard and van Eyll,
2015). Despite being less instinctive or intuitive, this approach has
been shown to reduce the effect of biased database information. This
two-step paradigm, known as over representation analysis (ORA),

has been extensively used in gene expression experiments and is
now, the exclusive method used for miRNA functional profiling.

But even in the gene expression context, ORA approaches have
been legitimately criticized and some major drawbacks have been
described (Dopazo, 2009; Khatri et al., 2012). Most concerning of
these disadvantages is the loss of information caused by using only
a few genes and the egalitarian treatment of these selected genes, a
problem that arises again in the miRNA scenario. In differential
gene—expression analyses for instance, ORA only considers genes
which show large expression differences, whereas small changes in
functionally related gene sets may be more relevant to the underly—
ing biology. Similar biases occur when analyzing miRNA expres—
sion data, but in this case the effect is doubled. On one hand, some
genes may be regulated by a big change in a single miRNA. If this
occurs in an experiment, the miRNA will be identified as differen—
tially expressed and therefore ORA can be used, with the above
mentioned limitations. On the other hand, some other less—robust
gene deregulations may go unnoticed because the miRNAs causing
them do not appear among the most differentially expressed candi—
dates, thus, in such cases the combined gene set effect will be
missed. Furthermore, genes can also be inhibited by the additive
effect of several small miRNA changes (Doxakis, 2010;
Papapetrou et al., 2010). This scenario is common but is usually
neglected in the ORA because the causative miRNAs are unlikely
to be selected in the two—stages approach. Finally, a gene may be
regulated by several miRNAs with opposite expression patterns
(BleazaId et al., 2015). This may induce compensatory effects that,
presumably, are not considered by ORA approaches. As a simple
example of this later situation we can think about a gene modu—
lated by two miRNAs, one of them up regulated in experimental
cases and the other up regulated in controls. The gene will be
down regulated or inhibited in both conditions and hence, is irrele—
vant for case—control comparison. Despite this, ORA algorithms
are likely to identify such genes as relevant in the comparison, be—
cause their regulatory miRNAs will have been selected in the
differential—expression step of the analysis (Godard and van Eyll,
2015 ).

Thus, the application ORA methodology intrinsically implies a
relatively naive understanding of biology. In the context of gene ex—
pression, the limitations of ORA have already been surpassed by
gene set analysis (GSA) methods (Mootha et al., 2003). GSA
approaches which can successfully model the importance of weaker,
but coordinated changes in sets of functionally related genes, there—
fore reinforcing genomic data interpretation. But, even though GSA
methods have been available for a long time for gene—based experi—
ments, to our knowledge, no GSA—like methodologies have so far
been proposed for functional profiling of miRNA measurements.
This lack of GSA—style applications to miRNA data is not really sur—
prising for two reasons: first, functional annotation is normally at—
tached to genes, thus, in order to interpret miRNA data (for instance
in terms of GO or KEGG), scientists must first define how miRNA
and database information should be linked. For this purpose, mean—
ingful miRNA—to—gene transfer of the experimental evidence is im—
plicitly necessary. Second, most GSA algorithms are such that the
gene—level analysis and the enrichment steps are strongly inter—
dependent and cannot easily be split up. Such lack of flexibility of
most GSA algorithms hinders their re—implementation and usage in
the miRNA context.

For instance in the classical GSEA algorithm (Subramanian
et al., 2005), the statistical significance of the enrichment is eval—
uated using a phenotype—based permutation applied to the gene—
expression data matrix. Thus, the differential—expression step is

carried out within the re—sampling schema, and cannot be changed
without rewriting the algorithm.

In this paper, we propose a novel GSA—type methodology for
functionally interpreting miRNA expression data. Taking advantage
of the additive inhibitor effect that miRNAs may have on genes, we
first propose a meaningful procedure for transferring miRNA differ—
ential expression evidence to the gene level via a differential inhih-
ition score. Then we use logistic regression models (Montaner and
Dopazo, 2010; Montaner et al., 2009; Sartor et al., 2009) to inter—
pret this gene inhibition information in terms of gene sets.

To exemplify the applicability of our method here we analyze 20
different real datasets taken from The Cancer Genome Atlas project
(McLendon et al., 2008). Tumor samples are compared to normal
tissue in a differential miRNA expression analysis and then, func—
tional profiling in terms of GO is carried out for each of them.
Several GO terms already known to be cancer related appear as
deregulated in the different cancers, validating the suitability of our
approach. We hope our algorithm, implemented in the R/
Bioconductor package mdgsa (Montaner and Dopazo, 2010), will
be useful to data analysts, but also that the extensive supplementary
materials presented in this paper would constitute a valuable asset.

2 Materials and methods

At the time of writing this paper 32 datasets were registered in the The
Cancer Genome Atlas project. We downloaded and analyzed 20 of
these: those with miRNA expression information, measured using
Illumina HiSeq technology (Bentley et al., 2008), which contain both
tumoral and healthy samples. Table 1 shows the reference for the down—
loaded datasets and the number of samples included in each analysis.

Preprocessed miRNA expression—count matrices were down—
loaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas data portal https://tcga—
data.nci.nih.gov/tcga. Differential expression analysis, comparing
primary tumor samples to solid normal tissue, was carried out using
an unpaired approach for all 20 datasets. In addition, we also per—
formed a paired analysis for 17 of them: the datasets containing
tumoral and normal samples from the same individual. These
miRNA—level analyses were done using the Bioconductor
(Gentleman et al., 2004) library edgeR (Robinson et al., 2010).

Thus, for each comparison, P—values and test statistics were ob—
tained at the miRNA level. The p—value represents the strength of the
differential miRNA expression between cases and controls, while the
sign of the statistic indicates the sense, or ‘direction’, of that differ—
ence; in our case, positive statistic values indicate overexpression in
cases compared to controls, and negative statistic values indicate
underexpression. For each miRNA, these two quantities can be com—
bined in a unique index, accounting for the strength and sense of the
differential expression using the following transformation:

r : —sign(statistic) - log(P—value) (1)

The computed values r are comparable across different miRNAs
as they represent the original P—values. In addition, r also retains the
sign of the test statistic, preserving the information about the ‘direc—
tion’ of the overexpression. It is therefore an index that ranks the
miRNAs according to their expression—level differences; from those
which are more overexpressed in cases, (the ones with the highest
positive values), to those which are more underexpressed in cases,
(indexes which are more negative). According to the definition,
miRNAs with an r index value close to zero are those with similar
expression levels in both cases and controls, that is, the ones that are
not differentially expressed. In this case we derived our r values

case, a large number of miRNAs are expected to be differentially ex—
pressed, but we can easily imagine an experiment resulting in very
few or even no differentially expressed miRNAs due, for instance, to
sample size restrictions. In such cases ORA methodologies are not

applicable but gene set analysis style methods, like the one presented
here, might allow researchers to extract some meaningful conclu—
sions from the data.

3.2 Gene level

After miRNA differential expression analysis, Equation 1 was used
to summarize the P—values and sign statistics into a single ranking
statistic. Then, Equation 2 was applied to translate this miRNA dif—
ferential expression evidence into a gene differential inhibition scale.
For each gene, this transferred index condenses the information
about the miRNAs which target it, preserving two characteristics
suitable for the functional interpretation of the experiment: it ac—
counts for the multiple miRNA cancellation effect and it incorpor—
ates the additive effect of several small inhibitory events.

For example the GPR162 gene is targeted by two miRNAs: hsa-
miR-22-3p and hsa-miR-214-3p. In paired analysis of kidney chro-
mophobe (KIRCH) carcinoma, overexpression of hsa-miR-22-3p
was reported in tumor samples (with a P—value of 5.6 X 10—30) while
hsa-miR-214-3p was underexpressed (with a confidence level of
1.8 X 10—29). Over expression indexes derived using Equation 1
Where 67.34 for hsa-miR-22-3p and —66.61 for hsa-miR-214-3p,
indicating that there is evidence for very similar differential expres—
sion of these two miRNAs, but in opposite ‘directions’. Hence, the
gene GPR162 must be inhibited in cases by miRNA hsa-miR-22-3p
with the same strength that it is inhibited in controls by miRNA hsa-
miR-214-3p. Therefore, our interpretation is that, both inhibition
effects cancel each other out and so, gene GPR162 is considered to
be irrelevant to the cancer process in terms of miRNA action. This
cancellation is reflected in the gene transferred index computed with
Equation 2 which yields a negligible differential inhibition score of
0.73 for this gene. Moreover, when using the logistic regression
model indicated in Equation 3 to perform a gene set analysis of the
gene transferred index, gene GPR162 will not support the enrich—
ment of any of the functions in which it is involved.

The cumulative effect of several weaker miRNA differential—
expression events can also be appreciated, for instance, in the results
produced for the cancer growth regulator gene GREB 1. This gene is
targeted by 16 miRNAs none of which has an absolute differential
inhibition score higher than 10 in the analysis of the esophageal car-
cinoma (ESCA) dataset. Nevertheless, adding up all 16 values, we
computed a differential inhibition score of — 53.65 for the gene,
indicating strong inhibition in normal samples compared to tumors.
We concluded that GREBI is usually regulated in normal tissues by
the combined action of many miRNAs, and that this regulation is
lost in ESCA tumors, which therefore may affect cancer growth.
Regarding the gene set analysis, GREBI will support the GO terms
to which it belongs as being inhibited by miRNA action in controls
or, equivalently, as deregulated in cases.

3.3 Gene set level

Once the miRNA differential—expression evidence is transferred to
the genes, the differential inhibition ranking index can be easily ana—
lyzed in terms of gene sets using a logistic regression approach
(Montaner and Dopazo, 2010; Montaner et al., 2009; Sartor et al.,
2009).

Table 5 shows the number GO terms enriched in positive and
negative transferred index values. In our analysis, the positive trans—
ferred index values belong to genes whose targeting miRNAs are
overexpressed in cancer. These genes are generally more inhibited in
tumor samples due to the effect of miRNAs. Therefore, GO terms
enriched in the positive transferred index gene values represent

biological functions which are globally more inhibited, or inter—
cepted, by the miRNA effect in cases than in controls. Similarly, GO
terms enriched in negative transferred index gene values represent
those which have higher interception rates in control samples than
in tumor samples. The biological interpretation of this second group
of functions is that ordinarily they are controlled by miRNA action
in normal tissue and that this coordination is lost in affected tissue,
causing deregulation of the function in a cancer state. Hence, in this
paper we refer to the GO terms enriched in positive transferred
index values as inhibited or intercepted in cancer cells, and we term
gene sets enriched in negative transferred index values deregulated
in cancer states. Figure 2 outlines and summarizes the key param—
eters and steps in our methodology.

Overall, the GO inhibition or deregulation patterns found in the
paired and unpaired analyses are strongly positively correlated (see
Supplementary Materials), reflecting the consistency of our ap—
proach. Despite this, the number of GO terms enriched in the paired
and unpaired analyses differ, which may reflect inter—individual vari—
ability in the role that miRNAs play in cancer. No association pat—
tern between GO size (number of genes in the block) and
significance levels was found (see Supplementary Materials), indicat—
ing the method’s lack of bias in this respect.

Not many enriched GO terms are shared across cancer types (see
Supplementary Materials). This is expected due to the great number
of differences in the tissues, both normal and tumoral, collected in
the different experiments held in The Cancer Genome Atlas. But
may also reflect the specific roles miRNAs play in cancer develop—
ment. Most of the enriched terms shared across different cancer
types are related to cell development, widely known to be related to
cancer evolution. On the other hand, the majority of GO terms
which are individually enriched in the different specific cancer types

are related to cell development, adhesion, signaling and prolifer-
ation; all of them major processes associated with cancer.

For instance, in our paired analysis, the endoplasmic reticulum
lumen cellular component (GO:0005788) is deregulated in BLCA,
CESC and UCEC, all closely related urogenital carcinomas. Full
gene set profiling of the paired an unpaired datasets for 5169 GO
terms can be found in our Supplementary Materials. It includes com—
parisons between paired and unpaired subsets and a clustering ana—
lysis of the different cancer types, based on GSA results.

In order to estimate type 1 errors, all the analyses where repeated
after random permutation of the gene column in the miRNA targets
database. This re—sampling procedure preserves the number of genes
each miRNA targets and the GO annotations, but removes all biolo—
gical associations within, and between miRNAs. In these permuta—
tion experiments the proportion of significant GO terms remained
well below the expected 5% (see Supplementary Materials).

Following the (Godard and van Eyll, 2015) paradigm, logistic re—
gression analysis was also carried out directly at the miRNA level.
This can trivially be done using the mdgsa library after the annota—
tion is extrapolated from genes to miRNAs. Functional results at the
miRNA and gene level showed a significant positive correlation (see
Supplementary Materials).

In order to illustrate how the functional profiling can be re—
stricted to just the expressed genes if such information is available,
we downloaded gene expression measurements for the KICH dataset
and repeated the analysis modifying Equation 2 as indicated in the
methods section. As expected, a significantly positive but not too
strong correlation was found between the results with and without
accounting for the expressed genes. Details of the analysis and re—
sults are available in the Supplementary Materials.

4 Conclusions

We have introduced a novel approach to the functional interpret—
ation of miRNA studies which is primarily designed to unravel the
effects of differential miRNA expression on groups of genes or
pathways.

Our proposal relies on the gene set analysis paradigm which ex—
tends currently used over representation methodologies. It constitutes
a general framework applicable in most genomic scenarios, even
when no (or too many) miRNAs are differentially expressed, hence,
this algorithm eradicates the arbitrariness of current ‘ad hoc’ proced—
ures. But more importantly, our algorithm can encompass biologically
relevant events which are neglected by others, representing a step for—
ward in miRNA gene—regulation modeling. First, our approach ac—
counts for cancellation effects that arise when a gene is intercepted by
different sets of miRNAs within each biological condition. Second, it
is able to incorporate the additive effect caused when several weak
miRNA inhibitors exert their influence on the same gene.

These major advantages are possible thanks to a key innovative
idea introduced in this paper: that differential miRNA expression
can be meaningfully transferred to the gene level as a differential in-
hibition score.

If miRNA—to—gene transfer comprises cancellation and summa—
tion effects, the gene set methodology performs the same role at the
functional level. A GO term is considered not to be enriched, or can-
celed, if half of its genes are inhibited in cases and the other half in
controls. But also the additive effect consideration reappears at
pathway level: many weakly deregulated, or inhibited, genes which
would be inconsequential in isolation become relevant if they are
systematically annotated under the same biological function.

Besides the analysis presented here, the logistic regression meth—
odology developed in our previous work allows the algorithm to be
extended in many convenient ways. For example, the relative im—
portance of miRNAs, genes, or the miRNA—gene relationship can be
easily weighted for at the transference step or when fitting the logis—
tic model. Thus, confidence about the miRNA targets, number of
target sites in genes, absolute gene expression levels, or even natural
miRNA functional loss (Carbonell et al., 2012), can be directly ac—
counted for using our model. Furthermore, additional genomic in—
formation can be incorporated using our multidimensional
framework: for instance, joint GSA analysis of miRNA regulation
and gene expression is straightforward once the transference prob—
lem is solved using the methodology we explain in this paper. Also
the flexibility of our approach and software makes its use independ—
ent of the differential—expression algorithm used at the miRNA level.
Different statistical tests or even fold changes can substitute the
edgeR method used here; similarly, any miRNA target databases
can be used.

We have illustrated our novel methodology using an extensive
collection of cancer datasets, but here we just present some deregu—
lated genes or functions as a proof of concept. Complete results are
available in the supplementary data. We hope that the ideas intro—
duced here can easily be extrapolated to other gene regulatory proc—
esses such as those involving transcription factors for instance.

Finally, it is crucial to highlight the importance of data normal—
ization for the correct functional interpretation of NGS studies.
Inadequate data preprocessing may affect P—values for differential
miRNA expression and even the sign of test statistics, sequentially
affecting Equations 1—3 and therefore changing the results of our
methodology. Thus, thorough data preparation and exploration
should always be conducted before using our algorithm.

Abstract

Motivation: How chromatin folds in three—dimensional (3D) space is closely related to transcription
regulation. As powerful tools to study such 3D chromatin conformation, the recently developed
Hi—C technologies enable a genome—wide measurement of pair—wise chromatin interaction.
However, methods for the detection of biologically meaningful chromatin interactions, i.e. peak
calling, from Hi—C data, are still under development. In our previous work, we have developed a
novel hidden Markov random field (HMRF) based Bayesian method, which through explicitly mod—
eling the non—negligible spatial dependency among adjacent pairs of loci manifesting in high reso—
lution Hi—C data, achieves substantially improved robustness and enhanced statistical power in
peak calling. Superior to peak callers that ignore spatial dependency both methodologically and in
performance, our previous Bayesian framework suffers from heavy computational costs due to in—
tensive computation incurred by modeling the correlated peak status of neighboring loci pairs and
the inference of hidden dependency structure.

Results: In this work, we have developed FastHiC, a novel approach based on simulated field ap—
proximation, which approximates the joint distribution of the hidden peak status by a set of inde—
pendent random variables, leading to more tractable computation. Performance comparisons in
real data analysis showed that FastHiC not only speeds up our original Bayesian method by more
than five times, bus also achieves higher peak calling accuracy.

chromatin interaction (Lieberman—Aiden et 111., 2009). In the Hi—C
data, the contact frequency between any two chromatin loci is meas—
ured by the number of paired—end reads spanning across them.
Higher read count indicates more frequent chromatin interaction
and closer spatial proximity.

The rapid accumulation of Hi—C data with high sequencing
depth enables the study of chromatin interaction at the unprece—
dented resolution (Jin et 111., 2013; Rao et 111., 2014). However, the
detection of biologically meaningful long—range chromatin inter—
actions poses great challenges. Most existing methods (Ay et 111.,
2014; Jin et 111., 2013; Rao et 111., 2014) assume that the chromatin
interaction frequencies for different loci pairs are independent,
which is clearly invalid. If two loci show high interaction frequency,
their adjacent loci will be more likely to interact with each other. To
fill in this gap, we have recently developed a novel hidden Markov
random field based Bayesian (HMRFBayes) method to explicitly
model the spatial dependency among adjacent loci (Xu et 111., 2016).
By borrowing information across neighborhood loci, HMRF
achieves substantially improved robustness and enhanced statistical
power.

While extremely promising, HMRFBayes is based on a Bayesian
framework which requires intensive computation. The key challenge
is to efficiently and effectively infer the dependency structure under—
lying the hidden peak status. To address this challenge, we de—
veloped a novel algorithm named FastHiC, which approximates the
joint distribution of the hidden peak status by a set of independent
random variables. Under such approximation, we adopted an EM
algorithm for statistical inference. Compared with HMRFBayes,
FastHiC not only speeds up by more than five times, but also
achieves higher peak calling accuracy.

2 Statistical model

We use the same HMRF model as in our previous work (Xu et 111.,
2016). Our goal is to detect biologically meaningful chromatin inter—
actions among N loci. Let xii and eii represent the observed and ex—
pected chromatin contact frequency between loci i and /,
respectively (1 S i < j S N Here, eii is known based on the pre—
specified background model (Ay et 111., 2014; Jin et 111., 2013). Let zii
be the hidden peak status: zii : 1 indicates a biologically meaningful
interaction, while zii : —1 indicates a random collision. We further
assume that xi,- follows a negative binomial distribution with mean
eii exp{0(z,-,- + 1) /2} and over—dispersion </>. Here, exp{0} is the
signal—noise—ratio of the peak over the background. In the HMRF
model, we assume that xii’s are conditionally independent given the
hidden peak status zii, where zii follows an Ising distribution (Besag,
1974):

p({z,-,-}11/):W: wexp ,1, Z W,

Ii-i’ I+Ii-i’ I:1

 

Here, 1/1 is the parameter accounting for spatial dependency. Larger
1/1 indicates higher spatial dependency. W(1/1) is the normalization
constant without explicit expression form.

The key challenge is the efficient and effective inference of
the spatial dependency parameter 1/1. In our previous work (Xu
et 111., 2016), we used the pseudo—likelihood (PL) to approximate the
Ising distribution, and devised a Gibbs sampler for statistical
inference.

PL({zi,-}I11): H p(z.-,-Izw.1i—i’1+I/—/’I:1.11).

lgi<jgN

However, in the PL approximation, the neighborhood of each
loci pair can still ﬂuctuate, resulting in intractable computation of
1/1. To solve this problem, we developed a novel algorithm named
FastHiC, which uses the simulated field mi,- : E(z,-,-jz,-II-I , )1 — 1J)+
j/ — f) : 1) to approximate the joint distribution of the peak status
implicated by the Ising distribution (Celeux et 111., 2003), leading to
a modified pseudo—likelihood (MPL):

MPL({zi,-}I11): H p(zi,-Imw.1i—i’1+I/—/’I:1. 11>.

lgi<jgN

This MPL approximates the Ising distribution by a set of inde—
pendent random variables, enabling tractable computation of 1/1.
FastHiC then adopts an EM algorithm for inference. Details of the
simulated field approximation and EM algorithm can be found in
Supplementary Material Section S1.

3 Results

We first conducted simulation study to compare the performance of
FastHiC with HMRFBayes (Supplementary Material Section S2).
These two methods achieved comparable statistical efficiency in par—
ameter estimations (Supplementary Table S1) and peak calling ac—
curacy (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Table S2). Noticeably, FastHiC
ran more than five times faster than HMRFBayes (Supplementary
Table S3), due to the novel implementation of simulated field
approximation.

Next, we re—analyzed the Hi—C data in human IMR90 cells (Jin
et 111., 2013) where 2262 topological associated domains (TADs) were
identified (Dixon et 111., 2012). We analyzed each TAD separately to
detect intra—TAD chromatin interactions at 4Kb resolution. We
didnot analyze inter—TAD chromatin interactions because low
sequencing depth for inter—TAD reads (the average number of intra—
TAD and inter—TAD reads are 58.91 and 1.57, respectively). Since we
have shown that HMRFBayes (Xu et 111., 2016) outperforms AFC (Jin
et 111., 2013) and Fit—Hi—C (Ay et 111., 2014), in this work, we only
compared the performance of FastHiC and HMRFBayes
(Supplementary Table S4). We did not compare with HiCCUPS (Rao
et 111., 2014) since its software is not publicly available. Overall,
FastHiC and HMRFBayes obtained highly similar peak calling re—
sults. The Spearman correlation coefficient of peak probabilities be—
tween FastHiC and HMRFBayes within each TAD has median 0.934
and standard deviation 0.121. In addition, we compared the peak
calling results from FastHiC and HMRFBayes with the chromatin
loops identified from the in situ Hi—C data (Rao et 111., 2014). Figure
1A shows that peaks identified by FastHiC have slightly higher over—
lap with chromatin loops than peaks identified by HMRFBayes.
Overall, FastHiC and HMRFBayes achieved highly similar peak call—
ing accuracy in real Hi—C data in human IMR90 cells.

Next, we compared the computational time of four different
peak callers with different TAD sizes (Fig. 1B). In general, the run—
ning time increases quadratically with the TAD size. For all 2262
TADs, the average running time for FastHiC, HMRFBayes, AFC
and Fit—Hi—C are 428, 4134, 2605 and 195, respectively. FastHiC
runs much faster than HMRFBayes and AFC. Although Fit—Hi—C
runs faster than FastHiC, we have showed that the HMRF—based ap—
proach outperformed Fit—Hi—C in peak calling accuracy (Xu et 111.,
2016). Compared with Fit—Hi—C, we believe that FastHiC achieves a
reasonable balance between speed and accuracy.

To further compare the performance of FastHiC and
HMRFBayes, we analyzed two additional Hi—C datasets in human
H1 embryonic stem cells (Dixon et 111., 2015) and human GM12878

lymphoblastic cells (Selvaraj et 111., 2013). We detected intra—TAD
chromatin interactions at 40 kb resolution. To evaluate peak calling
accuracy, we compared the peak calling results from FastHiC and
HMRFBayes with the recently published ChIA—PET data on H1 (Ji
et 111., 2015) and GM12878 cells (Tang et 111., 2015). We found that
peaks identified from FastHiC show much higher overlap with chro—
matin loops detected from ChIA—PET data than those identified
from HMRFBayes, in both H1 (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. S2)
and GM12878 cells (Fig. 1D). These results demonstrate that
FastHiC achieves higher peak calling accuracy than HMRFBayes.

In addition, we explored modeling the dependency structure
with broader neighborhood, but neither simulation studies nor real
data analysis showed performance improvement (Supplementary
Material Section S4).

4 Conclusion

In summary, we have developed FastHiC, a fast and accurate algorithm
to detect long—range chromatin interactions from Hi—C data. FastHiC
utilized the same hidden Markov random field model as in our previous
work (Xu et 111., 2016), but with a novel implementation of the simu—
lated field approximation, leading to more than five times speed—up and
higher peak calling accuracy. We believe that FastHiC has potential to
become a useful tool in studying chromatin spatial organization.

Fig. 2. Estimates of k, and [Q from RelateAdmix, REAP and Plink, respectively. The true value of (khkz) is (0,0) for unrelated pairs, (1,0) for parent-
offspring, (05,025) for full siblings, (0.5,0) for half siblings, (0.25,0) for ﬁrst cousins and (0.0625,0) for second cousins

Assuming independence between loci we write the likelihood as

M
19(G1,G2|R,Q1, Q) = Hp(G},G§|R,Q1,Q2)
[:1

M
= H 2 2pm}, Gflzi = (21,22),A,- = a)
[:1

p(A,- = alzi = (21, 22), Q1, Q2)p(Z,- = (21.22%)

where for each locus 21 indicates whether allele 1 in indl and ind2 are
IBD, 22 indicates whether allele 2 in indl and ind2 are IBD and
a: (al,a§,a§,a§) represents the unobserved ancestral populations of
the two individuals’ two alleles, see Figure 1. Note that for convenience,
we have restricted the IBD sharing patterns in the sense that allele 1 of
indl can only be IBD with allele 1 of ind2, and allele 2 of indl can only be
IBD with allele 2 of ind2. Because we sum over all values of a and we do
not ﬁx the allelic values of the speciﬁc alleles, this leads to the same
likelihood as if we had not restricted the IBD sharing patterns. The
three terms in the aforementioned likelihood are given in the supplemen-
tary data. The ML solution is found using an Expectation-Maximization
algorithm (see Supplementary Data) which is accelerated using the
squared iterative method S3 (V aradhan and Roland, 2008).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

To assess RelateAdmix, we simulated data and applied the tools
RelateAdmix, REAP, KING and Plink. Using allele frequencies
from 104 290 single nucleotide polymorphisms from a HapMap
phase 3 European and African population, we simulated 1600
individuals with different relationships and varying degree of
admixture (see Supplementary Data for details). We then used
the software Admixture (Alexander et al., 2009) to estimate ad—
mixture proportions for all the individuals and allele frequencies
for the two populations and used these estimates and the genetic
data as input to RelateAdmix and REAP. For Plink and KING,
we only used the genetic data as input. Finally, we used
RelateAdmix, REAP and Plink to estimate R between all pairs
of individuals, in total 1279 200 pairs, see Figure 2. Additional

plots of the kinship coefﬁcient, also including a plot for KING,
which provides estimates of the kinship coefﬁcient but not R, are
shown in the Supplementary Material. The results show that
based on R all the methods can identify the closely related indi—
viduals, but that Plink and REAP have problems separating the
unrelated individuals from the more distantly related individuals.
Based on the kinship estimates both REAP and RelateAdmix
can distinguish all relationships, whereas Plink and KING still
have problems. The results also show that RelateAdmix gives
more accurate R estimates for all relationships.

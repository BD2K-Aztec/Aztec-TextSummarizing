Abstract

Motivation: The majority of variation identified by genome wide association studies falls in non—
coding genomic regions and is hypothesized to impact regulatory elements that modulate gene ex—
pression. Here we present a statistically rigorous software tool GREGOR (Genomic Regulatory
Elements and Gwas Overlap algoRithm) for evaluating enrichment of any set of genetic variants
with any set of regulatory features. Using variants from five phenotypes, we describe a data—driven
approach to determine the tissue and cell types most relevant to a trait of interest and to identify
the subset of regulatory features likely impacted by these variants. Last, we experimentally evalu—
ate six predicted functional variants at six lipid—associated loci and demonstrate significant evi—
dence for allele—specific impact on expression levels. GREGOR systematically evaluates enrichment
of genetic variation with the vast collection of regulatory data available to explore novel biological
mechanisms of disease and guide us toward the functional variant at trait—associated loci.

Availability and implementation: GREGOR, including source code, documentation, examples, and

executables, is available at http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/GREGOR.

1 Introduction

The list of common genetic variants associated with complex disease
continues to grow as a result of increasingly powered genome wide
association studies (GWAS) (Welter et (11., 2014). A large proportion
of the associated variants are non—coding and it has proven difficult
to identify the functional variant at loci with many variants in tight
linkage disequilibrium (LD). In addition, these loci often account for
only a small percentage of the trait heritability which makes any
minor alteration of transcript levels difficult to detect. Although
eQTLs in relevant tissues can highlight loci where variants likely im—
pact transcription of nearby genes, fine—mapping of the causal vari—
ant is plagued by the same LD patterns that impact disease

association studies. Common variation located outside of protein—
coding regions modulates regulatory elements in a cell—type specific
manner (Claussnitzer et (11., 2014; Ernst et (11., 2011; Kichaev et (11.,
2014; Lo et (11., 2014; Maurano et (11., 2012; Parker et (11., 2013;
Pickrell, 2014; Thurman et (11., 2012; Trynka et (11., 2013).
Examining disease—associated variants in relation to genomic regions
of functional importance can give insight into the molecular mech—
anisms leading to disease phenotypes, particularly when all associ—
ated variants are considered in aggregate.

Our understanding of the location of regulatory elements in the
genome has expanded with the advent of chromatin immunoprecipi—
tation followed by high—throughput DNA sequencing (ChIP—Seq)

technology and the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE)
Project (The ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012). However, it is
challenging to untangle meaningful biological understanding in a
systematic manner, given the diverse set of data available from hun—
dreds of cell types and tissues. With the notion that non—coding gen—
etic variation plays a role in transcriptional regulation via regulatory
epigenomic features, we can harness these data to gain knowledge of
important biological mechanisms. For example, genetic variation
that impacts local chromatin or methylation states and DNA acces—
sibility can impact transcription in a given cell. In a majority of asso—
ciated genomic regions, the SNP supported by ENCODE data is a
SNP in strong LD with the top reported GWAS SNP (Schaub et al.,
2012). Systematic chromatin profiling has revealed that variants
linked with the GWAS index variant, defined here as the most
strongly associated variant, are often positioned within enhancer
elements active in relevant cell types (Ernst et al., 2011).
Furthermore, the overlap of particular histone methylation marks
with trait associated variants is cell type—specific, suggesting that
gene regulation is inﬂuenced by trait alleles in a cell type—specific
manner (Trynka et al., 2013). Previous work has used chromatin
profiles and other ChIP—seq experimental data to investigate GWAS
variation and predict the impact of candidate variants in particular
genomic regions (Boyle et al., 2012; Claussnitzer et al., 2014;
Kichaev et al., 2014; Lo et al., 2014; Maurano et al., 2012; Pickrell
2014; Thurman et al., 2012; Ward and Kellis 2012). However, these
methods often do not consider an appropriate control set for evalu—
ating enrichment and do not always carefully evaluate the most rele—
vant tissues or cell types for enrichment of trait—specific variation.
Identifying causal variants and mechanisms at GWAS loci remains a
universal scientific challenge.

With this motivation, we developed a statistically rigorous ap—
proach to quantify enrichment of trait—associated variants in experi—
mentally annotated functional elements such as open chromatin
states, histone marks and protein—binding sites in relevant cell types
to develop a clearer understanding of the underlying regulatory
mechanisms. We apply an algorithm and systematic scientific
method for prioritizing functional candidate variants at genome—
wide significant trait—associated loci. Our aims are threefold: (i) to
elucidate the important tissue/cell types in which genetic variation
impacts transcription for a particular trait, (ii) to narrow our focus
of the regulatory features underlying transcription disrupted by
trait—associated variants and (iii) to use positional overlap with se—
lected regulatory domains to identify potential functional candidates
at trait—associated loci. To address these aims, we evaluate genetic
variation identified by GWAS for five metabolic phenotypes: blood
pressure (Ehret et al., 2011) (C. Newton-Che]? and P. Munroe, unpub-
lished data), body mass index (Locke et al., 2015), coronary artery
disease (Coronary Artery Disease (C4D) Genetics Consortium, 2011;
Schunkert et al., 2011), lipids (Global Lipids Genetics Consortium
et al., 2013) and type 2 diabetes (Morris et al., 2012). We present
GREGOR (Genomic Regulatory Elements and Gwas Overlap
algoRithm), an open source tool for evaluating enrichment as a
method to query the vast array of ENCODE data for the design of
functional experiments, enabling scientists with non—computational
backgrounds to prioritize variants and loci for functional follow—up.

2 Methods

We hypothesize that the index variant reported by GWAS is not ne—
cessarily the causal variant, owing to LD at associated regions. To
account for this, we first create a list of all potential causal variants

by selecting variants in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD; 1’2 > 0.7)
with trait—associated index SNPs in whole genome sequenced sam—
ples: the 1000 Genomes Phase 1 version 2 EUR Panel (Abecasis
et al., 2010). Reference data from non—European populations from
the 1000 Genomes Project are also available with GREGOR for se—
lection of LD proxies. Although many indicators of regulatory po—
tential exist for non—coding regions, we select DNase hypersensitive
sites (DHSs) as a general marker of functional importance to address
our first scientific question: which cell type shows strongest enrich—
ment of trait—associated loci? We gather data from the ENCODE
Project and when experimental replicates are available, we calculate
the union of DHSs derived from the same tissue (Supplementary
Table S1). We then examine overlap of these potential causal SNPs
with DHSs from various different tissue categories. By the same ap—
proach, we later evaluate the position of the index SNPs and their
LD proxies relative to histone methylation marks and ChIP—seq tran—
scription factor—binding sites (TFBS), as well as previously defined
functional chromatin states.

We calculate the total number of trait—associated loci at which ei—
ther the index SNP or at least one of its LD proxies overlaps with a
regulatory region across the genome (Supplementary Fig. S1). In
order to evaluate the significance of this observed overlap at each in—
dividual regulatory feature, we estimate the probability of the
observed overlap of GWAS SNPs relative to expectation using a set
of matched control variants. For each GWAS index SNP, we identify
a set of NS 00 control SNPs randomly selected from across the gen—
ome that match the index SNP for: (i) number of variants in LD, (ii)
minor allele frequency (:1%) and (iii) distance to the nearest gene.
When two or more GWAS index SNPs match each other following
the three criteria above, they share a set of control SNPs. We consider
that the number of index SNPs within its matched control set of
SNPs that overlaps a given feature follows a binomial distribution
with two parameters: (i) the number of GWAS index SNPs present in
the control set (1 or greater), and (ii) the proportion of SNPs within
the control set or their LD proxies that physically overlaps a feature.
Considering the number of index SNPs that overlaps with a feature,
we compute the sum of independent binomial random variables.
Then for each regulatory feature, we calculate the fold—enrichment
over expectation and an enrichment P—value that represents the prob—
ability that the overlap of control SNPs represented as a cumulative
probability distribution is greater than or equal to the observed over—
lap that we see from GWAS index SNPs (Table 1). We evaluated the
performance of our method using a range of parameters including
different numbers of variants in LD in the matched control sets, and
matched control set size (Supplementary Fig. S2). The magnitude of
enrichment is generally consistent across ranges of these parameters,
and the subsequent results use 1’2 : 0.7 with matched control set size
of > 500. P—values generated based on randomly permuted sets of
non—associated matched control SNPs are highly concordant with
estimated P—values (see Supplementary Methods section,
Supplementary Fig. S3).

We attempted to evaluate the type I error rate of our enrichment
method. We tested enrichment of 50 sets of randomly selected SNPs
in DHSs of different tissues. SNP sets were matched with lipid—
associated SNPs on 3 properties: number of LD proxies, minor allele
frequency and distance to the nearest gene. A QQ plot reveals
P—values that closely follow the null uniform distribution, whereas
the P—value distribution for lipid—associated variants sharply deviates
from the null (Supplementary Fig. S4). Additionally, we investigated
type I error by first partitioning DHSs of each tissue into genic land—
mark categories (Parker et al., 2013) and then randomly shufﬂing
within each category. After re—combining the DHS categories for

3 Results

3.1 Prioritizing tissue types for five phenotypes

using DHSs

Our first objective is to use available epigenomic data to identify
which tissues are the most biologically relevant to the trait—specific
genetic variation identified by GWAS. We evaluated enrichment of
independent GWAS loci for five related phenotypes: 99 blood pres—
sure loci (BP; 2.2% trait variance explained), 97 body mass index
loci (BMI; 2.7% trait variance explained) (Locke et al., 2015), 36
coronary artery disease loci (CAD; 10% trait variance explained)
(Schunkert et al., 2011), 157 lipid loci (high— and low— density lipo—
protein cholesterol, total cholesterol and triglycerides; 10—12% trait
variance explained) (Global Lipids Genetics Consortium et al.,
2013) and 65 type 2 diabetes loci (T2D; 10.7% trait variance ex—
plained) (Morris et al., 2012). DHSs are open regions of DNA ac—
cessible to protein binding, and are important in the transcriptional
activity within a given cell. ENCODE has experimentally identified
DHSs using DNase—seq in hundreds of cell types. We evaluate en—
richment of GWAS loci in the union DHSs of cell types derived from
the same tissue (Supplementary Table S1). By testing five sets of
trait—associated SNPs in DHSs of 41 tissue types, we set a Bonferroni
corrected threshold for significance at P < 2.4 X 1074.

GWAS loci were significantly enriched in DHSs of tissues that
are remarkably consistent with our biological understanding of the
trait (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table S2).

For example, BP—associated variants are highly enriched in DHSs in
cell types derived from blood vessel (P : 1.2 X 1079; fold enrichment
1.5) and heart (P 25.3 X 1078; fold enrichment 1.6); CAD—associated
variants in DHSs from heart (P: 2.3 X 1075; fold enrichment 1.7) and
blood (P: 5.6 X 1075; fold enrichment 1.4); lipid—associated variants
in DHSs from liver (P : 2.0 X 10’“; fold enrichment 1.6), monocytes
(P: 7.1 X 10713; fold enrichment 1.9) and blood (P247 X 10’“;
fold enrichment 1.4); and BMI—associated variants in DHSs in frontal
cortex (P : 8.8 X 1075; fold enrichment 1.7). We also find enrichment
of BMI—associated variants in DHSs of human olfactory neurosphere—
derived cells from mucosal biopsies (P24.2 X 1075; fold enrichment

1.7), suggesting a plausible link between olfaction and food intake.
However, there are other cases in which we find enrichment of trait—
associated variants in unexpected tissue types. For example, although
we observe significant enrichment of T2D—associated variants in pan—
creatic tissue as expected (P : 1.0 X 1074; fold enrichment 1.6 ), we see
stronger evidence for enrichment in heart tissue (P: 1.4 X 1076; fold
enrichment 1.7) and embryonic stem cells (P : 2.5 X 10’6; fold enrich—
ment 1.5 ). We used this knowledge to guide subsequent enrichment
analysis of other epigenomic features by focusing on the most signifi—
cant cell types to reduce the multiple testing burden in subsequent as—
sessments of additional regulatory features. This data—driven approach
to reduction of a large set of potentially relevant regulatory elements in
a myriad of cell lines and tissues can be used for phenotypes where lit—
tle is known about the biology, and may also identify novel tissues
where these GWAS loci are actively transcribed. Alternatively, investi—
gators might bypass this step and instead use a priori biological know—
ledge to focus on a specific tissue or cell type. One could also integrate
the two approaches to choose some empirically—selected cell types but
up—weight biologically relevant cell types.

We additionally investigate whether enrichment is tissue type—
specific. Given the wealth of DHS data available, often in replicates
and for multiple cell types from the same tissue type, we hypothesize
that each cell type has some level of missing data and artifacts. To
address this, we define ‘consensus’ regions of open chromatin that
are commonly shared among at least 50% of all cell types within a
single tissue group, and re—evaluate enrichment of lipid—associated
GWAS variants. We additionally compare results for consensus
thresholds (proportion of cell types required to show a DHS at that
genomic position) of 100, 75, 25% and the union of cell types
derived from the same tissue. We found that when we used stricter
definitions to select functional regions (e.g. 100% of cell types were
required to share the DHS), we typically observed higher fold en—
richment, but less significant enrichment P—values (Supplementary
Fig. S5, Supplementary Table S3). Conversely, when we relaxed the
criterion to allow DHSs observed in only 25 % of cell types, we typ—
ically observed stronger P—values but lower fold enrichment. This is
likely due to inclusion of more artefactual DHSs using the relaxed
definition, but exclusion of true DHSs under the strict definition. In
subsequent analyses, we used the most relaxed definition of regula—
tory elements by including any element observed in at least one rep—
licate or cell type within each tissue category. We opted to be more
inclusive to allow for the most complete identification of DHSs.

richment P—value. White indicates not significant after Bonferroni correction.

3.2 Prioritizing regulatory elements in selected tissues
Following prioritization of important tissue types for GWAS of a
specific phenotype, we next selected specific regulatory elements
that were enriched for GWAS variants in cell types derived from
relevant tissues, focusing solely on the tissues selected in Step 1. We
evaluated enrichment of trait—associated variants in chromatin states
predicted from histone methylation marks and a learned multivari—
ate hidden Markov model (Ernst et al., 2011) (Supplementary
Fig. S6, Supplementary Table S4). Confirming previous reports
(Maurano et al., 2012), we found significant enrichment of genetic
variation in weak and strong enhancer states for nearly all pheno—
types tested. Trait—associated variants are most highly enriched in
active promoters commonly marked by H3K4me2, H3K4me3,
acetylation, or H2A.Z. There is less striking enrichment in domains
that contain repressed genes such as H3K9me2, H3K9me3 or
H3K27me3.

We further evaluated enrichment in TFBS and histone modifica—
tions identified by ChIP—Seq. We investigated any Tier 1 or 2
ENCODE cell types available for relevant tissues identified in Step
1, taking the union of experimental replicates when available. For
cell types HepG2, Monocytes CD14+ (R001746), GM12878,
K562 and CD20+ (ROO1778), we find significant enrichment of
lipid—associated variation for key transcriptional machinery includ—
ing RNA Polymerase II (P: 6.2 X 10’“; fold enrichment 2.0) and
the ubiquitous transcription factor SP1 (P: 1.5 X 10’”; fold en—
richment 3.0). In addition, lipid—associated variants are highly en—
riched in binding sites of RCOR1 (P : 1.8 X 10716; fold enrichment
2.1), EP300 (P: 1.2 X 10*“; fold enrichment 2.0), JUND
(P:2.2 X 10’“; fold enrichment 2.0) and H3K4me3
(P:1.4 X 10’”; fold enrichment 2.1) (Supplementary Table S5).
We tested a total of 158 regulatory features, 75 of which reach
Bonferroni significance with P<3.2 X 1074. We are particularly
interested in 15 known lipid gene regulators as well as 16 transcrip—
tion factors and 4 histone markers associated with lipid change in
the literature. Of the 75 Bonferroni significant regulatory features,
18 of these are among this a priori—defined lipid—related list of 35
elements.

diction (rs737337), which is also the top SNP as reported by GWAS at this
locus. The blue dotted line annotates the control SNP (rs3810308). Regulatory
elements highlighted in red show overlap with the purple candidate func-
tional variant

3.3 Prioritizing candidate functional variants using
selected regulatory elements in relevant tissues

As we gain knowledge about the transcriptional machinery that acts
in concert with trait—associated genetic variation, we can make more
informed predictions about potential functional variants at a single
locus. We hypothesize that variants present within multiple regula—
tory domains are more likely to play a role in transcriptional regula—
tion within a cell. Subsequently, we can use this information in
combination with functional protein—coding information, transcript
level annotation, and deleteriousness scoring to prioritize loci and
individual variants for functional follow—up.

We proceeded to prioritize potential functional variants in the
157 known lipid—associated loci (Supplementary Fig. S7). With the
assumption that a protein—coding variant is likely the functional
driver of transcription at a given locus, we excluded any lipid—associ—
ated loci from follow—up consideration that contains at least one
non—synonymous variant in LD (72>0.7) with the GWAS index
SNP. This resulted in 103 remaining loci for further evaluation. We
next examined our results from Step 2 to focus on the selected tran—
scription factors and histone marks, and prioritized loci at which
multiple transcription factors bind in blood, monocytes, or liver. In
a data—driven approach, we ﬂagged variants that overlap with a sub—
set of significantly enriched regulatory domains as plausible func—
tional candidate SNPs (71:23). We evaluated overlap of GWAS
variants at candidate loci in lipid gene regulators as well as tran—
scription factors and histone marks involved with lipid change in the
literature. Variants at a set of five of these loci that overlap with at
least eight (25 %) lipid—related regulatory features were commonly
found using both the data—driven and biological—driven selection of
regulatory features, including the known functional variant

The PGL4 empty vector control is on the far left, while the predicted functional
variant and control variant follow next in each individual locus figure

r512740374 at SORTI (Musunuru et al., 2010). Many of these can—
didate variants are also eQTLs in liver, omental fat or subcutaneous
fat or had at least one surrogate SNP in LD (1’2 > 0.7) with the eQTL
SNP at that locus (eQTL P < 1 X 1073) (Schadt et al., 2008). In add—
ition to considering these various data, we counted the number of
variants at each locus and focused on loci with relatively few num—
bers of variants to increase the likelihood of identifying the func—
tional variant. Thus, we narrowed down the list of lipid loci that
likely have a strong impact on regulating transcription to guide us to
promising candidates for functional follow—up.

After analyzing the overlap of non—coding variants with biolo—
gical TFBS from ChIP—seq and using our criteria of non—coding vari—
ants, eQTLs, and number of variants at a locus, we chose five loci
and picked one SNP from each region that had some evidence of
being the functional variant due to overlap with the most regulatory
regions for further study (FAM117B: rs11692610; ANGPTLS:
rs737337; SPTLC3: r51321940; IRFZBPZ: r5526936; ADH5:
rs1800759) (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. S8).

At each locus, we selected an additional variant with no pre—
dicted C/EBP binding site overlapping as an internal control
(FAM117B: r511694172; ANGPTLS: 1353810308; SPTLC3:
rs364585; IRFZBPZ: r5514230; ADH5: r52602836). Variant
r512740374 from the SORTI locus has previously been demon—
strated to alter a C/EBP TFBS (Musunuru et al., 2010), and thus was
used as a positive control here (rs629301 as the SORTI locus in—
ternal control).

of the non—coding SNP polymorphism on transcription factor bind—
ing at each of the six lipid loci. We generated luciferase constructs
containing :300—400 bp around each genetic variant (generating
the alternate allele with site—directed mutagenesis) and transfected
them into HepG2 cells over—expressing C/EBP—B. We normalized
luciferase activities to the pcDNA3.1—co—transfected groups (control
construct with no C/EBP—B DNA inserted), and found robust lucifer—
ase activity increase in the rs12740374—T construct compared
with r512740374—G from the SORTI locus (fold increase : 1.8,
P : 4 X 1074), which was consistent with the previous report.
Similarly, for the other five loci examined, the single nucleotide
changes in other predicted functional SNP sites caused significant luci—
ferase activity differences in response to C/EBP—B over—expression
(P < 0.05), indicating those non—coding variants may change transcrip—
tion factor binding activity in GWAS loci and possibly affect down—
stream gene expression (Fig. 3). After correction for 12 tests (2 SNPs at
six loci), we still find significant differences between the two alleles
(P < 0.05) at the candidate functional SNP for five out of the six loci
(SORTI: r512740374—T; ANGPTLS: rs737337—C; FAM117B:
r511692610—T; IRFZBPZ: r5526936—C; SPTLC3: r51321940-G). In
contrast, the luciferase signal changes of the internal control SNP con—
structs were significant at Bonferroni levels for only two of the six loci.

Our results are generally supported by post hoc annotations of
predicted regulatory elements defined by RegulomeDB (Boyle et al.,
2012). For example, the RegulomeDB score of the GWAS HDL
cholesterol—associated index SNP at the SPTLC3 locus (rs3645 85 ) is
5, indicating that there is TF binding or DNase peak epigenomic
data to support its functionality. In contrast, the RegulomeDB score
of our predicted functional SNP at this locus (rs1321940) is 2a,
indicating that it is likely to affect binding based on evidence of TF
binding, and the presence of a matched TF motif, DNase footprint,
and DNase peak. Among all 18 variants within 1’2 > 0.7 of the index
SNP at this locus, only 2 SNPs have a score of 2b or better. We ob—
serve similar trends for other loci at which we performed experimen—
tal follow—up (Supplementary Fig. S8). Counterintuitively, the

known functional variant rs12740374 at the SORTI locus has a
RegulomeDB score of 2b, whereas the variant reported by GWAS in
that region, rs629301, has a higher score of 1f. This result empha—
sizes the need to consider multiple sources of data when prioritizing
functional candidates for experimental follow—up. Although annota—
tion of individual variants is useful in predicting the potential impact
of a single variant, GREGOR considers all trait—associated variants
in aggregate to prioritize which functional elements and in which tis—
sues they are most relevant for the trait being examined. An alterna—
tive is considering the entirety of ENCODE data, much of which
will represent irrelevant tissue types or highly correlated data sets.

4 Summary

We have developed a systematic approach for evaluating enrichment
of trait—associated variants in epigenomic features, allowing us to pri—
oritize tissues, regulatory elements, and potential functional variants
that affect transcriptional regulation (Fig. 4). Our method takes into
account all potential causal variants at a locus due to LD and esti—
mates enrichment with particular regulatory features using matched
control variants. It is an unbiased approach that can be used to nar—
row the focus of cell types and regulatory features that does not rely
on a priori knowledge of biological mechanisms. The resultant find—
ings will guide us to a more global understanding of the underlying
epigenomic architecture leading to trait—specific variation.

We present here one reasonable approach for prioritizing the po—
tential functional variant at a locus. We attempted to select loci with
the best chance of demonstrating a functional variant for experimen—
tal follow—up. However, our approach is limited to only one poten—
tial functional variant per locus and does not claim to definitively
identify the true or only functional variant at any locus. More com—
prehensive interrogation of variation within a locus will be required
to fully understand the underlying molecular mechanisms involved.

Different cell types and tissues are more easily accessible than
others for sequencing. This approach will become even more
impactful as we develop an increasingly comprehensive and diverse
interrogation of the epigenome to answer important biological ques—
tions about the regulatory role of non—coding variation. In all, this
approach will help guide our knowledge of the important mechan—
isms occurring outside of protein—coding regions that underlie cell—
type—specific transcriptional regulation.

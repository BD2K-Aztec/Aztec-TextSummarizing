Abstract

Motivation: The Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip has been extensively utilized in
epigenome—wide association studies. This array and its successor, the MethylationEPlC array, use
two types of probes—Infinium | (type I) and Infinium H (type ||)—in order to increase genome cover—
age but differences in probe chemistries result in different type | and II distributions of methylation
values. Ignoring the difference in distributions between the two probe types may bias downstream
analysis.

Results: Here, we developed a novel method, called Regression on Correlated Probes (RCP), which
uses the existing correlation between pairs of nearby type | and II probes to adjust the beta values
of all type II probes. We evaluate the effect of this adjustment on reducing probe design type bias,
reducing technical variation in duplicate samples, improving accuracy of measurements against
known standards, and retention of biological signal. We find that RCP is statistically significantly
better than unadjusted data or adjustment with alternative methods including SWAN and BMIQ.
Availability: We incorporated the method into the R package ENmiX, which is freely available from
the Bioconductor website (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/htmI/ENmix.htm|).

1 lntroductlon probes have a smaller dynamic range and are not as reproducible as

The advance of DNA methylation arrays in recent years has enabled
large—scale epigenome—wide studies at single CpG site resolution.
The Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Bibikova
et (11., 2011) is currently the most commonly utilized array. It pro—
vides measurement of methylation level at about half a million indi—
vidual CpG sites. Its successor, the Infinium MethylationEpic
BeadChip, provides measurement of methylation level at more than
850 000 sites. To increase CpG coverage across the human genome,
both arrays utilize probes of two different chemistries, Infinium I
(type I) and Infinium II (type II). However, methylation measure—
ments (beta values) derived from the two types of probes exhibit dif—
ferent distributions. In particular, beta values derived from type II

the beta values derived from type I probes (Dedeurwaerder et (11.,
2011).

Several methods have been proposed to normalize the beta val—
ues derived from the two types of probes. These include adjusting
the beta values from both types of probes so that they are more
‘comparable’ (e.g. SWAN (Maksimovic et (11., 2012) implemented in
the minfi package), or adjusting beta values from type II probes
using beta values from type I probes as referents, (e.g. the Peak
Based Correction (PBC) (Dedeurwaerder et (11., 2011) and Beta
MIxture Quantile dilation (BMIQ) (Teschendorff et (11., 2013).
Here, we proposed a novel method of adjusting type II probe beta
values based on the correlation between a subset of closely spaced

pairs of type I and II probes. This method, Regression on Correlated
Probes (RCP), is simple, accurate and efficient. We tested RCP on
multiple datasets and found that RCP outperformed BMIQ and
other methods. RCP has been implemented in Bioconductor package
ENmix (Xu et (11., 2015), is freely available for use, and can be com—
bined with other pre—processing methods.

2 Methods

2.1 RCP: Regression on correlated probes
Spatial correlation of DNA methylation is well known (Eckhardt
et (11., 2006; Zhang et (11., 2015) with CpG sites near to one another
(e.g. <100 base pairs) often having similar methylation, particularly
if they have similar genomic context (e.g. location in CpG island,
shore or shelf). Taking advantage of this correlation we propose a
novel method, RCP, which uses a subset of type I and II probe pairs
to derive the quantitative relationship between different probe type
measurements. Once derived, this relationship is used to recalibrate
all of the less—accurate type II probe measurements so that they more
closely approximate the more accurate type I probe measurements.
RCP first identifies pairs of nearby (<25 base pairs apart) type I
and II probes that have the same genomic context according to
Illumina annotation (Island, N_Shelf, N_Shore, S_Shelf, S_shore or
OpenSea) and, for each sample, regresses the methylation M—value
(logit of beta value) quantiles obtained from the type I probes on the
corresponding quantiles for the type II probes. Using the estimated
linear regression coefficients ($0 and $1), RCP then adjusts all type
II probe measurements as:

Mi,adj I go +ﬁ1‘Mi7

where i is the index of a type II probe, M,- is the raw M—value of the
probe 1' and Mimi is the adjusted M—value. Finally, RCP uses the in—
verse logit function to convert the adjusted M—values Mimi to the ad—
justed beta values.

2.2 Evaluation datasets

Dataset 1: A total of 19 pairs of duplicate whole blood samples (38
samples total) from Markunas et al. (2014). As part of this study,
duplicate samples were located on separate 96 well plates that
underwent independent bisulfite conversion, hybridization and
array scanning. To avoid possible impact on evaluations we
excluded 69 075 probes, including probes with non—specific binding,
probes with common (MAF>0.05) SNPs at CpG target regions,
probes on sex chromosomes and probes with multimodal methyla—
tion distributions identified using the ENmix package. We also
excluded data points with low quality methylation values where the
number of beads was less than 3 or detection P—value greater than
0.05.

Dataset 2: A total of 39 methylation laboratory standard control
samples reported by Xu et al. (2015). Human unmethylated DNA
(HCT116 double knock out (DKO) of both DNA methyltransfer—
ases DNMT1 (—/—) and DNMT3b (—/—)) and fully methylated DNA
(HCT116 DKO DNA enzymatically methylated) were obtained
commercially (Zymo Research, Irving CA) and mixed together in
different proportions to create laboratory control samples with spe—
cific methylation levels: 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 50, 60, 80 and 100%
methylated. Replicates for each methylation level (n : 10, 3, 2, 3, 3,
2, 3, 3 and 10, respectively) were independently assayed on different
arrays.

Three publically available methylation datasets have been uti—
lized to evaluate various probe type bias correction methods in a

previous publication (Teschendorff et (11., 2013). To facilitate direct
comparison of different correction methods we evaluated RCP in
these same datasets:

Dataset 3: 450K dataset of three replicates from the
HCT116WT cell—line (Dedeurwaerder et (11., 2011) and matched
bisulfite pyrosequencing (BPS) data for nine type II probes
(Dedeurwaerder et (11., 2011 );

Dataset 4: 45 OK dataset of five fresh frozen (FF) head and neck
cancer (HNC) samples, of which two were HPV+ and three HPV—
(GEO accession number: GSM937820 to GSM937824; (Lechner
et (11., 2013)); and

Dataset 5: 45 OK dataset of 32 formalin—fixed paraffin—embedded
(FFPE) HNC samples, of which 18 were HPV+ and 14 HPV— (GEO
accession number: GSE3 8266; (Lechner et (11., 2013)). Note that the
original GEO dataset GSE3 8266 contains datasets for 42 FFPE
HNC samples, of which 10 were excluded from the evaluation due
to poor data quality.

3 Results

3.1 RCP is robust to parameter selections

RCP is based on regression estimates in methylation M—value quan—
tiles between nearby type I and II probes. To investigate the robust—
ness of RCP to the distance cutoff between type I and II probes, we
chose four distance cutoffs: 10 bp (resulting in 6523 pairs), 25 bp
(15 855 pairs), 50 bp (27 937 pairs) and 100 bp (47 090 pairs). To
investigate robustness to the number of evenly spaced quantiles we
chose three sets of quantiles with 199, 999 and 1999 members. For
each of the 38 samples in Dataset 1, we used the twelve different
combinations of distance and quantiles to obtain RCP—adjusted type
II beta values. Using the values obtained from one of these twelve
combinations (cutoff: 25 bp and 999 quantiles) as the referent, we
observed little difference in the resulting adjusted beta values ob—
tained with different distance or quantile combinations
(Supplementary Table 1). Thus, for all of the subsequent RCP ana—
lyses presented here, we used a distance cutoff of 25 base pairs and
999 evenly spaced quantiles (0.001, 0.002,. . ., 0.999).

3.2 RCP reduces probe design type bias

RCP reduces probe—type bias such that type I and II probes have dis—
tributions with similar modes (a mode here is a value at which the
distribution has a local maximum value) and dynamic ranges
(Fig. 1). For the 38 samples in Dataset 1, the average absolute differ—
ence between type I and II probes for the first (left) mode in raw
beta value distributions was 0.014 (SD : 0.007) and for the second
(right) mode was 0.1 1 (SD : 0.02). After RCP adjustment, the mode
location differences were significantly reduced to 0.001
(SD : 0.001) and 0.005 (SD : 0.003) (Student paired Ttest P : 1.1
><10_12 and 1.5 X 10‘29 , respectively).

3.3 RCP reduces technical variation

Similar to Xu et al. (2013), we calculated the mean—centered cor—
relation and the mean absolute difference between duplicates in
Dataset 1. We used these two measures as performance metrics to
evaluate the effect of RCP and alternative methods on technical
variation and reproducibility. As shown in Table 1, all three
methods (RCP, SWAN and BMIQ) provided significant improve—
ment over raw values for type II probes; and direct comparison of
RCP to other methods showed that RCP was significantly better
than BMIQ and SWAN for both performance metrics. As a fur—
ther test of RCP in reducing technical variation, and to facilitate

RCP

 

direct comparisons with previously published methods, we repli—
cated the analysis of Dataset 3 originally published in
Dedeurwaerder et al. (2011) and again in Teschendorff et al.
(2013). Using the three replicate 450K measurements made on
HCT116 WT cell—lines we computed the standard deviation for
each probe after different adjustment methods. RCP provided the
greatest reduction in variation for type II probes (Fig. 2A), and
that reduction is statistically significant compared against either
raw data (P < 2.2 X 1046) or BMIQ (P < 2.2 X 1046). RCP also
reduced the average absolute difference in methylation between
replicate pairs (Fig. 2B), and that reduction is statistically signifi—
cant against raw data (P < 2.2 X 10‘16 for all three pairs respect—
ively) and BMIQ (P < 2.2 X 10‘16 for all three pairs
respectively).

3.4 RCP improves data accuracy

In order to determine the effect of different adjustment methods on
methylation accuracy we evaluated RCP and alternative methods
using data from a set of laboratory controls with known methyla—
tion ranging from 0 to 100% (Dataset 2). We compared the per—
formance of all three methods (RCP, SWAN and BMIQ) on

probes (Type II) and RCP adjusted beta values from Type II probes (Type II—
RCP) for a typical sample whole blood sample (Markunas et al., 2014)

improving data accuracy for beta values from type II probes. In par—
ticular, for each of the 39 samples, we identified the mode of the dis—
tribution of beta values from type II probes following different
adjustment methods. We then calculated the absolute difference be—
tween the expected methylation level (0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 50, 60, 80 or
100%) and the average of the modes obtained from the replicate
samples representing that methylation level. Overall RCP had
modes that were significantly closer to the expected level than
raw data (P : 1.7 X 10-9), SWAN (P z 1.8 X 10-1") and BMIQ
(P z 1.2 X 10-4). Additionally, unlike BMIQ and SWAN, the RCP
modes were always more accurate than raw values (Fig. 3).

As a further test that RCP adjusts beta values closer to true
methylation values and to facilitate direct comparisons with other
published methods we reanalyzed Dataset 3 for which bisulfite pyro—
sequencing (BPS) measurements of nine type II probe sites were
available (Dedeurwaerder et (11., 2011). These BPS data were used as
a gold standard by previous publications (Dedeurwaerder et (11.,
2011; Teschendorff et (11., 2013). For the replicate in GEO dataset
GSM815138, we calculated the absolute difference in beta value
from the true estimate obtained by pyrosequencing at each of the
nine probe sites. RCP outperforms raw and BMIQ—adjusted meas—
ures with RCP having statistically significantly smaller mean devi—
ations from pyrosequencing results than raw beta values (P : 0.005)
and BMIQ (P : 0.004) (Fig. 4).

3.5 RCP identifies more CpG sites associated with HPV
status

A bias correction method should retain biological signals while reducing
the technical variation. Similar to Teschendorff et al. (2013) we used a
cross validation strategy to evaluate how RCP performs in identifying
Cst associated with HPV status. The two HPV+ and three HPV—
HNC samples in Dataset 4 were used as a discovery set to identify HPV
status—related differentially methylated CpG sites using the limma
method (Smyth, 2004). The test set consists of 18 HPV+ and 14 HPV—
FFPE HNC samples in Dataset 5 (Lechner et (11., 2013). At false discov—
ery rate (FDR) cutoff 0.35 (the same cutoff used by Teschendorff et al.),
we identified similar numbers of differentially methylated CpG sites to
those originally reported by Teschendorff et al. (2013) in raw data or
BIVIIQ adjusted data (Table 2). RCP outperformed SWAN, PBC and
BIVIIQ: it identified the most differentially methylated CpG sites (290)
in the training set (Dataset 4), resulted the largest number of validated
sites (81 ), and had the highest positive predictive value (PPV : 0.28). 56
sites were validated in both BMIQ—adjusted and RCP—adjusted data
(Supplementary Table 2).

BeadChips that reduces technical noise and improves measurement
quality of type II probes. Although type I probes were used exclu—

raw beta values and adjusted beta values by BMIQ and RCP respectively

increasingly replaced them on subsequent arrays by type II probes,
which now comprise 72% of the 450K array and 84% of the EPIC
array. While type II probes facilitate increased array density, they
cannot substitute for type I probes at some CpG sites and have
decreased dynamic range and reproducibility compared to type I
probes (Dedeurwaerder et 61]., 2011). Taking advantage of the high
spatial correlation of DNA methylation levels along the human gen—
ome, RCP utilizes nearby type I and II probe pairs that share the
same genomic context to derive a quantitative relationship between

probe types for each sample using a quantile linear regression model,
and then monotonically and smoothly recalibrates all type II probe
measures of the sample based on the regression estimates.
Evaluation of multiple datasets shows that RCP consistently outper—
forms PBC, SWAN and BMIQ in correcting probe design bias and
improving data quality.

Like SWAN and BMIQ, RCP uses quantile information to nor—
malize type II probe measures toward comparable type I probe
measures. SWAN assumes that type I and II probes have identical
distributions across the entire genome if they share similar genomic
context and adjusts the distributions of both sets of probes to match.
This assumption may not hold given that the use of type I and II
probes in the methylation array is non—random. SWAN normaliza—
tion adversely alters type I data, resulting in increased type I
probe technical variation, reduced concordance between duplicates
(Table 1), and results in few validated differentially methylated sites
(Table 2). RCP only assumes comparable quantiles between type I
and II probes that are in close proximity and have the same genomic
context. Like BMIQ, RCP leaves the values of type I probes un—
changed. BMIQ utilizes a model—based approach, and assumes that
methylation values from type I and II probes will fit a three—state
beta—mixture distribution model. After finding the best fit for type I
probes, it assumes the same model for type II probes, reassigning the
quantiles of the type II probes according to the type I distribution.
BMIQ model parameter estimation is computationally intensive
(e.g. 500 sample processing time of 7.8 h for BMIQ versus 2.5 min
for RCP with one CPU core) which may be problematic for large
studies. Although the model works reasonably well for most data, it
may not fit some experimental data, resulting in highly inaccurate
adjustments that are much worse than raw data (Fig. 3). RCP is dir—
ectly applicable to the new Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip
and can be used with other preprocessing methods to improve data
quality. It is incorporated as a user—selectable function into ENmix
(Xu et al., 2015), a multiprocessor—capable R package that contains

a suite of preprocessing, data quality, and visualization tools de—
signed to facilitate large—scale analysis of methylation data.

5 Conclusions

RCP is a novel and computationally efficient method to correct
probe type design bias for Illumina methylation BeadChips. It can
significantly improve data quality for type II probes, resulting in
increased precision and detection of true biological signals in DNA
methylation analysis.

Please note that the datasets we have used in Saha et [11. (2014)
have been used in several prior works as benchmark datasets.
Please see Pinho et a1. (2012), Ochoa et a1. (2014), and many
others. These datasets were not chosen to skew the results. To
ensure fairness it is a standard practice to use the same bench-
mark datasets to compare different algorithms. This is exactly
what we have done.

For datasets D1 and D5, Deorowicz et [11. claim that the results
reported in Saha et [11. (2014) are incorrect. To ensure the cor-
rectness we have rerun our program for the aforementioned data-
sets and got exactly the same results we have reported in Saha
et [11. (2014). Thus the claim of incorrectness is inappropriate.
We have uploaded HG18 and YH (please see Section 2) datasets
so that anyone can verify the correctness of the reported results.

Deorowicz et [11. say: ‘First, the cited paper incorrectly reported
‘NA’ for the CDC algorithm in these two cases.’ Here
Deorowicz et [11. refer to datasets D1 and D2. The fact is that
GDC was not able to compress the single chromosome of the D1
and D2 datasets within 2 h. We stopped GDC after 2 h. Here
again the use of the word ‘incorrectly’ is not appropriate. We
have uploaded the programs GDC by Deorowicz et a1. (2011)
and iDoComp by Ochoa et a1. (2014) that we have used to com-
pare with ERGC (please see Section 2).

The use of KOREAN genomes as the references was not inten-
tional. For instance we have used hg18 in the D1 dataset as the
reference.

Deorowicz et [11. claim that ‘The KOREAN genomes differ from
the other ones in that they contain both lower and upper case let-
ters.’ It is not the case. For example in D4 and D5 both the

references and the targets contain both upper case and lower
case letters.

° Deorowicz et al. have rerun the programs by changing all the
characters to upper case. The results are shown in Table 3.
When it comes to (lossless) compression, we don’t have the
option of making such changes. If we do so, we lose informa—
tion and such an algorithm will be a lossy compression
algorithm!

° Sequencers employing the state—of—the—art sequencing technology
produce genomic sequences that contain both lower and upper
case letters. Cases of letters carry important information in the
context of molecular biology. In the UCSC genome database,
genomes HG17 to HG38 all contain both upper case and lower
case letters. Moreover ERGC is not restricted to A, C, G, T and
N characters. There are several other valid characters that are
used in clones to indicate ambiguity about the identity of certain
bases in the sequence. It is not uncommon to see these wobble
codes at polymorphic positions in DNA sequences. ERGC can
handle virtually every character in the genomic sequences.
Furthermore, ERGC is an order of magnitude faster than GDC
or iDoComp on an average.

° We have run our software tool on different datasets (please,
see Table 1). In A1 and A2 datasets ERGC is comparable with
CDC. In A3, A4, A7 and A8 datasets ERGC performs better
than GDC. GDC outperformed ERGC heavily on A5 and A6
datasets. Please note that both HG38 and HG19 contain
both upper case and lower case letters. Moreover, GDC
automatically selects the best reference genome among the
sequences.

° Note that we have downloaded GDC from: sun.aei.polsl.pl/
REFRESH/gdc/downloads/O.3/gdc on 10/31/2014; iDoComp
was downloaded from: www.Stanford.edu/Niochoa/iDoComp.

Abstract

Summary: As sequencing becomes cheaper and more widely available, there is a greater need to
quickly and effectively analyze large—scale genomic data. While the functionality of AVIA v1.0,
whose implementation was based on ANNOVAR, was comparable with other annotation web ser—
vers, AVIA v2.0 represents an enhanced web—based server that extends genomic annotations to
cell—specific transcripts and protein—level functional annotations. With AVIA’s improved interface,
users can better visualize their data, perform comprehensive searches and categorize both coding
and non—coding variants.

Availability and implementation: AVIA is freely available through the web at http://avia.abcc.

1 Introduction

Exome sequencing has become the most popular means to evaluate
variants in the context of disease. Many clinical panels focus on spe—
cific known genes associated with specific diseases or pathways.
Accessing all available data about a given mutation can be difficult;
from comprehending each database or algorithm to obtaining the
computational power to annotate, filter and prioritize lists of vari—
ants. To this end, an updated version of the Annotation,
yisualization and lmpact Analysis web server (AVIA v.2.0) is
presented, which incorporates features to help users understand
processes within a cell as it relates to disease. AVIA v2.0 is a unique
annotation portal in that it incorporates information from >40 an—
notation databases and allows for custom annotations. The new fea—
tures of AVIA v.2.0 increase its applicability as a hub for genomics,
gene, and protein annotations.

2 Tool Description

The first version of AVIA (Vuong et (11., 2014) leveraged
ANNOVAR (Wang et (11., 2010) as the foundation for gene—based
annotations and focused primarily on SNP—level annotations. AVIA
v2.0 departs from its previous version by providing integrated access
to genomic and proteomic databases and functional annotations. In
addition, the availability of a wider range of input options, including
gene lists and protein mutations, classification of potentially signifi—
cant SNPs and genes, and pathway visualization layered with anno—
tation data, also distinguishes AVIA v2.0 from other annotation
servers. A comparison between our server and others is available at
http://avia.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/apps/site/compare. Conversion tools are
also available to assist in navigating AVIA between genomic and
protein tools. The integration of bioDBnet (http://biodbnet.abcc.
ncifcrf.gov) (Mudunuri et (11., 2009), a conversion tool that easily

tates the discovery of the relationships between SNPs, genes, expres—
sion, protein and biological networks for analysis. As seen in Figure
1, the improved results page is more intuitive, more informative and
better suited for exploratory analysis.

2.1 Enhancement of features
AVIA v2.0 improves upon several tools for exploratory analysis that
are not offered as standalone web applications elsewhere. A java—
script protein structure visualization viewer, JSmol (http://source
forge.net/projects/jsmol), was incorporated to view users’ mutations
in the context of protein structure along with a side—by—side com—
parison of the amino acid properties. Since many full length protein
structures are not available within the Protein Data Bank (http://
www.rcsb.org), we have begun modeling proteins using I—Tasser
(Roy et (11., 2010) to attain a comprehensive protein structure li—
brary. Our set of full length predicted protein structure is available
to shed insight on how an amino acid substitution could potentially
affect the protein folding or function. The set of predicted structures
is continually being expanded and partial experimental structures
are used whenever they contain the position of the observed variant.

AVIAv2.0 helps users classify their variants by automatically ﬂag—
ging those of significant consequence, e.g., protein damaging or clinic—
ally relevant variants, as a separate annotation column in the report.
In addition, a gene list summarizing variants in genes based on specific
categories, e.g., genes with multiple damaging scores the protein scor—
ing algorithm or post—translational modifications, is displayed in a
heatmap for each category. AVIA also seamlessly integrates the
DAVID—WS API (Jiao et (11., 2012) for functional analysis and cluster—
ing of genes and FunSeq2 (Fu et (11., 2014) for scoring large genomic
variant datasets by functionally relevant coding and non—coding vari—
ants. The addition of these tools helps prioritize genes for further in—
vestigation and associates specific mutations to dysfunction through
clinically and functionally relevant assessments.

AVIA v2.0 also adapts PathView (Luo and Brouwer, 2013), an
R package that renders biological data on top of the KEGG
(Kanehisa et (11., 2012) pathway maps, to help users visualize how
affected genes may act as hubs within pathways or how their inter—
actions may disrupt cellular activity. For AVIA, ‘state’ data are
shown to reﬂect the degree to which several databases score damag—
ing genes based on variant data. By default, there are six states
showing the scores for the protein scoring databases and prioritiza—
tion (represented between 0 and 1) for a gene. The most severe score

for each database is used to represent that gene (i.e., if there are two
mutations for the same gene with different score for FunSeq2, the
most severe score is chosen). KEGG pathways containing the users’
genes are displayed. Users can also interact with the KEGG pathway
map by clicking on their highlighted gene and viewing the additional
gene information in KEGG. Future implementations of the
PathView feature in AVIA will allow users to select which databases
to represent as state data.

For information on the implementation of any of these tools,
please see Supplemental Data S1.

2.2 Databases

To our knowledge, AVIA v2.0 combines more databases than any
other variant annotation web server and now offers gene—based an—
notations ranging in categories from regulation and expression data
to protein and network annotation. Data obtained from the Gene
Expression Atlas (GNF) through the BioGPS portal (Wu et (11.,
2009) are included to show tissue—specific normal gene expression
levels and interaction networks. The expression levels for each gene
were ranked by tissue type and then divided into three ranks, repre—
senting high, medium and low expressions. Users’ data with ranked
expression levels for each gene and tissue type are displayed on the
interactive results page along with summary information of damag—
ing mutations and integration of BioGPS’s graphic API for visualiza—
tion (http://biogps.org). Normal gene expression may be helpful to
researchers performing exploratory work focusing on tissue specifi—
city. Other databases covering post—translational modifications,
interactome, metabolome, pharmacogenomics information and clin—
ical data are made available for the users’ gene list. Each database
will help guide exploratory analysis and may offer insight into genes
and their associations in the context of disease.

3 Conclusion

As the number of databases and tools become more abundant, it
becomes increasingly time consuming for researchers to leverage all
of the available tools and resources. Since very little is known
about many genes and their role in the context of disease, our ap—
proach is to provide users with the most comprehensive, up—to—date
data available. This would promote exploratory analysis and
pathway visualization and help highlight biological dysfunction and
increase the understanding of cellular processes as they relate to
disease.

Together, the extra functionalities detailed here help AVIA v2.0
mature as a hub for genomics, gene and protein annotations by inte—
grating several different types of databases and applications in a
fast, comprehensive and significant manner.

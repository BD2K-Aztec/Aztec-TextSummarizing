ABSTRACT

Motivation: GSATools is a free software package to analyze conform-
ational ensembles and to detect functional motions in proteins by
means of a structural alphabet. The software integrates with the
widely used GROMACS simulation package and can generate a
range of graphical outputs. Three applications can be supported:
(i) investigation of the conformational variability of local structures;
(ii) detection of allosteric communication; and (iii) identification of
local regions that are critical for global functional motions. These ana-
lyses provide insights into the dynamics of proteins and allow for
targeted design of functional mutants in theoretical and experimental
studies.

1 INTRODUCTION

Biomolecular motions play a key role in several biological func-
tions: enzymatic activity, proteineprotein interactions, ligand
binding and allosteric regulation. Computational approaches,
such as molecular dynamics (MD), are now routinely used to
reproduce the intrinsic dynamics of proteins, but effective tools
are still required to gain functional insight from the simulated
data.

Global collective motions are often associated with biological
functions, and it was demonstrated that these motions can be
extracted from conformational ensembles (Amadei et al., 1993).

In a previous study, we suggested a method aimed at recover-
ing the role of local conformational changes in functional mo-
tions (Pandini et al., 2010). To this purpose, we developed a
structural alphabet (SA): a set of 25 canonical states of four-
residue protein fragments (Cu atoms only) describing the most
probable local conformations in high-resolution protein struc-
tures. Therefore, the SA provides a means for the coarse-grained
annotation and processing of local conformations in a string

format, which lends itself to a range of efficient sequence analysis
algorithms.

The SA has been used successfully in analyzing local changes
in implicit solvent simulations (Kleinjung et al., 2012), allosteric
signal transmission (Pandini et al., 2012) and conformational
changes on effector binding (Baussand and Kleinj ung, 2012).

Here, we present GSATools, a set of SA-related tools inter-
facing with GROMACS (Pronk et al., 2013) for the analysis of
conformational ensembles. GSATools is a software package de-
signed for the investigation of the conformational dynamics of
local structures, the functional correlations between local and
global motions and the mechanisms of allosteric communication.

2 IMPLEMENTATION AND FUNCTIONALITY

GSATools was implemented in C as a set of analysis programs
for GROMACS 4.0.x (Van Der Spoel et al., 2005) and 4.5.x
(Pronk et al., 2013) with a user-friendly and familiar interface.
The required input is a trajectory ﬁle with a reference structure of
the protein in PDB format. The trajectory can be composed of
conformers derived by MD or other simulation methods. The
analysis is performed at the C“ level so that ensembles from one-
bead coarse-grained methods are also suitable input.

The requirement to install GSATools is a working installation
of GROMACS. GSATools comprises the g_sa_enc0de pro-
gram to encode a protein trajectory into an alignment of struc-
tural strings and to perform basic statistical analysis, and the
g_sa_analyze program to perform correlation analysis. The soft-
ware distribution includes exemplary R (R-Development Core
Team, 2010) scripts to directly generate figures and plots from
the output files. In addition to standard R libraries, some scripts
require the Bio3D package (Grant et al., 2006).

2.1 SA encoding and analysis of local motions

The dynamics of local structures is captured by comparison of
the sampled conformations with a set of representative backbone
fragments (Pandini et al., 2010). The conformation of a protein
of n residues is condensed in a structural string of length 11-3
(Pandini et al., 2007); therefore, an MD ensemble containing m
conformers can be encoded into a set of m aligned structural
strings. This structural alphabet (SA) alignment can be saved
in FASTA format for further sequence-oriented analyses.

The g_sa_enc0de program provides two modes of encoding
[local and global (Park and Levitt, 1995)] and yields several

statistics metrics about the encoded trajectory. The user can Visu-
alize the time evolution of structural changes by a color-coded
representation of the alignment (Fig. 1A). Additionally, the
accuracy of the encoding can be measured and plotted for in-
spection. The extent of conformational variability at each pos-
ition can be estimated by the Shannon entropy, and the relative
frequency of the representative fragments at each position can be
saved as a sequence profile of the alignment. Example graphs of
these statistics are included in the Supplementary Data.

The condensed string representation and the sequence statis-
tics are particularly suitable to detect subtle conformational
changes often hidden by analyses of global structure and
dynamics (Pandini et al., 2012).

2.2 Analysis of correlated local motions and allostery

The correlation between local conformational changes of two
fragments in a protein can be calculated as the mutual informa-
tion (MI) between two columns (positions) in the SA alignment.
The MI matrix (Fig. 1B) of all pairwise correlations is a concise
representation of a protein’s local motions (Pandini et al., 2012).
The correlation analysis is performed using the g_sa_analyze on
the SA alignment. The program calculates the positional MI
matrix and estimates the statistical significance of each correl-
ation. Additionally, a transition probability matrix can be calcu-
lated to estimate the relative frequency of speciﬁc fragment
transitions.

A network model of the local motions can be derived from the
normalized MI matrix. The software distribution includes an R
script to output a GML file for Visualization in Cytoscape
(Shannon et al., 2003) and a PyMOL (Schrddinger, 2009) plug-
in to project the network onto the protein structure (Fig. 1C).

Key protein fragments can be identiﬁed by eigenvector cen-
trality (Newman, 2010) within the correlation network using a
provided R script. Nodes with higher network centrality repre-
sent fragments that show correlated motions preferentially with
other highly correlated fragments (Fig. ID).

If the protein of interest has an allosteric function, communi-
cation pathways between the allosteric and orthosteric sites can
be extracted from the network model as shown in Figure 1E
(Pandini et al., 2012).

2.3 Detection of local motions correlated to function

Functionally relevant motions can be identified if a function-
related structural property is known. Generally, global or collect-
ive motions are considered for this type of analysis (Hub and De
Groot, 2009). In the GSATools approach, the g_sa_analyze
scans the protein to detect contributions to a functional change
by local motions.

Any time-dependent index of a function-related property can
be provided. Then the g_sa_analyze program can calculate the
correlation (as MI) between the functional index and each pro-
tein fragment (Fig. 1F). The MI value is eventually used as a
score to predict putative regions of the protein for further ana-
lysis, e.g. site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 1G).

The functional index may be represented by a collective
motion known to be associated with a biological mechanism
(Pandini et al., 2012). In this special case, the analysis can iden-
tify local structures (e. g. hinges) whose motion is propagated to
trigger a functional change on a global scale.

2.4 Tutorial

The software distribution includes a step-by-step tutorial
(Supplementary Data) with input ﬁles, output files, shell scripts
and R scripts. The scripts can easily be modiﬁed to process user-
provided input data.

3 CONCLUSIONS

GSATools is a free, easy-to-use and fully documented software
for the analysis of conformational ensembles of proteins. The
GSATools complements the GROMACS toolkit with a power-
ful set of analyses to detect, annotate and interpret local motions
of functional relevance.

Dynamics of local structures, functional correlations of local
and global motions and mechanisms of allosteric communication
can be extracted from ensembles of conformations. An example
of a comprehensive analysis is provided in the software distribu-
tion; each analysis can be performed independently if desired.
Results are generated in standard formats for easy comparison
with other analyses aimed at identiﬁcation of global motions, i.e.
principal component analysis (Amadei et al., 1993).

GSATools addresses the need for automated functional ana-
lysis emerging from the wealth of molecular simulations
currently available in the scientiﬁc community.

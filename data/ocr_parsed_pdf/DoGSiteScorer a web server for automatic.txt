ABSTRACT

Motivation: Many drug discovery projects fail because the
underlying target is finally found to be undruggable. Progress
in structure elucidation of proteins now opens up a route to
automatic structure-based target assessment. DoGSiteScorer is
a newly developed automatic tool combining pocket prediction,
characterization and druggability estimation and is now available
through a web server.

Availability: The DoGSiteScorer web server is freely available for
academic use at http://dogsite.zbh.uni-hamburg.de

1 INTRODUCTION

Rating the attractiveness of a drug target is one of the major
challenges in the early stages of drug discovery. Besides attractivity
assessment based on medical rationale and commercial viability,
the properties of the target and its ability to be modulated by small
drug-like compounds (ﬁirther referred to as druggability) have to be
analyzed. Due to the large amount of available crystal structures,
the automatic collection of target information gains importance.

In a ﬁrst step, binding pockets have to be detected on the protein
surface. Some methods fulﬁlling this task are available through
web services, e.g. QSite-Finder, CASTp, SCREEN, PocketDepth,
MetaPocket and Fpocket (servers are referenced in Schmidtke
et a1. 2010). The next step on the path toward target classiﬁcation
or druggability prediction is the annotation and comparison of
target-speciﬁc pocket properties. Some servers exist that allow—
besides binding site prediction—for their analysis and ﬁinctional
classiﬁcation, e.g. FINDSITE (Brylinski and Skolnick, 2008),
SplitPocket (Tseng et al., 2009), fPOP (Tseng et al., 2010), ProBis
(Konc and Janezic, 2010) and SiteComp (Lin et al., 2012). Many of
these approaches search for structural similarities, which can help
to predict side effects of known drugs or to identify the role of yet
uncharacterized proteins.

Although methods for fully automatic structure-based drugga-
bility predictions such as SiteMap (Halgren, 2009), Fpocket
(Schmidtke and Barril, 2010) and DLID (Sheridan et al., 2010) exist,
none of these methods is available online for predictions on new
targets. Fpocket allocates a web service where druggability scores
and information can be requested (Schmidtke and Barril, 2010) but
only for precalculated data points.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

DoGSiteScorer (Volkamer et al., 2012) provides the ﬁinctionality
to detect potential binding pockets and subpockets of a protein
of interest. Subsequently, it analyzes the geometric and physico-
chemical properties of these pockets and estimates druggability with
aid of a support vector machine (SVM). DoGSiteScorer has been
evaluated on a large dataset containing 1069 structures and shows
prediction accuracies of 88%. Thus, the method provides valuable
information for target assessment and can now be accessed through
a web server.

2 METHODS

The ﬁrst step in the DoGSiteScorer procedure is the prediction of potential
pockets on the protein surface solely based on the protein heavy atom
coordinates. A grid is spanned around the protein and grid points are labeled
depending on their spatial overlap with any protein atom. Subsequently,
a difference of Gaussian (DOG) ﬁlter is applied to the grid. With this
operation, positions on the protein surface are identiﬁed where the location of
a sphere-like object is favorable. Based on a density threshold, these positions
are clustered to potential subpockets. Finally, neighboring subpockets are
merged to pockets. (Volkamer at al., 2010)

Several geometric and physico-chemical properties are automatically
calculated for the predicted pockets and subpockets. Pocket volume and
surface are calculated by counting the grid points constituting the pocket
volume or its surface and multiplying this number with the grid box
volume or surface, respectively. A breadth-ﬁrst search is used for pocket
depth computation, starting from the solvent exposed pocket parts toward
the most deeply buried regions. Ellipsoids ﬁtted into the pocket volume
reﬂect the overall pocket shape. The pocket enclosure is derived from
the ratio between pocket hull and surface grid points. Each atom within
4A of any pocket point is considered a pocket atom. Pocket atom counts
or functional groups and amino acid compositions describe the physico-
chemical features of the pocket. Furthermore, the lipophilic character of the
pockets is addressed by the lipophilic surface and the overall hydrophobicity
ratio. In addition, if a ligand is provided, the overlap between ligand and
pocket volume is computed. Moreover, a SimpleScore is calculated by a
linear combination of the three properties pocket volume, enclosure and
lipophilic character.

For druggability predictions, a supervised machine learning technique-
more precisely a SVM-is incorporated. Based on a discriminate analysis,
a subset of descriptors best suited to separate druggable from undruggable
pockets has been selected. The model has been trained and tested on the non-
redundant version of the druggable dataset (Schmidtke and Barril, 2010).
External cross validation, randomly taking one half of the data as training
and the other half as test set, showed a mean accuracy of 90%. (Volkamer
at al. , 2012)

For each input structure, the method predicts potential pockets, describes
them through descriptors and queries the SVM model for druggability
estimations. A druggability score between 0 and 1 is returned. The higher
the score the more druggable the pocket is estimated to be.

3 USAGE AND OUTPUT

The DoGSiteScorer server requires a PDB code or a user-speciﬁed
PDB ﬁle as input. To calculate the ligand/pocket overlap, the ligand
can be extracted from the structure or provided as mol2 ﬁle. Further,
format speciﬁcations can be obtained through an info button. After
a validity check, the user can select if the entire protein or a selected
chain should be used. DoGSiteScorer can be customized to work
on the pocket and subpocket level. In addition, the druggability
estimation for pockets can be switched on. Clicking the ‘calculate
and analyze pockets’ button leads to the result page (Fig. 1).

On the left side, a table containing volume, surface, lipophilic
surface and depth of each detected pocket or subpocket is shown.
The rows are sorted by descending pocket volume. The last table
column either holds the calculated SimpleScore or the druggability
score. The druggability score ﬁelds are colored according to the
druggability character of the pockets based on a trafﬁc light coloring
scheme (green: high druggability score, red: low druggability score).
Note that the subpocket druggability scores do not add up to the
respective pocket score. Both pocket and subpocket scores are
calculated with individual druggability models, trained on pockets
and subpockets, respectively. For a quick visual analysis, the
predicted pockets and subpockets as well as protein and ligand are
shown in a J mol applet (http://www.jmol.org/). The color code used
for the pocket representation corresponds to the background color
of the respective entry in the pocket descriptor table. Pockets can
individually be displayed or hidden. Thus, the user can explore the
neighborhood of a pocket of interest and e.g. investigate potential
extensions toward highly ranked (sub)pockets.

Further, pocket properties can be accessed in a separate table by
clicking on the name of a pocket. If a ligand is contained in the
pocket, the respective ligand and pocket coverage are annotated.
The descriptor information is provided in ﬁve tables, partitioned
based on the descriptor category. The shape and size table contains
volume, surface, lipophilic surface and depth of the pocket, ratios
between ellipsoid main axes and pocket enclosure. Information
about ﬁinctional groups such as number of hydrogen bond donors
and acceptors, metals and hydrophobic interactions as well as the
hydrophobicity ratio is presented in the next table. Pocket atom

and speciﬁc element counts are provided in the third table. Finally,
information about amino acids is spread over the last two tables
containing the ratio of apolar, polar, positive and negative amino
acids as well as the occurrence of each of the 20 amino acids,
respectively. All information and data (descriptor and PDB ﬁles for
pocket lining residues) can be received through email.

As a use case, the tyrosine protein kinase Abll (cALB) with
its inhibitor Gleevec (imatinib) is exemplarily shown (PDB code
1iep-chain B). DoGSiteScorer detects seven potential pockets on
the surface of the protein structure, listed in the result table and
visualized with Jmol (Fig. 1). The ﬁrst three pockets are estimated
to be druggable. The selection of the pocket with the highest
druggability of 0.81 opens a detailed descriptor page. The anti-
cancer drug imatinib is completely contained in the detected pocket
and ﬁlls the pocket to 35.7%. A large pocket volume of 1466 A3, a
high depth of 19.27 A as well as a high apolar amino acid ratio of 0.5
are only three properties of this pocket that generally characterize
druggable pockets. Since the detected pocket is rather large, the
analysis based on subpocket level may provide a more realistic view
on the ATP-binding site. The largest subpocket POSPO achieves a
druggability score of 0.89, contains the drug completely and is 50%
covered. The other three subpockets are rather small pieces that are
cutoff at the edges of the original pocket and get druggability scores
below 0.43.

4 CONCLUSION

DoGSiteScorer web server provides an easy to use interface
to predict pockets and subpockets of a protein structure of
interest. Furthermore, key properties characterizing the pocket and
druggability estimations are supplied.

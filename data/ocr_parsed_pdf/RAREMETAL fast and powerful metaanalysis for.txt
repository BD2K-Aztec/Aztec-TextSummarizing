ABSTRACT

Summary: RAREMETAL is a computationally efficient tool for meta-
analysis of rare variants genotyped using sequencing or arrays.
RAREMETAL facilitates analyses of individual studies, accommodates
a variety of input file formats, handles related and unrelated individ-
uals, executes both single variant and burden tests and performs con-
ditional association analyses.

1 INTRODUCTION

In genomewide association studies, meta-analysis has been key in
establishing association between common variants and complex
traits (Willer et al., 2010). Recent advances in exome sequencing
and the development of exome genotyping arrays are enabling
complex disease studies to explore association between rare vari-
ants of clear functional consequence and complex traits. For
these rare variants, single variant tests can lack power, and as-
sociation tests that group rare variants by gene or functional unit
are favored (Li and Leal, 2008; Lin and Tang, 2011; Madsen and
Browning, 2009; Price et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2011).

Here, we describe a tool for meta-analysis of rare variant
association studies for quantitative traits. Our tool enables indi-
vidual studies to account for study-speciﬁc covariates as well as
family and population structure. In addition, it generates sum-
maries of linkage disequilibrium information that allow associ-
ation tests for groups of rare variants during meta-analysis.

2 METHODS

The key idea in our implementation is that gene-level test statistics can be
reconstructed from single variant score statistics and that, when the link-
age disequilibrium relationships between variants are known, the distri-
bution of gene-level statistics can be derived to evaluate signiﬁcance.

Several other tools to support rare variant meta-analysis are now avail-
able (Lee et al., 2013; Lumley et al., 2012; Tang and Lin, 2013; Voorman
et al., 2013). We have tried to complement these tools by adding support
for modeling of related individuals and the X chromosome, additional
QC statistics, directly using compressed ﬁles to facilitate sharing and im-
plementing conditional analyses to disentangle the contributions of
nearby variants, common or rare.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

RAREMETAL works in two steps. The ﬁrst step, implemented in
RAREMETALWORKER (RMW), analyzes individual studies and gen-
erates summary statistics that can later be combined across studies. This
step can account for relatedness among individuals or hidden population
structure using a variance component approach, based on either a kinship
matrix estimated from pedigree (Abecasis et al., 2002) or a genomic re-
lationship matrix estimated from marker data (Kang et al., 2010; Lippert
et al., 2011). When chromosome X is analyzed, an additional variance
component is used to describe kinship for X-linked markers.

RMW tabulates single variant score statistics, which summarize
evidence for association, together with covariance matrices, which sum-
marize linkage disequilibrium relationships among variants (see our
online documentation for methods http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/
RAREMETALWORKER_METHOD). RMW also tabulates quality
control statistics for traits and covariates (mean, standard deviation
and number of phenotyped samples) and marker genotypes (Hardyi
Weinberg Equilibrium P-values and genotype missing rate). These can
be used to identify problematic markers and studies during meta-analysis.

Meta-analysis is implemented in a separate tool, RAREMETAL,
which calculates gene-level burden tests (either weighted or unweighed),
variable frequency threshold tests and sequence kernel association
tests (SKAT) (Liu et al., 2014). Key formulae can be found in
our online documentation (http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/RARE
METAL_METHOD).

RAREMETAL can also use variancewovariance matrices to perform
conditional analyses that distinguish true signals from the shadows of
signiﬁcant variants nearby.

3 RESULTS

One of our primary considerations in RAREMETAL was sup-
port for standard, easy-to-implement input formats. RMW uses
Merlin format input files (Abecasis et al., 2002) to retrieve
phenotypes, covariates and family structure and VCF files to
retrieve genotypes (Danecek et al., 2011). Checks are imple-
mented for a variety of problems in input ﬁles, including format-
ting errors, X-linked genotypes that are inconsistent with
reported sex and matching of identiﬁers across ﬁles.

RMW and RAREMETAL are implemented in C+ +. Source
code and binary executables are available from our web site. For
convenience, input and output ﬁles can be processed directly in
GZIP format. We have also tested compilation on several Linux,
MAC OS X and Windows platforms.

3.1 Usage

RMW and RAREMETAL runs can be customized through
command line parameters. These allow users to specify
whether phenotypes should be quantile normalized, whether
covariates should be modeled, whether population and/or
family structure should be controlled using variance compo-
nents, the size of linkage disequilibrium matrices to be shared

A unique feature of RAREMETAL is the ability to customize
variant groupings for gene-level statistics at the meta-analysis
stage, after individual studies are analyzed. RAREMETAL
generates separate reports for each gene-level test with de-
tailed information. QQ and Manhattan plots can be generated
by RMW and RAREMETAL directly (see Fig. l for example).

RAREMETAL is already being used in large meta-analyses
of rare variants for a variety of traits, ranging from blood lipids
levels, anthropometric traits to smoking and drinking.

3.2 Performance

Using RMW, generating per study statistics in a recent analysis of
exome array genotypes at 238000 markers in 2000 individuals
required between ~9.lmin (unrelated samples) and ~26.8 min
(using genomic relationship). Using RAREMETAL, meta-
analysis of 23 studies (sample size of ~51000) required
~40min to produce single variant and all available gene-level
association test results across ~18 000 genes.

3.3 Comparison to other tools

When analyzing ~6000 unrelated individuals at ~100 000 mar-
kers, RMW/RAREMETAL provides a speed improvement of
~600—fold compared with SCORESEQ/MASS (Tang and Lin,
2013). This difference in speed increases with sample size and
number of studies. The R package metaSKAT (Lee et at,
2013) provides comparably fast computations, but variable
threshold test is not provided. An important difference between
RAREMETAL and these published tools is the ability to use
linear mixed models to account for sample relatedness and/0r
population structure. Even when using linear mixed models to
account for relatedness and population structure, RMW can
handle large datasets. A mixed model analysis of 10000

individuals at 238 000 markers used 6.1h and 2GB memory.
With 12 GB memory, RMW was able to analyze 23 000 individ-
uals in <5 days. Other features in RAREMETAL unique to
other published tools are the ﬂexibility of changing gene deﬁn-
itions and grouping strategies after individual studies have been
analyzed and the ability to perform conditional meta-analysis.

In contrast to popular single variant meta-analysis methods,
such as implemented in METAL (Willer et at, 2010), our new
approach is expected to provide more power for analysis of rare
variants (Liu et at, 2014). We hope RAREMETAL will accel-
erate the discovery of trait-associated rare variants, leading to
insights into human biology.

values using recently published exome data from 31 cancer cell
lines (Abaan et al., 2013), 16 breast (Banerji et al., 2012), 16
prostate (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2008)
and 17 glioblastoma cancer patients (The Cancer Genome Atlas
Research Network, 2008). We also study the effects of the exist—
ence of subclonal populations or segmentation errors on the ac—
curacy of the purity estimation. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work that has provided a working pipeline to
estimate purity, ploidy and absolute copy numbers from raw
WES data, which has been validated on several independently
published WES datasets. We implemented the algorithm in an R
package called absCNseq that is freely available from our Web
site (http://biostats.mcc.ucsd.edu/ﬁles/absCNseq_1.0.tar.gz).

2 METHODS

2.1 Exome sequencing datasets and post-alignment
processing pipeline

2.1.1 N C160 cell line dataset The NCI60 tumor cell lines from mul-
tiple tissues of origin have long been used for in vitro anticancer drug
screening, and their molecular and cellular characteristics have been well
studied by a variety of biological assays. In particular, they have been
individually karyotyped by the spectral karyotyping (SKY) assay
(Roschke et al., 2003). Just recently, the majority of these cell lines also
had their exomes sequenced (Abaan et al., 2013); hence, this represents
an ideal validation dataset for our ploidy inference. We used the SKY-
determined modal ploidy as the reference ploidy value and compared our
ploidy estimates with these reference values.

2.1.2 dbGAP breast cancer dataset We obtained published data
from paired breast tumor-normal samples, which had both SNP array
data (Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0) and WES data
(Illumina GA II, average coverage 100x) (Banerji et al., 2012). Published
estimates of purity and ploidy were available for these samples using
ABSOLUTE on the SNP array data. We downloaded the aligned read
ﬁles (BAM ﬁles) from dbGAP (Mailman et al., 2007) under the study
number phs000369.v1.p1 for the ﬁrst 23 Mexican subjects (BR-M-OOS
through BR-M-OSS) in the published Supplementary Table S2 (Banerji
et al., 2012). We extracted the experimental information from the BAM
ﬁle headers. We excluded seven subjects from further analysis because the
sequencing date for the matched germ line and tumor samples were in
different weeks, and thus must have been in different sequencing runs.
The remaining 16 subjects all had the matched samples sequenced in the
same week. Interestingly, we found that the mean coverage ratio across
the genome recapitulated our inclusion/exclusion rule almost perfectly:
the mean coverage ratios are all close to 1.0 for the samples we included,
and obviously further away from 1.0 for the excluded samples
(Supplementary Table S2). This supports our selection of samples for
this analysis, as it implies that there may exist systematic bias between
different sequencing batches.

2.1.3 T CGA tumor dataset We selected two representative tumor
types (prostate and glioblastoma) from the TCGA database (The
Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2008). We downloaded the
WES data for 20 random samples per each tumor type. We compared
the purity and ploidy estimates by our method with those by the
ABSOLUTE method.

2.1.4 Processing pipeline The ﬂowchart of absCN-seq is shown in
Supplementary Figure S1. For all the WES data, the BAM ﬁles (Li et al.,
2009) have been realigned, deduplicated and recalibrated. We used sam-
tools (version 0.1.18) (Li et al., 2009) to count the number of total reads

that were properly paired and aligned in each BAM ﬁle, and used this as
a normalization constant to compare the coverage depth between the
paired tumor and germ line DNA samples. We then used varscan2 (ver-
sion 2.3.2) (Koboldt et al., 2012) to compute the ratio of coverage be-
tween the paired tumor/normal DNA samples for each bin, with bins
determined by varscan2. The bin size was 5100 bp. We used the
DNAcopy package (Olshen et al., 2004) to perform copy number seg-
mentation. Segments <200 bp in length were excluded because short seg-
ments are likely caused by technical artifacts. In addition to calling copy
number ratios, the varscan2 software also outputs a set of high-conﬁ-
dence somatic SNVs in the tumor exome. We computed the observed
allele frequencies for these somatic SNVs, which provide orthogonal
purity information to copy number variation. We included both the seg-
mented copy ratio information and the SNV allele frequencies in our
objective function to be optimized, as described later in the text.

2.2 Statistical framework

2.2.1 Basic notation and description of the sequencing data The
input data for AbsCN-seq are a set of N segmented genomic intervals and
their accompanying observed read depths, for matched germ line and
tumor samples. If the segmentation algorithm is correct, then the
tumor cells have constant copy number on each segment. A segment
may be clonal, in that all tumor cells share the same copy number for
the segment, or subclonal, in that there are two or more subpopulations of
tumor cells with different, but constant, copy numbers on the segment. In
addition, the tumor sample is composed of mixed cancer and stromal
cells, where the stromal cells contain germ line DNA and the cancer cells
contain DNA with somatic mutations, including the copy number aber-
rations considered here.

Let the ith genomic segment be w,- base pairs in length, and let I be the
read length. On the ith segment, the tumor sample has total aligned read
count ti,» and corresponding read depth X,» = [tn/m», with total aligned
reads in the sample given by T, = 1 tn. Similarly, let the germ line
read depth be denoted by y,» 2 It!“ [/wi, with total read count in the germ
line sample Tg. Let n,» = E[y,»]/2 be the haploid mean read depth for
segment i for the germ line sample, given that total read depth is Tg;
thus, 7],» is the mean read depth expected from each homologous chromo-
some in the germ line sample for this segment. Note that the 7],» capture
variation in aligned read depth at different locations in the genome due to
sequencing bias, which may arise, for example, from varying GC content
in the genomic segment, differences in mappability for repetitive regions,
differences in capture efﬁciency of probes in the case of targeted sequen-
cing, or PCR bias in the ampliﬁcation step. If there is no sequencing bias,
so that coverage is expected to be uniform, then 7],» E n for all segments 1'.
We assume that for every segment i expected read depth is strictly pro-
portional to total read count, so that 2niT,/Tg is the mean read depth
that would be expected from the germ line sample at total read count T,
rather than Tg.

2.2.2 Purity (at) and ploidy (1,“) Let at be the purity of the tumor
sample, that is, the proportion of cancer cells in the tumor sample. Let 1"
represent the average genomic ploidy for the tumor sample, that is, twice
the ratio of the average amount of genomic DNA per cancer cell relative
to the total DNA within a stromal cell, so that t" = 2 for a tumor with no
copy number aberrations. Then in the tumor sample, the ratio of cancer
to stromal DNA will be on" : 2(1 — or), and the proportion of DNA in the
sample from the cancer cells, p’, will be

p’ E elf/(ozr’ + 2(1 — 01)).

2.2.3 Segment copy number, qi First, consider a clonal segment, so
that all the cancer cells have identical genomes for this segment. The
biologic model is that for each of the two homologous chromosomes,
maternal and paternal, the DNA sequence represented by interval 1'

 

1 057

ﬁm'spzumofpmjxo'sopnuuopnorq/pdnq

L.Bao et al.

 

appears once in each germ line cell (copy number 2) and an integral
number of times in each cancer cell, am» times for the maternal copy
and an,» times for the paternal copy. Then the copy number in the tumor
for the segment is q,» 2 am,» + am, which is an integer. For a subclonal
segment, a,- is the average copy number over the differing cancer cell
populations that form the tumor subclones, and so may not be an integer.
It is important to note that segmentation errors can also cause a,- to not be
an integer, with a,- then deﬁned to be the average copy number over the w,-
bases comprising genomic segment i.

To relate copy number to genomic ploidy, note that qiw,» is the total
number of base pairs of DNA from genomic segment iper tumor cell and
2w,» the corresponding number for a germ line cell, so that the relative
copy number q,» / 2 gives the ratio of total DNA from a cancer cell relative
to a normal cell for this segment. Then total genomic DNA in an average
tumor cell is given by Z qiwl», and so twice the ratio of tumor to germ line
DNA is given by i

/ Ziv QiWi
N

r = —.
Z,» w,»

However, 1" may not reﬂect the proportion of aligned reads captured

from tumor relative to germ line cells because the capture efﬁciency of

the sequencing may differ between genomic segments, as represented by

the parameters 7],». Hence, we deﬁne the sequencing ploidy r as

_  qt’WiTh (1)

Of the T, total aligned reads from the tumor sample, pT, are expected to
be from the tumor and (1 — p) T, from stroma, with

p =ar/(ar+2(l —Ol)). (2)

1'

2.2.4 A copy—numberibased ratio estimator Expected read depth
for segment i in the tumor sample, E[X,»], can be expressed in terms of
purity or, copy number a,- and expected germ line depth E[y,»] = 7],». First,
the total read count in the tumor sample, overall and in segment i, is the
sum of reads from stromal cells, denoted with subscript s, and from
cancer cells, denoted by c, that is,

T! = To + Tv

[m = [c.i + [Ll-

The total stromal reads TY are not observed, but are equal to (1 — p) T,.
They will distribute across the genomic segments in expected proportion
to 2niwi/ T , so that for each segment the expected number of stromal
reads in the tumor sample is given by the following equation:

Elﬁjl = ZniWi(Tt/Tg)(1 — P)-

On segment i, the cancer to stromal DNA is in the ratio
aq,»:(2(l —Ol)), so that, assuming equal capture efﬁciency for the
cancer and stromal DNA within the segment,

Ella] = Elli. [lath/(2(1 — 01))-
Combining these expressions,

Elfin] = 277iWi(Tt/Tg)(1 - p)(1 + “qt/(2(1 - 01))-

at61t+2(1—Ol)

Let R =(T,/Tg). Then,
aq,»+2(l —Ol)

RilEllml/Ellml = RTIEIXil/ED/i] = (3)

ar+2(l —oi)'

Equation (3) suggests use of a ratio estimator based on the normalized
ratio of means r,» = R’lxi/y,» to estimate the parameters of interest or and
q,-, and thus 1'.

2.2.5 An SN Vfrequencrbased estimator Suppose segment 1’ con-
tains one or more loci with an SNV, and let m(i) be the total number of
SNVs on the segment, and j}, j = 1 . . .m(1), be the corresponding
observed variant allele proportions out of the total aligned reads from
the tumor sample, for each of the SNVs. By similar arguments as above,
the expected SNV allele frequency may be estimated by the following:
N 01in
Em] N oral» + 2(1 — or) (4)

where sf is the absolute copy number of the somatic allele at locus j.
Because up to q,- copies of tumor DNA may carry the mutation,
Sj 5 q,». Therefore, the observed allele frequencies can also be used to
estimate or and q,-.

2.3 The least squares objective function

The least squares objective function is given by the sum of two terms, one
containing information about read depth, and the other about variant
allele frequency,

‘ aqi+2(l —a) 2
0:0 _ ar+2(l —oz))

m(i) - 2

and is to be minimized over the non-negative integers sf 5 q,» and
or e [0, 1]. As in Section 2.2 above, on segment i, r,- is the observed nor-
malized copy number ratio and r,» = R’lxi/yl», and  is the observed
variant allele frequency for each of the m(i) SNVs residing in segment i.
If there is no SNV in that segment, then 2 sf 2 0. The relative import-
ance of these two parts is given by the weight parameter A e (0, 1). When
A = 1, the objective function reduces to the simple case where only the
copy number information is used. In this work, we assessed A21 and
A = 0.5 (equal weights).

2.4 Estimation algorithm

We propose an iterative estimation scheme in which we maximize each
parameter in turn, cycling through the parameters. Initially, we assume
q,» 6 {0,1, ...,Q}, so that all segments are clonal with maximum copy
number Q. The purity or is constrained to lie in the interval [0,1]. Step 0 is
an initialization step; steps 1 and 2 are iterated to convergence (relative
changes in objective function <1e-4).

Step 0: Set 77,» = y,». Initialize (2(0) and rm).
Step 1: Assume all intervals are clonal. For each i, set a)“ to solve
a)“ = arg min

NEH). ....q;}

Note that the q’s and s’s are available in closed form, as this step only
requires rounding the right-hand term inside the absolute value sign to

the nearest integer. Here we have dropped the dependence of sf on i for
convenience.

Step 2: Given the estimates {qgkl}, {sjkl} and I“), use the non-linear least
square method to ﬁnd 0M“) that minimizes the objective function (5).

2.4.1 Grid search over initial values and ‘no estimate’ results This
integer optimization problem converges quickly. As with many integer
valued maximization problems, the algorithm may ﬁnd a local optimum,
depending on the initial values of oz and 1'. Hence, we use a grid search
strategy over the starting values (2(0) and rm) to ﬁnd the global optimum
of the objective function.

We initiate the core algorithm described above over a grid of starting
values of purity (ranging from 0.20 to 0.95 with an increment of 0.05) and
ploidy (ranging from 1.5 to 5.0 with an increment of 0.05). The set of
local maxima found at convergence is inspected and ﬁltered. Solutions
that occur only from a single starting value (i.e. solutions that do not
recur from multiple initialization points) are removed, as well as biologic-
ally implausible solutions (i.e. solutions outside the search range, e.g. with
purity 0 or 100%). From the remaining set of stable solutions, the par-
ameter set {qi, or, r} with the minimum mean-squared error is returned as
the optimal estimate of copy number, purity and ploidy. Our method
returns no estimate if the ﬁltration results in no solution. The stable
solution set can be retained for further inspection, as there may be
more than one solution with nearly equal values of the objective function.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Performance on simulated data

We used two simulation studies, the ﬁrst to assess the accuracy
and the second to assess robustness of our estimates of purity.
We based our simulated data on the empirically observed data in
our samples. We randomly chose sample BR—M—028 as a model.

3.1.1 Accuracy For the ﬁrst study, to generate the data, we
obtained empirical values for the N segment lengths w,- from
sample BR—M—028. We used the estimated segment integer
copy numbers (1,. We then computed the true ploidy using
Equation (1). We generated r,-’s from NUMUZ) where m was
computed using Equation (3) with a fixed at 0.3, 0.5 or 0.7,
and 02 = 0.1 fixed at the value obtained empirically from
cancer sample BR—M—028. Thus, these data model a tumor
sample with true known values of a, ‘L' and (1,. We used a simu—
lation size of 50, to be consistent with the more extensive simu—
lation of robustness reported later in the text. Notably, to assess
worst—case performance of the algorithm, we did not apply the
ﬁltering, which yields a ‘no call’ result, as described in Section
2.4.1, but instead report the values found by the optimization
routine. Thus, most of the extreme values reported here would
instead be ‘no call’ results.

Table 1 shows that the method appears to be unbiased; at all
purity levels, the median of the estimates are near the true values.
When the tumor purity is moderate to high (5&70%), the vari—
ability appears to be low, with interquartile range of 0.03 at 50%
purity and 0.02 at 70% purity. However, when tumor purity is
low (30%), while the median estimate is still close to the true
value, the 95% percentile estimate is much larger, demonstrating
increased variability. This is expected because in low purity sam—
ples, the signal (tumor cell) to noise (stromal contamination)
ratio is much lower, and finding the correct unique solution be—
comes more challenging.

0.50 0.50 0.45 0.47 0.50 0.53
0.70 0.69 0.66 0.68 0.70 0.71

 

3.1.2 Robustness For the second study, we used the same data
as above, but allowed the qi to be non—integer. Recall that qi is
the true average copy number for the ith genomic segment; qi will
fall between integer values if there is an error in the segmentation
algorithm, so that copy number is not constant across the seg—
ment, or if the tumor contains two or more subclonal mixtures of
cells with different copy numbers, so that read depth is averaged
from the two subclonal populations. Each of these circumstances
is likely to hold for at least a fraction of the genomic segments
that are fed into AbsCN—Seq.

To model non—integer copy numbers, we used the same basic
simulation setup as above. However, here we designated a frac—
tion n/N of segments to be non—integer, with n varying from 0 to
N /2. We chose N /2 as the upper limit because we thought it
unlikely that more than half of segments would be impacted
by a copy number event, which was either poorly estimated by
the segmentation algorithm or was impacted by a difference be—
tween subclones. For each simulated dataset, we then randomly
selected a subset of n segments, and for these, we set the true
copy number to be a random draw from the uniform distribution
U((1i — 0.5, q,~ + 0.5). For each subclonal fraction n/N and purity
a, we simulated 50 different r,-’s. We then applied AbsCN—seq to
the simulated r,-’s and assessed the deviation from the true under—
lying or as the subclonal fraction increases. Again, we did not
ﬁlter out any ‘no call’ solutions, and so we forced the method
to produce an estimate in all 50 cases.

Figure 1 depicts the effects of the presence of subclonal seg—
ments or incorrect segmentation (i.e. non—integer (1,) on the esti—
mated purity. The X—axis is the proportion of segments that are
non—integer, and varies from 0, which is the case reported in
Table 1, to 50%. The boxplots on the Y—axis show the estimated
purity for each of 50 simulated datasets. True purity is shown by
the horizonal line. We did not filter out ‘no calls’. In practice,
many of the extreme estimates of purity shown here would be
replaced by ‘no estimate’. At least some of the outliers seen in
Figure 1 (and in particular, all of the estimates with a = 1) were
due to this ‘no filtration’ strategy. It can be seen that the esti—
mated purity is most accurate when the percentage of subclonal
segments is <30%. As the proportion of segments with non—in—
teger qfs increases (e.g. >30%), our method tends to underesti—
mate tumor purity, and the bias is larger when the true purity is
higher. However, even in the ‘worst’ case, at 70% purity and with
50% of segments impacted by segmentation errors or subclonal
copy number events, the median estimated purity is ~66% and
almost all estimates (90%) are between 58 and 73%. Hence, even
in this extreme case, our method appears to give reasonably good
and practically useful estimates, although they are somewhat

duce some bias, but estimated purity remains reasonable

biased toward lower purity in the presence of segmentation
errors.

3.2 Performance on real data

3.2.1 NCI60 cell line dataset We downloaded WES data for 38
cell lines with the ﬁrst letter from A to P. Unlike the patient
tumor samples, the cell lines do not have their paired germ line
exomes. Therefore, we used the nearly diploid hematopoietic cell
line SR as a common reference for all other cell lines. Seven cell
lines with unreasonably small or large mean coverage ratios were
excluded. We ran our method on the remaining 31 cell lines and
compared our ploidy estimates to the SKY—determined values
(Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S1). Throughout the article,
we recorded the top two solutions in terms of minimum ﬁtting
errors and listed in the tables the one that better matches the
benchmark value. Using this approach, we obtained close ploidy
estimates from the WES data as compared with the SKY bench—
mark values for 29 of 31 (94%) cell lines. The top ﬁrst solutions
and second solutions matched the SKY values for 22 and 7 cell
lines, respectively. Among the two outliers, HOP—92 is known for
presence of a large number of structural rearrangements
(Roschke et al., 2003) that potentially complicated the analysis.
The reason why HCC2998 was the other outlier was unclear to
us. If these two outliers are excluded, the Spearman correlation
coefﬁcient is 0.93 (P<0.0001), the root mean squared error
(RMSE) is 0.16 and the concordance correlation coefficient
(Lin, 1989) is 0.94, indicating high concordance between our
ploidy estimates and the SKY values for most cell lines. If
using only the top ranked solution for all 31 cell lines
(as compared with using 24 first and 7 second solutions as
above), the RMSE is 0.55, similar to the performance of

published SNP—based methods on similar cell lines (Carter
et al., 2012).

3.2.2 dbGAP breast cancer dataset We used a publicly available
exome sequencing dataset from 16 breast cancer patients (Banerji
et al., 2012), which has published estimates of purity and ploidy
from SNP array data using ABSOLUTE (Carter et al., 2012).
ABSOLUTE is a well—established method to estimate purity and
ploidy from SNP array data, and we used its estimates as a gold
standard.

We applied AbsCN—seq, both with and without SNV informa—
tion, to the exome sequencing data and compared the resulting
estimates of purity and ploidy with those of ABSOLUTE
(Table 2). The number of SNVs called in these samples ranges
from 17 to 154. As expected, ploidy estimates are almost the
same for AbsCN—Seq with and without SNV information
unless distinct solutions are selected, as Equation (4) shows
that SNV frequency does not provide direct information about
ploidy. For estimated purity, AbsCN—seq incorporating SNV in—
formation has a higher concordance with ABSOLUTE than
AbsCN—seq without this information. Hence, we will take
AbsCN—seq incorporating SNV information as our default
algorithm.

Overall, the estimates of purity and ploidy from AbsCN—seq
with SNV information have good concordance with
ABSOLUTE (Fig. 3 and Table 2). ABSOLUTE gave no estimate
for three subjects (18.8% no call rate), and AbsCN—seq gave no
estimate for one subject (6.3% no call rate). AbsCN—seq failed to
converge to a biologically plausible solution for subject 27, leav—
ing 12 subjects remaining for comparison. The top ranked ﬁrst
solutions and second solutions matched the ABSOLUTE esti—
mates for 9 and 1 tumors, respectively. Subject BR—M—074 is the
only subject with a large discrepancy in both estimated purity
and ploidy (Fig. 3). ABSOLUTE estimates low purity (0.25) and
high ploidy (3.88), assigning this sample the extreme estimate in
both measures. By comparison, AbsCN—seq approximately

doubles the estimated purity (0.51) and halves the ploidy (1.95),

Thus, ABSOLUTE would appear to infer a whole—genome dou—
bling event, which AbsCN—seq does not. Notably, the
ABSOLUTE solution fits the exome sequencing data poorly
and does not belong to the stable solution set obtained by
AbsCN—seq. Thus, there appears to be a true discrepancy in
estimated purity and ploidy for subject BR—M—074, with
ABSOLUTE providing extreme, and AbsCN—seq mid—range, es—
timates. In particular, the exome sequencing data do not appear
to support a whole—genome doubling event. Hence, we will take
the AbsCN—seq estimate as reasonable for this sample, and omit
it from further comparisons. A second subject, BR—M—038, has
an alternate AbsCN—seq estimate in the stable solution set that
closely matches the ABSOLUTE estimates (purity 0.49 and
ploidy 1.93, shown as an open triangle on Fig. 3b), although
this alternate estimate did not belong to the top two solutions
as measured by the AbsCN—seq objective function. It is plausible
that, for subject BR—M—038, the discrepancy between the two
methods might result from which ABSOLUTE uses an external
database with expected frequency of karyotype information to
adjust the rank of the observed solutions.

Comparing the two series of estimates across all 12 subjects,
the RMSE is 0.20 for purity and 0.35 for ploidy, respectively.
Again, the moderate discrepancy of ploidy estimates is driven
by the outlier subject BR—M—074 discussed earlier in the text.
When this outlier subject is disregarded, the RMSE becomes
0.13 for purity and 0.22 for ploidy, respectively. Averaged over
the 11 samples, the estimated purity for ABSOLUTE is 0.48 and
for AbsCN—seq is 0.52, suggesting that on these samples, the

(exome data) versus ABSOLUTE (SNP array data). The alternate estimate
for BR-M-038 mentioned in the main text is shown as an open triangle

SNP—array7based ABSOLUTE estimates tend to give somewhat
lower estimated purity on average than AbsCN—seq. Estimated
ploidy is similar between the two algorithms, generally within
3%. Recall that the two algorithms are using independent sets
of data, exome sequencing data for AbsCN—seq and SNP array
data for ABSOLUTE, and so this performance appears to be
reasonable.

After determining the most likely purity and ploidy, AbsCN—
seq computed integer copy numbers qi’s and s,’s for each seg—
ment. A typical graphical representation of the CNAs on each
chromosome is shown in Figure 4, for subject BR—M—030 and
chromosome 16.

3.2.3 T CGA tumor dataset To evaluate whether our method
can be applied equally well to different tumor types other than
cell lines and breast tumors, we assessed our method on ~20
prostate and 20 GBM tumor samples from the TCGA database.

in pure tumor cells are in red. As a copy ratio of 1.0 corresponds to a
normal diploid segment. we multiply the copy ratios by two to bring the
copy ratio and the absolute copy number to the same scale

We compared the purity and ploidy estimates by our method
with those from ABSOLUTE. applied to the same data. We
excluded a few samples that ABSOLUTE output marked as
either “high entropy” or “low purity". with 16 prostate and 17
GBM samples remaining for comparison (Fig. 5 and
Supplementary Table S3). Figure 5 shows that the two estimates
are highly concordant over a broad purity and ploidy range. The
Spearman correlation for purity and ploidy is 0.80 (P<0.0001)
and 0.91 (P<0.0001). respectively. and the concordance correl-
ation coefﬁcients are 0.78 and 0.89. respectively. Averaged over
the 33 samples. the estimated purity for ABSOLUTE is 0.581
and for AbsCN-seq is 0.589. We no longer observed the minor
discrepancy we saw in the breast tumor samples. implying that
the minor discrepancy might be induced by the difference be-
tween platforms. Interestingly. the distribution of the ploidy es-
timates for each tumor type (Fig. 5b) recapitulated what was
observed in SNP array data for a larger sample size [cf
Fig. 3c in (Carter el (1].. 2012)]. For example. prostate tumor
ploidy shows a bimodal distribution with peaks at 2.0 and
>35 and few intermediate cases. In contrast. the GBMs tend
to have continuous ploidy in the range from 2.0 to 4.0. This
cross-platform consistent pattern not only substantiates that
our random samples are representative of the larger population.
but also provides additional evidence that our estimates as a
whole are likely reasonable.

4 DISCUSSION

We have developed a statistical approach. AbsCN-seq. which
can estimate tumor purity and ploidy from WES data. and
then use these estimates to infer absolute copy number and ab-
solute multiplicity of somatic SNVs in the tumor. The ploidy

estimates of our method ﬁt the SKY values well. Our method
also has good concordance with ABSOLUTE. although the two
differ in several aspects. First. the input data are generated from
different high-throughput platforms. ABSOLUTE. in it standard
form. using SNP array data while our method takes NGS data.
Second. the statistical framework and implementation differ.
ABSOLUTE uses a Bayesian framework. whereas our method
uses a simpler frequentist approach. Third. ABSOLUTE uses
additional independent information to infer which solution is
most likely. such as empirical karyotype models. while our solu-
tion refers only to the data from the sample and chooses the
estimate that gives the best least-squares ﬁt to the data. Given
these differences. it is encouraging to see the high concordance
between these two methods on our validation datasets. For the
breast cancer patients. ABSOLUTE did not make calls on three

subjects, and our method made reasonable calls on all three. We
are unclear whether the failure of ABSOLUTE to produce an
estimate for these subjects was due to a failure in SNP array
experiment or to the algorithm itself. Thus, it seems that
AbsCN—seq can work for certain samples where ABSOLUTE
cannot make a call. On the other hand, our method failed to
produce estimates in one case where ABSOLUTE could make an
estimate, thus providing complementary approaches. As has
been seen by ABSOLUTE, the best fitting solution is not
always the correct solution. The validation studies here show
that the top two solutions of our method usually cover the cor—
rect answer, but exceptions do exist. We recommend the user to
manually inspect each solution whenever possible. Although our
method does not yet incorporate subclonal tumor heterogeneity,
it has been shown to be robust to a considerable amount of such
heterogeneity, as well as to segmentation errors, in the estimates
of purity and ploidy.

Our method is ﬂexible in the sense that it can also be applied
to shallow whole—genome sequencing data (Li et al., 2011), an
emerging NGS application to identification of copy number vari—
ants genome—wide. However, presence of somatic mutations
cannot be reliably called in these type of data, let alone the cor—
responding variant allele frequency. For these type of data, we
can set the algorithm to only use copy number information, by
setting A = 1. The reduced objective function (ﬁrst term of
Equation 5) in step 2 now has a closed form solution. Deﬁne a
new parameter

y = ot/(oi‘t' + 2(1— (1)).

It is easy to see that when qi’s are given, Equation (3) reduces
to a simple linear regression on qi’s. Then at can be obtained from
the y estimate. A caveat arises when we apply this form of
AbsCN—seq to the WES data as seen in Figure 3a. We observed
a systematic upward bias in the purity estimates as compared
with the SNP—based ABSOLUTE estimates. However, by incor—
porating the SNV information, such bias was greatly diminished,
and this did not appear to affect the ploidy estimates. This might
not be a concern in practice, as for WES data, we will always use
the default form with SNV information. At this moment, it is not
clear to us what is the major cause for the small remaining
observed bias. Platform—specific biases in the raw copy ratio
data could be one possible reason. For instance, as shown by
Carter et al. (2012), the algorithm relying on the Illumina SNP
array data (Van Loo et al., 2010) systematically underestimate
tumor purity, as compared with the ABSOLUTE method relying
on the Affymetrix SNP array data. Likewise, the apparent small
overestimation of purity by our method as compared with
ABSOLUTE might also be attributed to the characteristics of
WES data compared with SNP array data. A supporting evi—
dence is that we did not observe such minor biases when the
platform is fixed. We have not tested our method on shallow
WGS data with reference to purity estimates and we do not
know yet if such overestimation also exists in the WGS data.
Future work will examine the performance of the method on
shallow WGS data, when a benchmark dataset becomes
available.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) has opened up previ-
ously unheard of possibilities for identifying novel disease genes in
Mendelian disorders, only about half of which have been elucidated
to date. However, interpretation of WES data remains challenging.
Results: Here, we analyze protein—protein association (PPA) networks
to identify candidate genes in the vicinity of genes previously implicated
in a disease. The analysis, using a random-walk with restart (RWR)
method, is adapted to the setting of WES by developing a composite
variant-gene relevance score based on the rarity, location and pre-
dicted pathogenicity of variants and the RWR evaluation of genes har-
boring the variants. Benchmarking using known disease variants from
88 disease-gene families reveals that the correct gene is ranked among
the top 10 candidates in 350% of cases, a figure which we confirmed
using a prospective study of disease genes identified in 2012 and PPA
data produced before that date. We implement our method in a freely
available Web server, ExomeWalker, that displays a ranked list of can-
didates together with information on PPAs, frequency and predicted
pathogenicity of the variants to allow quick and effective searches for
candidates that are likely to reward closer investigation.

1 INTRODUCTION

The identiﬁcation of causative disease genes in Mendelian dis-
orders has contributed greatly to our understanding of gene
functions and biological pathways in rare and common disease

(Antonarakis and Beckmann, 2006). With the development of
whole-exome sequencing (WES), the pace of identification of
novel disease genes has accelerated (Gilissen et al., 2011) to the
extent that groups such as the International Rare Disease
Research Consortium has set out the goal of comprehensive dis-
covery of the molecular etiologies of all rare diseases to enable
molecular diagnosis for all affected individuals by the year 2020
(Baxter and Terry, 2011).

Before WES, most gene discovery projects made use of linkage
analysis or association studies, which typically identiﬁed genomic
intervals of 0.}10 cm containing up to 300 genes (Botstein and
Risch, 2003; Glazier et al., 2002). Numerous computational pro-
cedures have been developed to prioritize candidate genes in the
intervals and guide DNA sequencing efforts (reviewed in Moreau
and Tranchevent, 2012). Although WES provides sequence in-
formation for the great majority of targeted exon sequences, the
need for prioritization remains. An individual exome typically
contains >30 000 variants as compared with the genomic refer-
ence sequence, thousands of which are predicted to lead to non-
synonymous amino acid substitutions, alterations of conserved
splice site residues or small insertions or deletions. Typical ana-
lysis strategies have relied on the characteristics of the variants,
focusing on rare variants that are predicted to be pathogenic
(Robinson et al., 2011), but even after such ﬁltering, around
~10(%1000 candidate disease-causing variants are found in a
single WES dataset, and additional methods are needed to pre-
dict which of them may have serious functional consequences
and prioritize them for validation (Li et al., 2013; Pelak et al.,
2010). Because each genome harbors ~100 genuine loss-of-func-
tion (LOF) variants with ~20 genes completely inactivated
(MacArthur et al., 2012), a purely variant-based prioritization
of candidate genes in WES studies will be limited in its ability to
correctly identify the true disease gene.

Previous gene prioritization strategies for prioritizing genes in
linkage studies evaluated one or more characteristics of the

genes, including functional annotation, gene-expression data or
sequence-based features (Tranchevent et al., 2011). Strategies to
prioritize candidate genes in exome sequencing studies can also
exploit the variant data itself in an attempt to improve priori-
tization of Mendelian disease genes, somatic mutations in cancer
and others. A number of tools and pipelines have been developed
that exploit sophisticated variant ﬁltering strategies. The tools
combine ﬁltering steps that exclude common variants and
retain only variants that are predicted likely pathogenic using
tools such as MutationTaster (Schwarz et al., 2010), and then
exploit sequences from multiple unrelated individuals with the
sought-after disease to search for genes mutated in most or all of
the individuals, as well as linkage or pedigree analysis (Coutant
et al., 2012; Li et al., 2012; Santoni et al., 2014; Sifrim et al., 2012;
Yandell et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2013). Recently, approaches
have been introduced that combine variant impact prediction
with gene prioritization. The eXtasy algorithm uses genomic
data fusion to integrate variant impact prediction, haploinsufﬁ-
ciency prediction and phenotype-speciﬁc gene prioritization
(Sifrim et al., 2013). The Exomiser implements PHIVE,
PHenotypic Interpretation of Variants in Exomes, an algorithm
that integrates the calculation of phenotype similarity between
human diseases and genetically modiﬁed mouse models, with
evaluation of the variants according to allele frequency, patho-
genicity and mode of inheritance (Robinson et al., 2014). FunSeq
intersects regions of the genome that are likely to be sensitive to
mutations with an analysis for variants that disrupt transcrip-
tion-factor binding sites (Khurana et al., 2013). Each of these
algorithms essentially seeks genes or genomic regions that are
both relevant to the disease under investigation and also
harbor variants likely to be pathogenic. We therefore reasoned
that a key factor in exome prioritization algorithms is to intersect
the results of variant analysis with a method that can prioritize
genes according to their potential relevance.

The analysis of protein interaction networks has been widely
used for computational analysis of human disease (Barabasi,
2007; Gonzalez and Kann, 2012). Typically, proteins do not
act in isolation, but rather perform their functions cooperatively
within a network of functionally related proteins. That is, groups
of functionally related proteins may physically interact with one
another and thereby form a ‘molecular nanomachine’ that me-
diates a particular biological function at cellular or systems level.
A proteiniprotein interaction (PPI) may be deﬁned as a speciﬁc
physical contact with molecular docking between proteins that
occurs in cells or in a living organism in vivo (De Las Rivas and
Fontanillo, 2010). Currently, data on >100 000 PPIs in humans
are available (Schaefer et al., 2013), derived from experimental
methods including the yeast two-hybrid system and tandem af-
ﬁnity purification. In this work, we make use of data from the
search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes/proteins
(STRING) (Franceschini et al., 2013), which contains not only
PPIs but also indirect (functional) associations derived from gen-
omic context, high-throughput experiments, conserved coex-
pression and text-mining. We will refer to this network as the
proteiniprotein association (PPA) network. The complete set of
all such interactions and associations has been referred to as the
interactome, and with the increased quantity and quality of such
data, analysis of the protein interactome offers an important
resource for systems-level understanding of cellular processes.

The interactome has also become an important resource for
the computational prioritization of disease genes (Moreau and
Tranchevent, 2012). The main assumption of these methods is
that genes linked to diseases with similar or even identical pheno-
typic manifestations will in many cases code for genes that inter-
act in speciﬁc subnetworks within the larger interactome.
Therefore, lists of candidate genes can be prioritized according
to the Vicinity of the candidates genes within the interactome to
other known members of a given disease-gene family. Initial
efforts to rank disease genes exploited the presence of direct
interactions (Oti et al., 2006) or the length of the shortest path
of interactions leading from a candidate gene to a known disease
gene (George et al., 2006). We have shown that a global network
measure of distance in the proteiniprotein interaction network
obtained by random walk analysis, substantially improves can-
didateigene prioritization, including the search for direct neigh-
bors of other disease genes (Kohler et al., 2008). In fact, it was
shown that random-walk approaches outperform other gene-
prioritization methods (Navlakha and Kingsford, 2010). In this
work, we test the hypothesis that random-walk analysis of the
protein interactome can improve prioritization of candidate
disease genes in exome sequencing studies.

2 METHODS

2.1 Protein—protein and functional interaction data

The PPA network is represented by an undirected graph with nodes
representing the genes and edges representing the mapped interactions
of the proteins encoded by the genes. Data were taken from STRING
(Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins) version
9.05, which contains experimental, predicted and transferred proteini
protein interactions, together with interactions obtained through text
mining (Franceschini et al., 2013). Only high-conﬁdence interactions
(score at least 0.7) were used.

2.2 Disease-gene families

A disease-gene family is deﬁned here as a group of genes in which a
mutation in any one of the genes leads to a clinically similar disorder.
Thus, a disease-gene family comprises the genes associated with some
genetically heterogeneous disease. In this work, we have used data on
the phenotypic series from Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man
(OMIM) (Amberger et al., 2011) of March 2013. Each phenotypic
series provides a View of genetic heterogeneity of similar phenotypes
across the genome.

2.3 Simulation of whole-exome and disease data

To validate our methodology, we developed a simulation strategy based
on adding known disease-causing mutations from the Human Gene
Mutation Database (HGMD) into either one of 1092 unaffected whole-
exome ﬁles in variant call format (VCF) from the 1000 Genomes Project
(1000 Genomes Project Consortium et al., 2012) or 144 in-house exomes.
The 1000 Genomes Project individual whole-exome ﬁles were extracted
from the integrated call sets (October 12, 2012 release) using tabix (Li,
2011) version 0.2.6 and vcftools (Danecek et al., 2011) version 0.1.9.
From the initial 233 phenotypic series involving 1356 genes, we eventually
tested 88 series that contained at least four genes and with known
HGMD mutation(s) for the disease described in the phenotypic series,
corresponding to 285 genes. For autosomal dominant (AD) diseases, one
heterozygous mutation was added, and for autosomal recessive (AR)
diseases, one homozygous mutation was added to the whole-exome ﬁles.

2.4 Whole-exome analysis and ﬁltering

For each of the simulated exomes, we used an exome analysis pipeline to
ﬁlter variants according to rarity, predicted pathogenicity and conform-
ance with the expected mode of inheritance. To ﬁlter variants according
to rarity, information concerning population minor allele frequency
(MAF) of variants was derived from the database of single nucleotide
polymorphisms (dbSNP) (NCBI Resource Coordinators, 2013) and from
the Exome Variant Server (2013). For this work, the maximum popula-
tion frequency of a variant was taken to be its maximal reported fre-
quency in any data source. For the dbSNP data, only the reported
frequencies from Phase I 1000 Genome Project variants were included.
In addition, ExomeWalker scores variants according to the MAF as pre-
viously described (Robinson et al., 2014) to give a frequency score be-
tween 1 and 0 for variants with a MAF between 0 and 2%, with more
common variants receiving a score of 0. In all simulations reported in this
work, variants with a MAF >1% were excluded.

In a typical whole-exome analysis, many of the variants have no avail-
able frequency data in public databases for assessment. Hence, for the
simulations involving 1000 Genomes Project-based exomes, we did not
make use of the 1000 Genomes Project frequency data, as this would lead
to an unfair advantage because each of the nondisease-associated vari-
ants would have frequency data available for ﬁltering and prioritization.

Variants in the VCF ﬁles (which are deﬁned using chromosomal
coordinates) were then annotated at transcript level using J annovar
(lager et al., 2014). To ﬁlter variants according to predicted pathogen-
icity, a variant score was calculated for each variant. First of all, off-
target variants (those not located in protein coding sequences or in splice
sites) were given a score of zero and removed. Secondly, non-synonymous
variants leading to the substitution of an amino acid residue were scored
according to the most deleterious prediction of SIFT (Ng and Henikoff,
2002), Polyphen2 (Adzhubei et al., 2010) or MutationTaster (Schwarz
et al., 2010). These predictions were extracted from deSFP (Liu
et al., 2011). Links between genes and Mendelian diseases were extracted
from data of the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man resource
(Amberger et al., 2011). In some cases, no predictions were available
from any of these three sources, and a pathogenicity prediction of 0.6
was assigned. This value was arrived at during optimization for another
exome prioritization tool (Robinson et al., 2014) and represents a com-
promise between assuming novel variants are non-pathogenic or fully
pathogenic. For other classes of variants, pathogenicity scores were as-
signed as previously described (Robinson et al., 2014). Future versions of
ExomeWalker will look to incorporate a single measure of pathogenicity
for all types of variants such as CADD scores (Kircher et al., 2014).

For variants that pass the ﬁltering steps, a variant score is assigned for
prioritization, which is simply the product of this pathogenicity score and
the frequency score described above.

2.5 Random walk analysis

The random walk on graphs (Can et al., 2005) is deﬁned as an iterative
walker’s transition from its current node to a randomly selected neighbor
starting at a given source node, s. Here, we used a variant of the random
walk in which we additionally allow the restart of the walk in every time
step at node 5 with probability r. Formally, the random walk with restart
(RWR) is deﬁned as

p.+1=(1— r)Wp, +rpo (1)

The transition matrix W is the column-normalized adjacency matrix of
the graph, and p, is a vector in which the iLh element holds the probability
of being at node i at time step t.

In our application, the initial probability vector p0 was constructed
such that equal probabilities were assigned to the nodes representing
members of the disease, with the sum of the probabilities equal to 1.
This is equivalent to letting the random walker begin from each of the

known disease genes with equal probability. Candidate genes were ranked
according to the values in the steady-state probability vector poo. While it
is possible to obtain pco by explicitly calculating Equation (1) until con-
vergence, we instead solve the equation pco = (1 — 0me -l- rp0 to obtain

P00 = r(1 - (1 - r)W)’1Po (2)

By precalculating the matrix r(I — (1 — r)W)T1, we can perform
random walk analysis as a simple matrix multiplication of the vector p0
in 0(n2) time, where n is the number of genes in the network. Therefore,
denoting r(I — (1 — r)W)T1 by R, we can calculate the result of the
random walk analysis by a simple matrix multiplication pco =Rp0. We
can further simplify the calculations by noting that most of the elements
of the vector p0 are zero, with only the elements representing the m seed
genes having the non-zero value Denoting the set of the indices of these
elements as {1"}, then it is easy to see that only the corresponding col-
umns of R contribute to the ﬁnal values of poo, whose iLh element can be
given as

part] = i Z) Ru, :1 (3)
m
1'60}

That is, to get element i in pm, we need only to take the sum of the
products of the non-zero elements of p0 with the corresponding elements
of column i of R. The computational complexity of the random walk
analysis in Equation (1) is dominated by the matrix-vector multiplications
in each step, which is 0(n2) for an n x n matrix. In contrast, our method
requires precomputation of one matrix inversion, but the actual calcula-
tion of p00 is 0(mn) with m << n, as there are 0(m) operations to calculate
Equation (3), which has to be done for each of the n elements of poo.

p00 is a probability vector, and all its entries sum to unity. For the
purposes of exome analysis, only those genes that have rare predicted
pathogenic variants are considered. For the analysis described in this
article, we chose a value of 0.7 for the restart probability r.

2.6 ExomeWalker score

Finally, a gene is assigned a combined ExomeWalker score, which is a
combination of the random walk score and the best scoring variant in
that gene. In the case of AR inheritance under a compound heterozygous
model, the variant score is taken to be the average of the two highest
scoring variants. Logistic regression on a training set of 20 000 disease
variants and 20 000 benign variants was run through the Waikato
Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) (Hall et al., 2009) data-
mining package to generate the optimal way of combining the variant and
random walker scores into a ﬁnal ExomeWalker score. A 10-fold cross
validation was used to train and test the model, and the average of the 10
models was used for the ﬁnal algorithm. Receiver operating characteristic
analysis on the test datasets gave an average area under the curve of 0.96
for the ExomeWalker score compared with 0.78 for the variant score and
0.9 for the random walk score. This ﬁnal ExomeWalker score gives a
measure from 0 to 1 of how close the gene is to known disease-associated
genes in the interactome and how rare and pathogenic are the variants in
the gene.

2.7 Benchmarking of ExomeWalker

For the simulated exomes involving known disease variants in 285 genes
from 88 phenotypic series, we performed 5000 analyses per experiment.
ExomeWalker was run using the other genes in the phenotypic series as
seed genes for the random walk. Genes were ranked by either the variant
score or the ExomeWalker score. We then compared performance by
assessing how often the known disease gene was recovered as the top
hit or in the top 10 or 50 candidates. An ordinal ranking method
was used where equal scoring genes are resolved arbitrarily but consist-
ently by assigning a unique rank to each of the ties. In our case, we simply

sort the equally scored genes alphabetically and assign the ranks.
This corresponds to the real life use case where a researcher would
have to take each of the equally scored top candidates and investigate
each one by one for causality by further experimentation or for further
candidacy by reviewing the literature/databases using their expert
knowledge.

3 RESULTS

In this work, we have implemented an algorithm for prioritizing
candidate genes in WES studies by searching for rare variants
with predicted pathogenicity in genes located in the Vicinity of
phenotypically related genes in a functional interaction network.
We constructed a PPA network based on 210945 associations
among 12 511 human genes using high-conﬁdence interactions in
the STRING database (Franceschini et al., 2013). We imple-
mented a global distance measure based on RWR to deﬁne
similarity between genes within this interaction network
(Kohler et al., 2008). The RWR algorithm ranks genes on the
basis of their similarity to known or suspected disease genes.
In our benchmarking, we use phenotypic series from the
OMIM resource (Amberger et al., 2011) to define disease-gene
families. Users of ExomeWalker can either use these same dis-
ease-gene families or enter their own list of genes that are known
or suspected to be associated with the disease being studied.

In parallel, variants from an exome are annotated and the fre-
quency and predicted pathogenicity are evaluated. Candidate
genes with rare, potentially pathogenic variants are then prior-
itized using both the results of variant evaluation and the Vicinity
in the PPA network of the genes harboring the variants to the
seed genes (see Section 2 for details).

Figure 1 shows the results of our analysis using STRING
V9.05 as the source of interactome data. Analysis was performed
by adding known disease variants to either in-house exomes
or 1000 Genome Project exomes and with and without the
appropriate inheritance model for the disease being tested.

The results show a substantial performance increase when
including the random walk measure of proteiniprotein inter-
actions with other genes associated with the disease as compared
with either the variant score or the RWR score alone. For
example, 39.4% of the tested exomes contained the known dis-
ease gene as the top hit for the 1000 Genomes Projectibased
simulations compared with 1.4% when just using variant patho-
genicity and frequency to assess candidacy. This is out of an
average of 907 postﬁltered genes and 97.1% of the disease
genes are kept during this ﬁltering step. This increases to 43.5
and 67.3% for the AD and recessive models out of an average of
632 and 374 postfiltered genes, respectively. Similar performance
and gains are seen when adding the disease variants to our in-
house exomes that contain many more postfiltered genes (1141
on average for no inheritance model). The correct gene was pre-
sent within the top 10 ranked candidates in nearly 75% of the
simulations using in-house exomes. As shown in Figures 1 and 2,
a large proportion of the performance comes from the random
walk prioritization of the filtered exome candidates with the add-
ition of variant pathogenicity and frequency data adding a fur-
ther 540% increase.

STRING includes text-mined associations between genes and
it is possible some of these associations may come from

including the text-mined association but ExomeWalker still

Walking the interactome

 

Project exomes with no inheritance model, the ExomeWalker
performance drops from 39.4 to 26.1%, having the correct
gene as the top hit but this is still 24.7% higher than with the
variant-based scoring alone.

This strategy of removing all text-mined associations will have
removed many genuine interactions that would be useful for
prioritization of a novel diseaseigene association. We expect
the real performance of ExomeWalker in such cases to lie some-
where in-between that seen in Figures 1 and 2. To gain a realistic
estimate of the performance of our method on new data, we
identified 19 diseaseigene associations that had been identiﬁed
in 2012 that belong to one of the phenotypic series and had a
known variant in HGMD. We tested the performance of our
method using a PPA dataset with data before the discovery of
any of these genes (STRING V9.0). The results are summarized
in Table 1. The true disease-causing gene was present within the
top 10 prioritized genes in 10 of 19 cases (~53%), similar to our
results using large-scale simulations.

4 DISCUSSION

Computational candidate gene prioritization has matured into a
ﬁeld that has developed and benchmarked scores of algorithms
that exploit and integrate complex and heterogeneous datasets
including gene expression, sequence annotations, data mining,
genetic sequences, functional annotations and proteiniprotein
interaction networks (Aerts et al., 2006; Lage et al., 2007;
Perez-Iratxeta et al., 2002; Tranchevent et al., 2011; Turner
et al., 2003). The fundamental algorithms have been improved
and extended in many ways, such as including tissue-speciﬁcity in
the analysis of the protein interactome (Magger et al., 2012).
Initial computational analysis of exome sequence data concen-
trated on filtering variants according to their population fre-
quency, predicted pathogenicity and the presence of rare
predicted-pathogenic mutations in multiple unrelated individuals
with a certain rare disease (‘intersection’ strategy; Boycott et al.,
2013; Robinson et al., 2011). However, it has become apparent
that it remains difﬁcult to identify novel disease genes or even
known disease genes with WES because of the sheer number of
candidate mutations; each genome is thought to harbor ~100
genuine LOF variants with ~20 genes completely inactivated
(MacArthur et al., 2012). Therefore, filtering on variant charac-
teristics alone is not effective in situations where a single affected
individual or only a small number of individuals are being inves-
tigated. Therefore, just as positional cloning approaches were
limited by the availability of large well-characterized families,
disease-identification studies by WES are often limited by the
number of individual exome sequences available for variant
intersection. For this reason, candidate gene prioritization meth-
ods have recently begun to be applied to exome analysis. With
positional cloning, prioritization would be applied to all genes
located within the linkage interval; with exome studies, priori-
tization is applied to all genes that harbor rare, potentially patho-
genic mutations. In both settings, the number of genes may be in
the hundreds. Recently, exome prioritization methods have been
introduced that exploit data fusion, phenotypic data and model
organism phenotype data (Robinson et al., 2014; Sifrim et al.,
2013). Random-walk analysis of proteiniprotein interaction data
has been shown to be a powerful approach to gene prioritization

in the setting of positional cloning projects (Kohler et al., 2008;
Navlakha and Kingsford, 2010). In this work, therefore, we have
adapted our previous approach and tested its utility for exome
analysis.

Figure 3 illustrates the gene prioritization procedure in the
case of DDOST and DPM2, components of the oligosaccharyl-
transferase complex that transfers a glycan chain to nascent pro-
teins. Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are inherited
AR diseases that impair N—glycosylation, and previously identi-
ﬁed CDG disease genes were used to prioritize candidate genes
including DDOST and DPM2 in the simulations summarized in
Table 1. It can be seen that DDOST has only two direct inter-
actions with CDG seed genes and is at some distance from the
others, leading to it only being ranked 23rd. However, DPM2
has multiple direct and second-degree interactions with CDG
genes leading to it being ranked as the top-ranked candidate in
simulations.

In contrast, other genes did not achieve a high rank. For in-
stance, TMEM5, mutations which were shown to be a cause of
type A muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy (V uillaumier-
Barrot et al., 2012), was placed at rank 19 by our method.
This gene has only one high-conﬁdence association in the
STRING database, with PLAU (plasminogen activator, urokin-
ase), which itself has 10 high-confidence associations to other
genes, none of which is related to type A muscular dystrophy-
dystroglycanopathy. Therefore, although mutations in TMEM5
cause the same disease as mutations in the other genes of this
family (POMGNTI, POMGN T2, ISPD, FKTN, POM TI ,
POM T2, FKRP, LARGE), there is little functional similarity re-
ﬂecting this in STRING. Thus, although PPA analysis offers an
effective way of prioritizing disease genes in many cases, there are
disease genes that do not show a high random walk score.

In cases where the causative gene does not interact with pre-
vious members of the disease-gene family, or for diseases where
there are no previously known genes, other approaches will have
to be considered. We recently described an approach, Exomiser,
that uses phenotype comparisons with model organism data to
inform on candidacy (Robinson et al., 2014). eXtasy is another
recently published solution that uses phenotype comparisons
along with consideration of many other data types (Sifrim
et al., 2013). To contrast and compare these different approaches
we applied them to the same set of recently solved cases and
report the performance in Table 1. Note that eXtasy does not
perform any variant filtering, and so, to allow a fair comparison
we used VCF ﬁles that had already been filtered in the same way
as for the ExomeWalker benchmarking. Three of the diseases
currently have no phenotype annotations available and are there-
fore not runnable through eXtasy or particularly amenable to
Exomiser prioritization. eXtasy can only inform on non-syn-
onymous variants and four of the cases involve a small deletion,
which again was not assessable. Finally, for two of the cases,
eXtasy removed the causative variant during analysis, so no
ﬁnal ranking was possible. For 2 of the 10 remaining cases,
Exomiser and eXtasy performed better than ExomeWalker,
with ExomeWalker outperforming them in the other cases.
KLHL3 is a good example where there is minimal evidence for
interactions with previously implicated genes but where use of
phenotype data allowed identiﬁcation of the causative variant as
the top or second best hit using eXtasy or Exomiser, respectively.

Fig. 3. PPA network derived from congenital disorders of glycosylation,
type I (CDG-I) seed genes. The candidate genes DDOST and DMPZ
(shown in blue) interact with multiple other CDG-I genes (shown as
red nodes in the network) via paths of length one and two. The
random walk methodology essentially integrates over all interaction
paths between seed genes and a candidate gene to generate a similarity
score. Although short paths such as those shown in the ﬁgure have the
most inﬂuence on the score, other aspects of the global network structure
are also taken into account (Kohler et al., 2008)

In contrast for the three cases where ExomeWalker identiﬁed the
causative gene as the top hit, both eXtasy and Exomiser were
unable to achieve this efﬁcient prioritization.

5 CONCLUSON

We have implemented our method in a freely available Web
server called ExomeWalker. Users can upload a VCF ﬁle and
choose one of 243 phenotypic series or enter their own disease-
gene family in the form of a list of Entrez Gene identiﬁers. These
genes may already be known to be associated with the disease or
be members of a pathway suspected of being disrupted in the
disease or just candidates from in—house knowledge. If the VCF
ﬁle contains multiple samples, ExomeWalker will assume that all
samples are from the same family and will ask the user to upload
a pedigree (PED) ﬁle. It will then perform pedigree filtering on
the genes and variants represented in the VCF ﬁle using the
Jannovar library (Jager et al., 2014). It will subsequently rank
the candidate genes and return a list of candidates together with
information about the genes. Importantly, it will show all ﬁrst-
and second-degree interactions with the seed genes, allowing

users to quickly eyeball candidate lists to determine if there are
genes with multiple functional associations with the seed genes
that would reward closer inspection. Exome sequencing remains
a difﬁcult endeavor, and large-scale exome-sequencing studies
for the identiﬁcation of Mendelian disease causing genes have
reported success rates around 2(P35% (de Ligt et al., 2012; Yang
et al., 2013). Therefore, it is not realistically to be expected that a
prioritization method will place the correct gene in the first place,
or first few places, in all cases. An advantage of the methodology
presented here is that ExomeWalker quickly shows whether there
are candidate genes with both predicted pathogenic variants
and multiple functional associations with other genes in the
same disease-gene family. If this is not the case, users may
wish to explore phenotype-based (Robinson et al., 2014) or gen-
omic data fusion (Sifrim et al., 2013) prioritization of exome
data, or if possible sequence additional family samples to
enable linkage ﬁltering (Rodelsperger et al., 2011; Smith et al.,
2011), or sequence additional unrelated individuals for intersec-
tion-based (Robinson et al., 2011) approaches.

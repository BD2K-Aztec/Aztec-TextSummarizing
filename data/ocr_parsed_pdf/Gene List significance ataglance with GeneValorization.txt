ABSTRACT

Motivation: High-throughput technologies provide fundamental
informations concerning thousands of genes. Many of the current
research laboratories daily use one or more of these technologies
and end-up with lists of genes. Assessing the originality of the
results obtained includes being aware of the number of publications
available concerning individual or multiple genes and accessing
information about these publications. Faced with the exponential
growth of publications avaliable and number of genes involved in
a study, this task is becoming particularly difficult to achieve.
Results: We introduce GeneValorization, a web-based tool that
gives a clear and handful overview of the bibliography available
corresponding to the user input formed by (i) a gene list (expressed
by gene names or ids from EntrezGene) and (ii) a context of study
(expressed by keywords). From this input, GeneValorization provides
a matrix containing the number of publications with co-occurrences
of gene names and keywords. Graphics are automatically generated
to assess the relative importance of genes within various contexts.
Links to publications and other databases offering information on
genes and keywords are also available. To illustrate how helpful
GeneValorization is, we will consider the gene list of the OncotypeDX
prognostic marker test.

1 INTRODUCTION

High throughput technologies (e.g. comparative pan-genomic
hybridization, gene expression, protein and methylation arrays,
high-throughput DNA sequencing) are major, promising and very
exciting tools to study biology. Each of them provide fundamental
informations concerning thousands of genes such as their normal
functions or speciﬁc alterations (e.g. DNA copy number alteration,
loss of heterozygosity, change in expression, promoter methylation,
mutation or post-translational modiﬁcation).

Many of the current biological research laboratories daily use
one or more of these technologies. Selecting genes of interest to
design ﬁirther experiments is of paramount importance. In this

process, scientists need to access the latest publications concerning
individual or multiple genes. Among the genes they may consider,
researchers need to distinguish three categories of genes: (i) genes
already clearly shown to be associated with the process they are
studying; (ii) new and promising genes for a particular research ﬁeld
whose interest is well known in other research ﬁelds; (iii) genes that
have not been studied. This task is becoming particularly difﬁcult to
achieve faced with the many gene lists which are retrieved and the
exponential growth of publications available.

In this article, we introduce a web-based tool named
GeneValorization. Given a list of gene names and a set of keywords
describing the context of the study, GeneValorization provides a
matrix with the number of publications cociting each gene name
and keyword. GeneValorization thus gives very quickly a clear
and handful overview of the bibliography corresponding to a gene
list of interest within a given context of study. To illustrate how
helpful GeneValorization is, we consider here the gene list of the
OncotypeDX prognostic marker test (Paik et al., 2004), which is
composed of 16 genes and used to determine the individual relapse
risk of a breast cancer patient.

2 MAIN FUNCTIONALITIES

The main interface of GeneValorization is provided on Figure 1.
Basic queries: GeneValorization takes as input from the user a list
of gene names and a list of keywords that we call ﬁlters. Filters
are used to describe the context of the study: while the main ﬁlter
represents the main context (e.g. Breast cancer), secondary ﬁlters
are alternative ways of reﬁning this context (e.g. Proliferation,
Migration). Secondary ﬁlters can be as numerous as necessary.
Given this input, GeneValorization provides a matrix of data where
each line is dedicated to a gene and each column is dedicated to a
ﬁlter. The ﬁrst column considers the main ﬁlter only while the next
columns consider both the main ﬁlter and secondary ﬁlters. More
precisely, cells (x,y) of the ﬁrst column of the matrix contain the
numbers of publications cociting the main ﬁlter (on column y) and
the gene name (on line x). Cells from the second column and the
next ones contain the number of publications cociting the main ﬁlter
and the secondary ﬁlter (on column y) and the gene name (on line x).
Columns where a secondary ﬁlter is provided thus allow to subdivide
the set of papers considered. In Figure l, GeneValorization reported
5138 papers involving PGR in Breast Cancer (main ﬁlter). Among
them, 658 papers are also related to Proliferation while 234 mention
Apoptosis.

Specifying species and using aliases: GeneValorization is able to
perform its search not only using the gene name g provided by
the user but also using all aliases of g within a given species, by
exploiting information from EntrezGene. The default species used
is Human, which can be changed by the user. It is also possible not
to consider aliases. All the menus available to make such choices
are described in the manual.

Gene name disambiguation: GeneValorization provides assistance
in the process of gene name disambiguation. Ids from EntrezGene
can be directly entered (preﬁxed by #) instead of gene names. When
users provide a gene name g, GeneValorization uses EntrezGene to
check which of the three following cases occur: (i) g is an ofﬁcial
gene name; (ii) g is not an ofﬁcial gene name but appears in the list
of synonyms of one or several ofﬁcial gene names (within the same
species); and (iii) none of the above. In case (i), GeneValorization
runs normally, the gene name is green to indicate that it is ofﬁcial. In
case (ii), the gene name appears in orange and by right clicking on
the name, the user can access the list of ofﬁcial gene names having
g in their aliases. Users are provided with links to EntrezGene web
pages describing each alternative so that they can then choose one
of them to remove any ambiguity (the orange gene name can thus
be renamed using one of the alternative ofﬁcial names). In case (iii),
the gene name appears in red to indicate that it is not an existing
gene name.

By default, GeneValorization will still perform all searches
using the value entered by the user. In case (ii), and if the user
allows synonyms to be considered, GeneValorization will choose to
consider the ﬁrst ofﬁcial gene name provided by EntrezGene.
Visualizing results: clicking on a cell of the main grid allows users
to measure the relative importance of genes and keywords. As an
example, clicking on the cell corresponding to PGR and Proliferation
generates the graph of Figure l (right-hand side) and states that
PGR is the third most important gene (according to the number of
publications) for the Breast Cancer and Proliferation topics, out of

the 16 genes considered here. All the papers associated with the
keywords are provided and can be accessed. Interestingly, it is also
possible to compare the role of several secondary ﬁlters (several
graphs can be displayed at the same time).

Accessing information from other sources: links to several databases
are also provided. As for genes, information from PubMed,
EntrezGene, GeneCards and DrugBank can be obtained (e.g. Fig. 1
shows the DrugBank web page for PGR). GeneValorization also
makes calls to the NLM MeSH browser (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/
mesh/meshhome.html) to match the keywords provided by the user
with MeSH terms and places them within the MeSH ontology.
Data import/export: GeneValorization allows users to load and save
gene lists and ﬁlters using various formats (e.g. text ﬁles, csv, xml).
During the export, EntrezGene ids used to search for the aliases are
added to the saved matrix.

Advanced queries: Users can express advanced queries involving
wilcards ‘*’ and ‘AND’ in gene names or ﬁlters. Considering gene
names with or without aliases (from EntrezGene) is possible. Users
may also indicate which part of the PubMed ﬁle should be queried
(e.g. abstract, title).

3 TECHNICAL INFORMATION

GeneValorization is a Java webstart application. It is thus
multiplatform and can be used without any speciﬁc installation.
GeneValorization follows an on-the-ﬂy querying process: queries
are directly sent to portals (Entrez or SRS), and no warehousing is
needed. Loading a cell information may take 1—4 seconds. It took
10 minutes (but each result is displayed as soon as it is available) to
load the entire information associated to the gene list, considering all
the aliases available in EntrezGene, of the OncotypeDX prognostic
marker test, with the 19 secondary ﬁlters. To deal with long list of
genes or ﬁlters, a caching system has been implemented to optimize
the response time. It makes it possible to save previous loaded data

which can be updated on demand later on. Last, GeneValorization
is currently able to run on the Entrez NCBI portal (http://www.ncbi
.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/) or the EBI SRS server (http://srs.ebi.ac.uk/);
queries will be sent and interpreted by the respective portals. Among
the differences, MeSH terms are automatically considered during
this search when Entrez is used while it is a pure cooccurrence-based
search in SRS (more information is available in the Supplementary
Material).

4 PROOF OF CONCEPT

The OncotypeDX test quantiﬁes the probability of distant recurrence
in patients with node negative, estrogen receptor positive breast
carcinoma. It is composed of 16 cancer-related genes, selected after
a validation step on independent studies. This test has been included
in the guidelines of the American Society of Clinical Oncology and
the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.

We have used GeneValorization to analyze the literature
corresponding to these 16 genes. Two queries have been uploaded
with ‘Cancer’ and ‘Breast Cancer’ as main ﬁlter. The 19 secondary
ﬁlters have been considered corresponding to examples of the most
general items to depict the composition of a cancer gene list.

As a ﬁrst result, GeneValorization allowed us to know that each
of the genes has been refered in association with the term ‘Cancer’
and ‘Breast Cancer’ in 5 to 17517 and 3 to 10048 publications.

Second, GeneValorization made it possible to distinguish three
sets of genes in the OncotypeDX test. Five genes (ERBBZ, ESRI,
PGR, BCLZ, MKI67) were highly studied (>1000 publications
associated) while four genes (BAGI, CTSLZ, MYBLZ, SCUBEZ)
were not very actively studied (less than 50 publications) and the
seven remaining genes (GSTMI, AURKA, BIRC5, CCNBI, CD68,
MMPII , GRB7) had an intermediate level. All the genes of the list
are thus not equally known to be involved in breast cancer. Genes
associated to only a few or no publications are then of particular
interest since they have been selected to be in the signature while
not being studied extensively. Our study suggests to conduct new
experiments on some of these genes to better demonstrate how
connected to breast cancer they may be.

Third, GeneValorization underlined that the secondary ﬁlters
‘Proliferation’, ‘Apoptosis’, ‘Invasion’, and ‘Angiogenesis’ were
strongly associated with the gene list while ‘Immunity’, ‘Cell-
cycle arrest’, ‘Epigenetic’ or ‘microRNA’ were much less often
associated. This underlines the fact that the OncotypeDX signature
is a publication-based molecular signature which contains genes
involved in processes commonly known to be linked to breast cancer
prognosis but does not contain genes known to be related to new
trails in breast cancer studies (as the role of immune response in
cancerogenesis).

5 DISCUSSION

Mining PubMed abstracts and ranking publications have been of
particular interest in the last years. Approaches are mostly based
on Text-Mining techniques [see for instance, Vellay et al. (2009) or
Krallinger et al. (2008) and the references therein]. When available,
softwares able to analyze genes such as PDQWizard (Grimes et al.,
2006), GoGene (Plake et al., 2009) and CoPubMapper (Alako
et al., 2005) differ from GeneValorization in several aspects. From
a technical perspective, (i) they make use of data warehouses to
store publications, which poses the major problem of updating the
local databases and makes it impossible to beneﬁt from all of
new publications daily available and (ii) they may not consider
simultaneaous requests which makes the response time too long.
From a functionality perspective, (i) they may not be ﬂexible, e.g.
providing only predeﬁned lists of keywords and (ii) they may not
consider gene aliases. From a user perspective, they may not provide
results in a concise and/or graphical manner and may not allow
users to easily store and load their results at any time. A more
complete related work (eight tools compared with GeneValorization)
is available in the Supplementary Material.

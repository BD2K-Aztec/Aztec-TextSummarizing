ABSTRACT

Motivation: Modeling and analysis of complex systems are important
aspects of understanding systemic behavior. In the lack of detailed
knowledge about a system, we often choose modeling equations out
of convenience and search the (high-dimensional) parameter space
randomly to learn about model properties. Qualitative modeling side-
steps the issue of choosing specific modeling equations and frees the
inference from specific properties of the equations. We consider
classes of ordinary differential equation (ODE) models arising from
interactions of species/entities, such as (bio)chemical reaction net-
works or ecosystems. A class is defined by imposing mild assump-
tions on the interaction rates. In this framework, we investigate
whether there can be multiple positive steady states in some ODE
models in a given class.

Results: We have developed and implemented a method to decide
whether any ODE model in a given class cannot have multiple steady
states. The method runs efficiently on models of moderate size. We
tested the method on a large set of models for gene silencing by sRNA
interference and on two publicly available databases of biological
models, KEGG and Biomodels. We recommend that this method is
used as (i) a pre-screening step for selecting an appropriate model and
(ii) for investigating the robustness of non-existence of multiple steady
state for a given ODE model with respect to variation in interaction
rates.

1 INTRODUCTION

Systems of interacting species are ubiquitous in many areas of
science, from biology and ecology to epidemiology and sociology
(Anderson and May, 1991; May, 1974; Murray, 2002). The dy-
namics of a system are typically speciﬁed by a system of ordinary
differential equations (ODEs), potentially depending on many
(unknown) parameters. The variables of the system are the con-
centrations (or abundances) of species, such as chemical or mo-
lecular species in systems biology, animal species in ecology or
infected and susceptible individuals in epidemiology.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Specifying the modeling equations is rarely trivial. For ex-
ample, in systems biology, the species concentrations change ac-
cording to the molecular reactions that take place, but the precise
reaction mechanisms and rates are typically unknown. For ex-
ample, choosing between mass-action, power-law or Hill-type
kinetics might be a matter of tradition or convenience rather
than biological knowledge. Mass-action kinetics has a simpler
functional form than the other two kinetics and only one par-
ameter. These, on the other hand, are more adaptable to systems
in biologically constrained environments, such as cellular sys-
tems. The choice of kinetics might thus affect the biological val-
idity of a conclusion derived from the ODEs. This remains true
even if we are comfortable with a particular system of ODEs: the
parameter space is generally high-dimensional and it is standard
to explore it numerically or by choosing parameters randomly.
However, this is difﬁcult to do efﬁciently when the number of
parameters is large. Consequently, we can only investigate a
small part of the parameter space.

These concerns have lead to an increased interest in qualitative
properties (Atay and J ost, 2011; Silk et al., 2011). In the context
of this article, qualitative properties refer to properties of dynam-
ical systems with a common underlying structure. We focus on a
particular qualitative property, namely the capacity for multiple
steady states, or multistationarity. The common structure is
deﬁned by an interaction network (defined in Section 2.1).
Multistationarity underlies the emergence of hysteresis and
switch-like behavior, that is, the transformation of a gradual
input into a steep change in the response. It plays an important
role in understanding systemic behavior (MarkeVich et al., 2004;
May, 1974; Murray, 2002).

We have developed and implemented a computationally
simple and efﬁcient criterion to determine if a class of dynamical
systems, compatible with the same underlying interaction net-
work, cannot have multiple steady states. The reaction (inter-
action) rates are constrained by how they vary with the species
concentrations. The criterion can be refined to preclude multi-
stationarity for particular classes of kinetics such as mass-action
kinetics and, more generally, power-law kinetics. Both of these are
used widely outside systems biology and biochemistry, but with-
out the biochemical labeling, e.g. Wiuf and Feliu (2013). The
method is well suited to screen large sets of networks for
the possible emergence of switch behavior. The applicability of
our approach is demonstrated by studying a series of
small motifs in gene silencing by RNA interference and by
analysis of 408 models from the KEGG (Kanehisa and Goto,
2000) and Biomodels databases (Li et al., 2010). In the

discussion we relate our method to other methods to preclude
multistationarity.

2 METHODS

2.1 Interaction networks

We deﬁne a qualitative model as an interaction network together with a
class of associated ODE systems. Interaction networks are qualitative
representations of how species interact and inﬂuence reaction rates. An
interaction network is a bipartite signed graph consisting of a set of
species nodes {S1, ...,Sn} and a set of reaction nodes {r1, ...,rm}.
Reactions are biochemical reactions between species nodes:

ru 3 £00,145} —> i/BLuSia (1)
i:l i:l

where at“, ,8“, are positive integers or zero. Edges are undirected and
between species and reactions. A positive (resp. negative) edge indicates
that the species has positive (resp. negative) inﬂuence on the rate of the
reaction, that is, the rate increases (resp. decreases) with the concentration
of the species. The absence of an edge implies that the reaction takes place
independently of the presence of the species.

As an example, consider the simple reversible MichaelisiMenten mech-
anism for activation of a substrate S:

S+E22X22S*+E. (2)

where E is an enzyme, 5* the activated substrate and X an intermediate
complex. In mass-action kinetics, the reactant species, and only those,
inﬂuence positively the rate of a reaction. With this assumption, the
interaction network corresponding to the MichaelisiMenten mechanism
is given in Figure 1.

2.2 Compatible dynamical systems

Let c,- be the concentration of species S,- and c 2 (c1, ...,c,,). To each
reaction r“, we associate a rate function Ku(c) deﬁned on a set S2,, that
includes [Rfr (all points with c,-> 0). A rate function K“ is compatible with
the inﬂuences if it fulﬁlls a monotonicity requirement:

0 K“ is increasing in c,- if there is a positive edge (S, r“).

a K“ is decreasing in c,- if there is a negative edge (S, r“).

a K“ is constant in c,- if there is no edge between S,- and r“.

If there is a positive edge between S,- and r“, we additionally require
that Ku(c) = 0 whenever c,- = 0, that is, the reaction only takes place in
the presence of the species with positive inﬂuence.

Let K“, u = 1, . . . , m, be rate functions compatible with the inﬂuences.
A dynamical system compatible with the interaction network is given by

m
cp- = Z (r... — caramel. ....cn). (3)
u:l
for i: 1, ...,n. The rate of change in c,- is a weighted sum of the rate

functions involving species S. The weight 151',“ — 05,3“, potentially zero, of
reaction r“ is the net production of S,- in that reaction.

For example, consider the MichalisiMenten mechanism in Figure 1
with the species ordered as S,.S‘*,E, X, and the reactions ordered as
S+E—> X, X—> S+E, X—> S*+E, S*+E—> X. The concentration
of a species Y is denoted by the same letter in lowercase, y. Then any
model, qualitatively identical to a mass-action model, has the form

i = K2(C) — [6(6), é = K2(C) + K3(C) — K1(C) — [9(6),

$9“ = K3(C) — [9(6), if = K1(C) + K4(C) — K2(C) — [9(6),

2.3 Conservation laws

Linear combinations of species concentrations may be preserved over
time. For example in (2), the sums EM 2 e + x and SM 2 s +s* + x
are constant. If these are determined by the reactions (1) alone, that is,
they are independent of the choice of inﬂuences and rate functions, then
they are said to be conservation laws.

For each reaction r“, consider the vector v“ in ER" with i-th component
ﬁr,“ — at“. Then the stoichiometric matrix, A, is the n x m matrix with
columns v“, u = 1, ...,m. The rank 1 of A is the dimension of the stoi-
chiometric space. Any vector w that lies in the left kernel of A, that is,
fulﬁlls WA :0 is a conservation law and w > (c1, ...,c,,) = ELI wici is
independent of time. Therefore, a set of linearly independent conservation
laws is obtained by choosing a basis {w1, . . . , w"} of the left kernel of A.
Because A has rank 1, there are d = n — l linearly independent conserva-
tion laws. Given total amounts Atlot, . . . , Afot in IR, the associated stoichio-
metric class is deﬁned by

{cER"|d»c=A{ot, forallj=1,...,d}. (4)

The dynamics takes place in a ﬁxed stoichiometric class determined by
the initial concentrations of the system.
In example (2), the stoichiometric matrix is

—1 1 0 0

0 0 1 —1

A_ —1 1 1 —1
1 —1 —1 1

A basis of the left kernel ofA is given by the vectors col = (1, 1, 0, 1) and
w2 = (0,0,1,1), which give the equations col c = s + s* + x and

w2»c=e+x.

2.4 Injectivity and multistationarity

An interaction network is said to have the capacity for multiple positive
steady states if there is a compatible dynamical system (3) that has more
than one positive steady state in some stoichiometric class. In other
words, it has the capacity for multiple positive steady states if there
exist rate functions KM, compatible with the inﬂuences, and total amounts

Atlot, . . . , Aﬂn, such that the system

has more than one positive solution (the choice of basis {601, . . . , cod} does
not affect the outcome). If the rank of A is maximal (d = 0), then there are
no conservation laws and (6) is disregarded. For i = 1, . . . ,n, let

gm. ....cn) = Zulu — caramel. ...,m. (7)
u:l

If the function g = (g1, ...,gn) is injective (one-to-one) over [R'J’r re-
stricted to a given stoichiometric class (4) then the system cannot have
multiple positive solutions within that class. An interaction network is
said to be injective if this is the case for all stoichiometric classes and all
rate functions compatible with the inﬂuences (that is, all compatible dy-
namical systems). In other words, an interaction network is injective if the
function deﬁned by the left-hand sides of (S) and (6) is injective for all
choices of compatible rate functions K“. The function maps c into WWI.

Clearly, an injective interaction network does not have the capacity for
multiple positive steady states in any stoichiometric class. We provide
here a simple characterization of injective interaction networks. Failure
of the criterion is thus a necessary condition for the existence of multiple
positive steady states in a dynamical system compatible with the given
interaction network (Wiuf and Feliu, 2013).

3 RESULTS

A matrix Y with symbolic entries y“ is called signinon-singular
if the determinant of Y is a non-zero homogeneous polynomial in
yM with all coefﬁcients being positive or all being negative. For
the matrices considered here, Y is signinon-singular if its deter-
minant has constant non-zero sign for positive values of y“.

3.1 Characterization of injective interaction networks

The inﬂuence matrix, Z, is an m x n symbolic matrix where the
non-zero entries are variables. The (u, i)-th entry is deﬁned as

o 2",,- if there is a positive edge (Shru).
o —zu,,- if there is a negative edge (Si, ru).

0 0 if there is no edge between S,- and ru.

Deﬁne the n x n matrix M as the product of A and Z,
M: AZ. Let {(01, ...,wd} be a basis of the left kernel of A
and let i1, ...,id be indices corresponding to d rows of A that
are linearly dependent of the remaining l rows (these will be
linearly independent). An easy way to determine the indices is
to compute a basis of the left kernel of A and perform Gaussian
elimination to obtain a new basis {(01, ...,wd}. Then i]- can be
taken to be the index of the first non-zero entry of a)i (Feliu and
Wiuf, 2012). We deﬁne a new n x n matrix, M*, by replacing the
ij-th row of M by mi.

The matrix M* has d rows with real entries and l rows whose
non-zero entries are linear polynomials in 2“. Hence, the deter-
minant of M* is either zero or a homogeneous polynomial in Z“
of degree l. Further, no variable has an exponent greater than 1.

THEOREM 1. (Wiuf and Feliu, 2013) An interaction network is
injective if and only if M * is signinon-singular.

The criterion is easy to check, e. g. the inﬂuence matrix of (2) is

21,1 0 23,1 0
0 0 0 Z4,2
0 0 0 Z4,3
0 22,4 23,4 0

Z:

The matrix M* is AZ with the ﬁrst row changed to (1, 1, 0, 1)
and the third row to (0,0, 1, 1) (according to the ﬁrst non-zero
entry):

1 l 0 l
_ 0 —Z2,4 —Z3,4 24,3
M* _ 0 0 1 1
21,1 22,4 Z3,1+Z3,4 —(Z4,2 +24,3)

The determinant of M* is
21,122,4 + 22,423,1+ 21,1214 + 22,424,2 + 21,1243,

which is a non-zero polynomial with all non-zero coefﬁcients
being positive. The interaction network is therefore injective
and there can at most be one positive steady state in any stoi-
chiometric class.

When the determinant of M* is identically zero, M* is not
signinon-singular and hence the network is not injective. In
this case, all steady states are degenerate, that is, the Jacobian
of the system is singular at the steady state (Feliu and Wiuf,
2012).

Existence of two terms of opposite signs in the determinant of
M* implies that there are two cycles of opposite signs in the so-
called speciesireaction graph (SR-graph) (Banaji and Craciun,
2009; Craciun and Feinberg, 2006; Wiuf and Feliu, 2013). These
correspond to two feedback loops, one negative and one positive,
in the SR-graph. Our method is thus a reﬁnement of Thomas’
rule (Kaufman et al., 2007; Soulé, 2003; Thomas, 1981), applied
in the particular setting. In fact, a pair of positive cycles inter-
secting in a particular way is required for a network to be
non-injective (Banaji and Craciun, 2009; Craciun and Feinberg,
2006).

3.2 Power-law kinetics

Power-law kinetics is a general class of kinetics that includes
mass-action kinetics. Typically, they appear as approximations
to actual kinetics, for example, in chemical mass-action systems
where some reactions are fast, or in systems with spatially con-
strained reactions (non-homogeneous media) (Bajzer et al., 2008;
Kopelman, 1998; Schnell and Turner, 2004). They have been
advocated as reasonable approximations to the kinetics in gen-
eral (Savageau, 1998). The reaction rates take the functional
form

Ku(c) = kuc‘f‘“1 - -c;"~",

where ku >0 is a constant and vu 6 IR". Note that the exponents
vu are allowed to be non-integer and also negative. Mass-action
kinetics is a power-law kinetics with positive integer exponents
speciﬁed by the stoichiometric coefﬁcients of the reactant com-
plexes. Theorem 1 can be refined to determine if the function g is
injective over any stoichiometric class for any choice of ku and
ﬁxed v“. The kinetic order matrix V is the m x n matrix with the
vector vu in the u-th row. Let diag(a1, . . . , a,.) denote the diagonal
matrix with diagonal entries a1, ...,a,.. Consider symbolic vec-
tors k: (k1, ...,kn) and z: (21, ...,zm) and let
M: Adiag(z)Vdiag(k). Let {(01, ...,a)”’} be a basis of the left
kernel of A and i1, ..., id row indices as above. We deﬁne an
n x n matrix, M*, by replacing the ij-th row of M by mi. The
matrix M* is a symbolic matrix in 2* and k*.

THEOREM 2. (Wiuf and Feliu, 2013) The interaction network
with power-law kinetics and ﬁxed kinetic orders is injective if
and only if M* is signinon-singular.

Consider example (2) again and assume mass-action kinetics.
Then k 2 (k1, . . . ,k4), Z = (Z1, . . . ,Z4),

1 0 1 0
0 0 0 1
V— 0 0 0 1 ’
0 1 1 0

_ 0 —k2Z4 —k3Z4 k4Z3
M*_ 0 0 1 1

k121 k224 k3(Zl+Z4) —k4(Zz+Z3)

The matrix M * in the mass-action setting and in the qualitative
setting is similar. The essential difference is that the entries zM in
the qualitative setting decompose into a product of two vectors
z,k in the mass-action setting. The determinant of M* is
k1k2Z1Z4 + k2k3Z1Z4 + k1k3Z1Z4 + k2k4Z2Z4 + k1k4Z1Z3 and the
network is injective, in agreement with the conclusion of the
qualitative analysis.

4 IMPLEMENTATION

The conditions of the theorems can be checked with software for

symbolic manipulation, such as Mathematica or Maple. This

software has efﬁcient built-in functions to compute the rank,

kernel and determinant of a matrix, as well as functions to

manipulate polynomials and perform Gaussian elimination.
The algorithm proceeds through the following steps:

(i) Compute the matrix M: AZ or M = Adiag(z) Vdiag(k).
(ii) Find a basis {(01, . . . , cod} of the left kernel of A and reduce
it by Gaussian elimination.
(iii) Construct M*: For each j determine the ﬁrst non-zero
entry i]- of the mi and replace the iJ-th row of M by wi.
(iv) Compute the determinant of M* as a function of Z“ or 2*:

(a) If it is identically zero, then the network is not injective.

(b) If there are non-zero terms in the determinant, extract
the signs of the coefﬁcients. If all signs are the same, the
interaction network is injective. If they are not, then
the interaction network is not injective.

The generic script in Maple is provided and exempliﬁed with
model (8) (see Section 5) in the Supplementary Data S1 (or
Supplementary Data S2 for the pdf version of the code). The
computational cost of the algorithm depends on the computation
of the determinant of a symbolic matrix of size n and its expan-
sion as a polynomial in 2H or 2*. The first step is fast for sparse
matrices, which is often the case, as each species usually is
involved in few reactions. The cost of the second step increases
with the number of terms in the entries of M*

Laplace expansion of the determinant can be used to reduce
the cost of computation. Let I = {i1, ..., ik} g {1, ..., n} be a set

of row indices and |I| 2 21:1  For any n x n matrix B, we have

det(B) = (—1)"| Z (—1)|" det(B,,J)det(B,L-,JL-)
ng, ...,n}

where IC = {1, . . . , n}\I (similarly for f) and B], J is the matrix B
restricted to the rows in I and columns in J (similarly for BF, 1.).
Hence, det(B) can be computed from nl/(kl(n — k)l) pairs of de-
terminants of size, k and n—k, respectively. Additionally, if a
sign contradiction is reached after inspecting set J then the com-
putation can be interrupted as the network cannot be injective in
this case.

It is worth emphasizing that for a speciﬁc system there might
be row/column operations that can be done on M* to simplify
the computation of det(M*).

5 TEST

We tested the algorithm on a multisite phosphorylation system
with r sites and inﬂuences derived from mass-action kinetics
(Wang and Sontag, 2008). The system has m = 6r reactions
and n = 3(r + 1) species (Supplementary Data S1). For
1<r<8 (resp. r=1), the algorithm easily concludes that the
system is not injective (resp. injective). However, the algorithm
collapses on a common computer for r: 8 due to memory allo-
cation problems (Table 1). This indicates that the algorithm is
not suited for large networks but can be applied efficiently for
moderately sized networks.

The matrix M* has n — 3 rows with symbolic entries and three
rows with integer entries, corresponding to the conservation
laws. We expand det(M*) along the three rows with integer
entries. Then, b 2: det(BU) is a 3 x 3 numerical determinant
and the symbolic determinant det(BIL-Jc) is only computed if
b 74 0.

Table 1 shows the running time using direct computation of
the determinant and using expansion along the rows of the con-
servation laws. We first expand the determinant before conclud-
ing on injectivity. The second method can be stopped as soon as
two terms are found with contradicting signs, in which case we
conclude that the system is non-injective.

By expanding along the rows of the conservation laws, we can
decide on injectivity for up to r: 17, in which case M* is a
54 x 54 matrix. Expansion of the determinant generates a
memory allocation error for r: 18. We could proceed to
expand along more rows (or columns) but these would be sym-
bolic now. The running time would increase as the number of
determinants to compute increases.

6 APPLICATIONS

The method is suited for screening large sets of interaction net-
works to detect those that have the potential for multistationar-
ity. This is illustrated in two different examples. In the ﬁrst, we
generate all possible small motifs of sRNA-mediated gene regu-
lation. In the second, we consider two databases of models of
biological systems.

6.1 RNA interference motifs

sRNAs have been demonstrated to regulate gene expression in
RNA interference (Bartel, 2004; Cullen, 2005), but the mechan-
ism is not fully understood and only few mathematical models

have been proposed (Cuccato et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2011;
Mitarai et al., 2007; Zhdanov, 2008, 2009, 2011).

In Mitarai et al. (2007), the sRNA R negatively regulates the
mRNA M by binding to it, and the degradation of the complex is
triggered. In addition, there is a protein complex F that represses
the transcription of R and, consequently, F acts as an activator of
M through a double negative loop. The model incorporates con-
sumption of F, enhanced by the presence of M. The species con-
centrations change according to the following system of ODEs:

mef . aR

 

fzaF—Sp —8Rr—yrm,

__’ r
f+K 1+ (8)
mzaM—SMm—yrm,

with (1*, 8*, y,“ K > 0. Note that F inﬂuences negatively the
production of R, that is, the reaction 0 —> R. The interaction
network of this model is shown in Figure 2b.

We focus on the negative regulatory mechanism induced by
repression of either mRNA or its product (Liu et al., 2011) and
build qualitative models. In post-transcriptional repression,
sRNA binds to mRNA and the complex is degraded. In trans-
lational repression, sRNA binds to the protein F and blocks its
function. We generate all interaction networks consisting of three
species: sRNA (R), mRNA (Ill) and a molecule F, which is either
the protein blocked by sRNA or a molecule involved in regula-
tion of sRNA or mRNA.

The generated interaction networks share a ﬁxed backbone,
depending on whether post-transcriptional or translational
repression is considered (Fig. 2a). Each species has positive
inﬂuence on its own degradation, that is, the reaction

(degradation) rate increases with increasing concentration. This
is also the case for the joint degradation of M and R, and of R
and F. For the two modes of repression, we allow F to inﬂuence
(positively, negatively or neutrally) the formation of M and R,
and M and R to inﬂuence positively the degradation of F. The
possibility that M enhances the production of F is optional in
post-transcriptional repression and assumed in translational re-
pression. In the latter, F is the protein translated from M. This
leads to two scenarios A and B (Fig. 2c).

In total, there are 243 interaction networks, 162 for scenario A
and 81 for scenario B (Fig. 2c). We find that 56 (reps. 15) of the
interaction networks in scenario A (reps. B).

Non-injectivity is preserved when adding edges to a non-in-
jective interaction network. In Figure 2c, we show the minimal
non-injective interaction networks for each scenario. An inter-
action network that does not contain any of these motifs is in-
jective and cannot have multiple positive steady states, whatever
the choice of rate functions. The models in Mitarai et al. (2007)
and Zhdanov (2009, Section 4) are both injective. In the latter,
multistationarity does not exist for the speciﬁc choice of rate
functions (Zhdanov, 2009, Section 4). Here we conclude that
the reason for this is independent of the choice and is, in fact,
a property of the interaction network. The main model in
Zhdanov (2009) is motif a.1 and the two models in Liu et al.
(2011) contain motifs a2 and b.3. These ﬁndings are consistent
with the results in Zhdanov (2009) and Liu et al. (2011), where it
is shown that the systems exhibit multistationarity for speciﬁc
rate functions. The motifs in Liu et al. (2011) are not minimal
with this property.

6.2 Screening models in Biomodels and KEGG

In this section, we apply the method to screen selected models in
two publicly available databases: KEGG [Kanehisa and Goto
(2000), http://www.kegg.jp/] and Biomodels [Li et al. (2010),
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels-main/]. Specifically, we use the
models in the database PoCaB (Samal et al., 2012), which con-
sists of 365 models from Biomodels and 103 models from KEGG
with organism code hsa (Homo sapiens). The database PoCaB
contains pre-computed stoichiometric matrices, mass-action
exponent matrices and kinetic data from the selected models.

We analyzed the models from Biomodels in two different
ways. Firstly, we imposed mass-action kinetics on all models
and checked whether they are injective or not. Secondly, using
Maple functionality, we automatically extracted the inﬂuence
matrices of the reported kinetics. This step is not possible for
all models because some kinetics are not monotone. There are
323 models (out of 365) for which the inﬂuence matrix could be
computed.

The models from KEGG have no associated kinetic data. We
analyzed the models first assuming mass-action kinetics and
afterward assuming that the inﬂuences are derived from mass-
action kinetics.

Both databases contain models of varying size (Fig. 3). The
injectivity test is easily computed for the smallest systems using
the direct approach. A rough cut-off for being small is that the
number of reactions is below 33. The computation of det(M*) for
the larger models requires expansion of the determinant. We
noticed that the matrix M* often contains rows/columns with

only one non-zero entry. If the non-zero entry is a polynomial
with coefﬁcients with distinct signs, then the network is not in-
jective. If this is not the case, then the row and column corres-
ponding to this non-zero entry can be removed from M *, thereby
simplifying M* by one dimension. We repeat this procedure it-
eratively until no row/column can be removed. This process re-
duces the size of M*, but it also makes the matrix less sparse.
Hence the computation of the determinant can still be computa-
tionally expensive.

Table 2 and Figure 3 provide a summary of the results.
Detailed information is given in Supplementary Data S3. Non-
injective networks for which det(M*) = 0 identically are reported
separately. For the Biomodels database, in all but 14 cases,
det(M*) is identically zero because there are species in the
model that do not inﬂuence any reaction (contributing a zero
column in Al) and this is not compensated by the conservation
laws. A detailed analysis of each speciﬁc model might reveal that
the model should be appropriately modiﬁed.

The results in Table 2 show that the method could decide on
injectivity on a large fraction of the networks. A network can be
injective when taken with mass-action kinetics but non-injective
when taken with general rate functions compatible with mass-
action kinetics. This is the case for the KEGG data, but not the
Biomodels data, where the general inﬂuences not necessarily are
compatible with mass-action kinetics. Hence the injectivity tests
for mass-action kinetics and general inﬂuences are not necessar-
ily related.

7 DISCUSSION

We have developed and implemented a computationally efﬁcient
and simple method to qualitatively assert whether a network

Inference on multistationarity

 

cannot exhibit multistationarity. The approach embraces a broad
class of dynamical systems by allowing for conservation laws and
arbitrary inﬂuences. Our method decides whether an interaction
network is injective or not. If it is injective, it can at most have
one positive steady state within each stoichiometric class.

Qualitative inference relies solely on the structure of the inter-
action network. This approach to inference has the particular
strength of freeing the analysis from any speciﬁc ODE system
and to highlight the generality of a conclusion (or property). In
our context, it is surprising that the exclusion of multistationarity
can be so strongly encoded in the network structure (reactions
and inﬂuences) alone and be independent of the speciﬁc form of
the rate functions, even if these involve complicated and non-
linear terms.

An overview of different methods to preclude and/or assert
multistationarity is provided in Table 3. Our algorithm is in the
class of injectivity-based criteria to preclude multistationarity. In
the context of chemical reaction network theory, these criteria
generally fall in two groups, Jacobian-based methods (Banaji
et al., 2007; Craciun and Feinberg, 2005, 2010; Feliu and Wiuf,
2012; Gnacadja, 2012; J oshi and Shiu, 2012) and graphical meth-
ods (Banaji and Craciun, 2010, 2009; Craciun and Feinberg,
2006; Soule, 2003). These apply to different specializations of

Table 2. For each category (row) the percentage of networks and the
average number of species in the networks are shown

networks and rate functions, such as mass-action kinetics or spe-
ciﬁc inﬂuences, and can be seen as specializations of our method
(Wiuf and Feliu, 2013). The graphical conditions are derived
from conditions on the Jacobian and would therefore preclude
multistationarity in fewer cases than a corresponding J acobian-
based method.

A different criterion (a sign condition) to characterize injective
networks is given in Shinar and Feinberg (2012) for some speciﬁc
inﬂuences. Their deﬁnition of a compatible rate function is less
restrictive than ours and corresponds, in our setting, to treat
classes of inﬂuences together (Wiuf and Feliu, 2013).

If the kinetics is restricted to mass-action, there exist methods
that complement injectivity-based methods in that multistatio-
narity not only can be precluded, but also asserted. The main
methods in this class are given in Table 3. Other methods include
an injectivity-based method applicable to weakly reversible net-
works (Otero-Muras et al., 2012) and a study of embedded net-
works (Joshi and Shiu, 2013).

We applied our method to a large class of models of gene
silencing by RNA interference. The method ran efficiently on
this set. Further, we observed that the non-existence of multi-
stationarity reported for some of the motifs for speciﬁc choices of
rate functions (Zhdanov, 2009) has a qualitative origin.
Subsequently, we applied our method to two databases of bio-
logical models and showed that the method could decide on
injectivity for a large fraction of the models. It is remarkable
that a large proportion of the networks is injective and hence
cannot exhibit multistationarity.

Existence of multistationarity is often asserted from random
parameter search, assuming the rate functions take a generic
form. However, exclusion of multistationarity cannot be decided
from a finite number of sampled parameter values alone.
Further, the result might depend strongly on how the parameters
are sampled. Our method provides an automatized procedure to
assert that multistationarity cannot occur. It provides an add-
itional tool to various other available softwares to address multi-
stationarity (Table 3). For mass-action kinetics, other softwares
exist to extract various network characteristics, e. g. Szederkenyi
et al. (2012).

Non-injectivity is a necessary condition for an interaction
network to exhibit multiple positive steady states. Hence, it is
possible that a network is non-injective without being multista-
tionary. In practice, however, we have observed that a non-
injective interaction network generally enables a choice of rate
functions and parameters for which multistationarity occurs.
Prospective work will focus on investigating under what condi-
tions this is true and, if it is the case, how the rate functions and
parameters can be constructed.

Typical ODE models, such as SIR models and the Lotkai
Volterra model, can be put in the framework of an interaction
network, even though the model is derived from a different per-
spective. Interpretation of ODE models as interaction networks
with potential non-realistic (hypothetical) reactions might seem
artiﬁcial. However, it highlights an important aspect, namely
that of freeing the system from a speciﬁc choice of ODEs.
Bearing in mind the difﬁculties in choosing the ‘correct’ system
of ODEs, we see this aspect as a strong advantage of our method
and encourage the modeling community to consider qualitative
inference broadly with the aim of separating model speciﬁcities
from structural properties.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: RNA-Seq is increasingly being used for differential gene
expression analysis, which was dominated by the microarray technol-
ogy in the past decade. However, inferring differential gene expression
based on the observed difference of RNA-Seq read counts has unique
challenges that were not present in microarray-based analysis. The
differential expression estimation may be biased against low read
count values such that the differential expression of genes with high
read counts is more easily detected. The estimation bias may further
propagate in downstream analyses at the systems biology level if it is
not corrected.

Results: To obtain a better inference of differential gene expression,
we propose a new efficient algorithm based on a Markov random field
(MRF) model, called MRFSeq, that uses additional gene coexpression
data to enhance the prediction power. Our main technical contribution
is the careful selection of the clique potential functions in the MRF so
its maximum a posterion' estimation can be reduced to the well-known
maximum flow problem and thus solved in polynomial time. Our ex-
tensive experiments on simulated and real RNA-Seq datasets demon-
strate that MRFSeq is more accurate and less biased against genes
with low read counts than the existing methods based on RNA-Seq
data alone. For example, on the well-studied MAQC dataset, MRFSeq
improved the sensitivity from 11.6 to 38.8% for genes with low read
counts.

1 INTRODUCTION

Next-generation sequencing technologies have been widely used
in genomics research. RNA-Seq, one of the most exciting appli-
cations of next-generation sequencing technologies, is used to
reveal the complexity of tanscriptomes in biological systems
(Wang et al., 2009). Many unprecedented discoveries are being
made by RNA-Seq, such as the inference of novel isoforms,
characterization of the modes of antisense regulation and study
of intergenic expression patterns (Carninci et al., 2005; Graveley
et al., 2011; Nagalakshmi et al., 2008; Trapnell et al., 2010).

In recent years, RNA-Seq has taken a major role in the quanti-
tative analysis of gene expression and transcript variant discov-
ery. In the past decade, most of these applications were
dominated by microarray-based technologies. In these quantita-
tive assays, RNA populations are partially sequenced and the
obtained read sequences are aligned back to the reference
genome. The aligned reads are then assigned to genes based on
the common regions that they share in the alignment. The
number of reads assigned to a gene is called the read count of
the gene, which has been shown to be nearly linearly correlated
with the expression level of a gene (Marioni et al., 2008).

Differential gene expression analysis is to identify if genes ex-
press differently between biological conditions of interest. Given
RNA-Seq read count data, detecting differentially expressed
(DE) or equally expressed (EE) genes can be done by checking
if the observed difference of the read counts is significant or not,
i.e. greater than some natural random variation. To test the sig-
niﬁcance of the difference between RNA-Seq read counts, the
distribution of read counts was first assumed to be Poisson in
(Marioni et al., 2008; Srivastava and Chen, 2010; Wang et al.,
2010). However, the Poisson distribution may underestimate the
variance of read counts and cause unexpected false positives in
differential gene expression analysis (Nagalakshmi et al., 2008;
Robinson and Smyth, 2007). To solve the problem, negative bi-
nomial distributions were applied to RNA-Seq read data
(Anders and Huber, 2010; Robinson and Smyth, 2007, 2008;
Robinson et al., 2010) and have become the state-of-the-art stat-
istical model. Other than the methods based on the Poisson or
negative binomial distributions, two data-driven probabilistic
methods, baySeq (Hardcastle and Kelly, 2010) and NOISeq
(Tarazona et al., 2011), have also been proposed. Moreover,
given annotated or inferred mRNA transcripts (or isoforms) of
genes, some statistical methods for detecting differential expres-
sion at the transcript level have been published recently (Grifﬁth
et al., 2010; Li and Dewey, 2011; Trapnell et al., 2013; Zheng and
Chen, 2009). Because the expression level of a gene with known
(or inferred) isoforms can be calculated by simply summing up
the expression levels of its isoforms, these transcript-level meth-
ods can be used as alternative methods for detecting differential
expression of isoforms (Trapnell et al., 2013), although the
accuracy of these methods clearly depends on the quality of
the provided isoforms.

Although the statistical properties of RNA-Seq data have been
well studied and taken into account in the above statistical meth-
ods, these methods suffer from the following issues. First, it has
been observed that statistical power increases with read count

values (Oshlack and Wakefield, 2009; Oshlack et al., 2010;
Young et al., 2010). Note that the read count of a gene is pro-
portional to the gene expression level multiplied by the gene
length. As a result, long or highly expressed genes are more
likely to be detected as DE genes compared with their short
and/or lowly expressed counterparts. This bias in DE gene de-
tection is unavoidable even when normalization or rescaling is
applied to read count data (Oshlack and Wakeﬁeld, 2009; Young
et al., 2010). It is known that the selection bias on DE genes, if
uncorrected, may lead to biased downstream analyses (Oshlack
and Wakeﬁeld, 2009; Oshlack et al., 2010; Young et al., 2010).
Second, the dependency among the expression of genes is not
used in these methods. In gene expression analysis based on
microarray data, the prior knowledge of gene coexpression pat-
terns has been used to improve the performance of algorithms
for detecting phenotype-related pathways (Rahnenfuhrer et al.,
2004), searching for signiﬁcant pathway regulators (Sivachenko
et al., 2005), identifying differential gene expression patterns
(Jacob et al., 2012) and the classiﬁcation of microarray data
(Rapaport et al., 2007). In particular, to obtain more accurate
inference of DE genes, Wei and Li (Wei and Li, 2007) proposed a
Markov random ﬁeld (MRF) model that integrates the gamma-
gamma model based on microarray data (Kendziorski et al.,
2003; Newton et al., 2001) and gene coexpression networks ex-
tracted from KEGG pathways (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000) such
that DE genes can be determined by the maximum a posteriori
(MAP) estimation of the MRF model. Their experimental results
demonstrate that the additional gene coexpression information
can help detect more subtle changes of gene expression (e. g. local
disturbances within known pathways) and significantly improve
the overall prediction accuracy of DE genes (Wei and Li, 2007).
However, due to the difference between continuous microarray
intensity values and discrete RNA-Seq read counts, The MRF
model in (Wei and Li, 2007) cannot be applied to RNA-Seq data
immediately. Moreover, because the MAP estimation problem
for an MRF model is generally NP-Hard (Boykov, 2001), the
MRF model in (Wei and Li, 2007) was solved by a heuristic
method, iterated conditional modes, which provides an approxi-
mately optimal prediction with no conﬁdence scores.

In this work, we propose a novel MRF model, MRFSeq,
combining RNA-Seq read counts with the prior knowledge of
gene coexpression networks to infer DE genes. Different from
the MRF model in (Wei and Li, 2007), we choose the clique
potential functions of the MRF model carefully so that the
MAP estimation of DE genes can be reduced to the well-
known maximum ﬂow problem on ﬂow networks based on the
work of Kolmogorov and Zabih (Kolmogorov and Zabih, 2004).
Because the maximum ﬂow problem is polynomial-time solvable,
our MRF model can be solved exactly in polynomial time.
Moreover, we introduce a loopy belief propagation method
(Mooij, 2007; Weiss, 2000) to calculate the conﬁdence of each
inferred DE or EE gene. Our extensive experiments on simulated
and real RNA-Seq data demonstrate that MRFSeq achieves a
much improved overall estimation performance by gaining con-
siderable sensitivity without losing precision. A detailed analysis
of the prediction results indicates that the DE genes predicted by
MRFSeq are distributed more evenly across different values of
read counts than those recovered by the existing methods using
RNA-Seq data alone. Hence, MRFSeq can help alleviate the

selection bias of DE genes against genes with low read counts.
Our analysis further shows that most of the DE or EE genes that
can be correctly predicted from RNA-Seq data alone are also
correctly predicted by MRFSeq, implying that the use of the
prior knowledge of gene coexpression does not introduce new
biases in the differential analysis result. Moreover, we compare
MRFSeq with a recently published transcript-level method,
Cuffdiff 2 (Trapnell et al., 2013), on the real RNA-Seq data
using the annotated transcriptome from UCSC hg19 (Meyer
et al., 2013). The comparison shows that MRFSeq is much
more sensitive than Cuffdiff 2.

The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section 2.1
deﬁnes the terms and notations used in our algorithms, while
Section 2.2 provides the formulation of the MRF model and
the design of its clique potential functions. The reduction to
the maximum flow problem is shown in Section 2.3. The experi-
mental results are described in Section 3, which also contains a
comparison between MRFSeq and existing differential expres-
sion analysis methods including edgeR (Robinson et al., 2010),
DESeq (Anders and Huber, 2010), baySeq (Hardcastle and
Kelly, 2010), NOISeq (Tarazona et al., 2011) and Cuffdiff 2
(Trapnell et al., 2013). In particular, Section 3.4 compares the
performance of the methods on genes with low read counts and
shows that MRFSeq achieves not only an overall signiﬁcantly
higher accuracy but also provides a less biased prediction. A few
concluding remarks are given in Section 4. The loopy belief
propagation method for calculating the conﬁdence level of
each prediction as well as some figures and tables are omitted
in the main text owing to page limit and are provided in the
Supplementary Materials.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Terminology and notations

Let G = {g1, g2, ..., gn} be the genes to be tested for differential expression
and X = {x1, x2, ..., xn} the binary random variables such that each
x,- e {0, 1} indicates the DE state of gene g,. The random variable
x,- = 1 if the gene g,- is a DE gene and x,- = 0 indicates that the gene is
an EE gene. Two random variables x,- and x, are assumed to be correlated
if the two genes g,- and g, form a pair of coexpressed genes. A conﬁgur-
ation x is a (F1 assignment to the random variables X. Assume that there
are p and (1 replicates in the two conditions, A and B, of interest, respect-
ively. Let the read counts a; and b; be the number of the reads aligned to
gene g,- in the j-th replicate of the conditions A and B, respectively. For
each gene g,, two sets of the read counts R A,,- = {a], a3, ..., ai } and
R5,,— = {b’],b§, ...,b;
conditions A and B after mapping all the reads to the reference genome.
Popular statistical measurements for the observed difference of read
counts are the false discovery rates [FDRs, i.e. the p-value corrected
for multiple testing (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995)] and prior probabil-
ity. The current statistical methods infer DE genes by checking independ-
ently for each gene if the difference measurement of its read count exceeds
a certain threshold (Oshlack et al., 2010). In our method, DE genes are
determined by the conﬁguration that maximize a likelihood function of
both observed difference of read counts and gene coexpression while no
prior knowledge of the thresholds is required. MRFSeq uses, but is not
limited to, the FDR (1,- from DESeq (Anders and Huber, 2010) as the
difference measurement of the read counts RA, and RB, ,-, where
q,- 6 [0,1]. To improve the computational efﬁciency of our algorithm,
the FDR q,- is further discretized by binning the interval [0,1] into 20

intervals of the same length 0.05. Let y,- e {1, 2, . . . , 20} denote the inter-
val where the observed difference q, belongs to, and Y = {y1, y2, ..., y,,}
be, the collection of all the discretized FDRs. The joint probability of the
hidden variables X given its observed values Y is then formulated by an
MRF model, a graphical model capable of capturing the statistical de-
pendency of random variables (Kindermann and Snell, 1980), described
in the next subsection. Given the joint probability of X conditional to Y,
estimating the DE states of the genes actually involves two inference
problems. The ﬁrst is the MAP estimation problem, i.e. searching for a
conﬁguration x* such that Pr(x*| Y) is maximized. The algorithm for the
MAP estimation problem will be discussed later in the section. The
second is the marginal probability problem, i.e. computing the probability
Pr(xil Y) as a conﬁdence level of the conﬁguration on each gene g,. The
loopy belief propagation method for the marginal probability problem is
given in the Supplementary Materials.

2.2 MRF model

Let H = (VX,E) be an undirected graph representing the coexpression
network for G such that every node vx, e Vx is associated with the
random variables x,- e X and every edge (i, j) shared by the nodes vx,
and vx, encodes the dependency of the two correlated random variables
x,- and x,. Two variables x,- and x, are assumed to be correlated if the two
genes g,- and g, are coexpressed. To determine which pair of the genes are
the coexpressed genes, the correlation coefﬁcient cw- deﬁned in
COXPREdb (Obayashi and Kinoshita, 2011) is used as the measurement
of gene coexpression between the two genes g,- and g,. Two genes are
considered as a pair of coexpressed genes if cm- is greater than a threshold
p. We use p = 0.5 throughout this work because it is widely used in the
literature (Patil et al., 2011; Watson, 2006).

In our model, we think that the DE state of each gene should depend
on its observed difference in read counts and the DE states of its coex-
pressed genes. In other words, we can assume that every random variable
is conditionally independent to the variables indexed by non-adjacent
vertices in H. Hence, the following property is satisﬁed:

Pr(XilX) = Pr(Xilxj, Vx, E N(Vx,-))a (1)

where N(vx/.) represents the neighbors of vx, in H. By the Hammersleye
Clifford theorem (Besag, 1974), a joint distribution of the random vari-
ables X given Y can be factorized as a form of clique potential functions
TC(C), the positive functions for conﬁgurations over cliques in the given
graph H such that Pr(X| Y) = HCEH TC(C).

To model the pairwise dependency between coexpressed genes, we may
use an MRF model consisting of only potential functions for cliques of
sizes at most 2. This type of MRF is called the pairwise MRF (Besag,
1986) and will be used in our work. There are two types of potential
functions adopted in our MRF model. One is the unary functions
¢,(x,-) that score how compatible the random variable x,- is with its
observed evidence y,-. The other is the pairwise potential functions
1110-, J)(x,-, xj) that measure the statistical dependency between every pair
of correlated variables x,- and x,. By the deﬁnition of the potential func-
tions, the joint distribution of X given Y can be written as

n
HGU9=% H WmUﬁMNIWUd (D
(i,})EE i:1
where Z is the normalized term to assure that the joint probability
Pr(X|Y) sums up to 1. Let P0,” = Pr(x, = 1|y,-) and Pam =
Pr(x, 2 0| y,-). The unary function ¢,(x,-) is deﬁned as follows:

P(1,o/P(0,i), if P(1,o >P(0,i), Xi = 1
(MM) = P(0,n/P(1,i), 1f P(0,o >P(1,i), Xi = 0 (3)
1, otherwise,

To calculate the unary functions, the ratio between the two prior prob-
abilities Pr(x,=1|y,—) and Pr(x, = 0|y,-) should be given as a known

parameter in our MRF model. To estimate the parameter, the read
counts of four replicates (two per condition) for 10000 DE genes and
10 000 BE genes are ﬁrst synthesized. Our simulation of the read counts
of the DE and EE genes follows the same steps as used in the simulation
study of DESeq (Anders and Huber, 2010). For the DE genes, the log
fold change rate of the observed read counts between two conditions is
randomly drawn from the normal distribution with mean 0 and variance
0.7. For the BE genes, the mean is set to be 0 and the variance 0.2. After
the simulation of read counts, the discretized FDRs introduced previ-
ously are calculated as the observed difference in the synthesized read
counts. Assume that there are my, DE genes and n,,., EE genes whose
discretized FDR is y,- in this simulation. We further assume the equality
of the two background probabilities of x,- holds, i.e.
Pr(x, = 1) = Pr(x, = 0). By Baye’s rule, the ratio of the prior probabil-
ities is obtained as follows:

“(E = Olyi) _ Pr(J’ilxi = 0)Pr(xi = 0) _ "y,-
Pr(xi = llyi) — Pr(J/ilxi=1)Pr(Xi=1)— my; ,

 

 

(4)

Symmetrically, we have Pr(x, = 1|y,-)/Pr(x,- 2 0| y,-) = myi/nyi.

For the pairwise function 1110-, J)(x,-,xj) of every pair of coexpressed
genes g,- and g,, the correlation coefﬁcient cw- deﬁned in COXPREdb
(Obayashi and Kinoshita, 2011) is used as the measure of the statistical
dependency between x,- and x,. The pairwise potential functions are thus
deﬁned as follows:

If Xi = Xj,
otherwise,

¢anUh%)={ 1 (9
This completes the speciﬁcation of the joint distribution of X. To facili-
tate the presentation of our algorithms, the joint distribution of X can be
rewritten by taking negative logarithm on both sides of Equation (2) as
below:

i=1 (LbeE
where y is a constant, or,(x,—) = ln¢,—(x,—) and ,B(,-,j)(x,-, xj) = [ml/(win, xj).
E(X| Y) is called the pseudo-energy function when each or,- is a unary term
and each [So-,1) is a pairwise term of the energy. A conﬁguration maximiz-
ing the joint probability Pr(X| Y) is actually the conﬁguration minimizing
the pseudo-energy function E(X| Y) (Besag, 1986).

2.3 MAP Estimation

Different from the heuristic method, iterated conditional modes, used to
approximate the MAP of the MRF model of Wei and Li (2007), we show
in this subsection that, by designing the potential functions in MRFSeq
carefully, the MAP estimation problem for MRFSeq is no longer an NP-
Hard problem because it can be reduced to the maximum ﬂow problem
on ﬂow networks and solved optimally in polynomial time.

A random variable x,- is said to be inverted by a conﬁguration x if the
state assignment to x,- violates its prior probability, i.e. x,- = 1 if
Pr(Xi = Olyi)>Pr(Xi=1|yi) 0r Xi = 0 if Pr(Xi=1|yi)>Pr(Xi= Oil/1')-
For an inverted random variable x,, or,(x,—) = 0 instead of
|ln¢>,—(1) — ln¢,—(0)|. We define |ln¢>,—(1) — ln¢,—(0)| as the cost of the inver-
sion. Two correlated variables x,- and x, are said to be separated by a
conﬁguration x if the assigned states of x,- and x, are different, i.e. x,- 75 xj.
For a pair of separated variables x,- and x], ,B(,-,J)(x,-, xj) = 0 instead of cm.
The cost of the separation is CH. Kolmogorov and Zabih (2004) proved
that when the pairwise term ,B(,-,J)(x,-,xj) of the pseudo-energy function
E(X| Y) is submodular, that is, the following property is satisﬁed:

13021)“), 0) + 150,110, 1) 3 13(0)“), 1) + 150,110 a 0), (7)

searching for a conﬁguration that minimizes the pseudo-energy function
can be done by looking for a conﬁguration minimizing the total cost of
inversion and separation. That is, the MAP estimation problem on an

MRF model can be reduced to the maximum ﬂow (or minimum cut)
problem over a ﬂow newtwork H’ such that a minimum cut of H’ cor-
responds to a MAP estimation of the MRF model and the saturated
capacity of the cut is exactly the total cost of the inversion and separation.

It is easy to verify that our paiwise term is submodular.
,B(,-,j)(0, 0) + ,B(,-,j)(1, 1) sums up to 2cm, where cw- : 0.5, while
,B(,-,j)(0, 1) + ,B(,-,j)(1,0) is 0. The reduction from our MRF model whose
graph representation is H = (Vx, E) to the ﬂow network
H’ = (Vx U {s, t},E’) can be done as follows. The nodes of H’ are the
union of the nodes of H and two additional nodes, the source s and sink t.
Every undirected edge (i, j) of H is transformed into two directed edges
(i, ') and (i, ') with capacity cw. For every node x,, two directed edges (s, i)
and (i, t) are added to E’. The capacity of the edge (s, i) is
|ln¢>,—(1) — ln¢,—(0)| if Pr(x, = 1|y,-)>Pr(x,- 2 0| y,-). Otherwise, the capacity
of the edge (s, i) is 0. Symmetrically, the capacity of the edge (i, t) is
|ln¢>,—(1) — ln¢,—(0)| if Pr(x, 2 0| y,-)>Pr(x,- = 1|y,-). Otherwise, the capacity
of the edge (i, t) is 0. After running a standard maximum ﬂow algorithm,
e.g. the Edmond and Karp algorithm (Edmonds and Karp, 1972), on the
ﬂow network H’, a minimum cut Q = {V,Us, V, U{t}} is obtained,
where VY are the nodes adjacent to s and V, the nodes adjacent to t. It
represents a (F1 assignment such that all the random variables corres-
ponding to the nodes of VY are assigned 1 and all the random variables
corresponding to the nodes of V, are assign 0. Then, a gene g,- is inferred
as a DE gene if x,- is 1, or an EE gene otherwise.

2.4 RNA-Seq Datasets

Two publicly available human RNA-Seq datasets, the MAQC dataset
(Bullard et al., 2010; Shi et al., 2006) and Griffth’s dataset (Grifﬁth et al.,
2010), will be used as the benchmark datasets to assess the performance
of our selected differential gene expression analysis methods. Each of the
dataset is associated with an additional qRT-PCR dataset to validate the
DE states of genes. The MAQC dataset consists of two samples,
Ambion’s human brain reference RNA (brain) and Stratagene’s human
universal reference RNA. Each sample provides seven replicates and a
total of 45 million single-end RNA-Seq reads of length 35 bp. The read
counts for the MAQC dataset is obtained from 71 million uniquely
mapped reads calibrated by ReCounts (Frazee et al., 2011). Grifﬁth’s
dataset was made from the qRT-PCR validation for the DE or alterna-
tively expressed genes highlighted by ALEXA-Seq (Grifﬁth et al., 2010).
It contains 96 and 198 million pair-end reads across two human colorec-
tal cancer cell lines that only differ in ﬂuorouracil resistance phenotypes.
To equilibrate sequencing depth in both samples, as done in (Tarazona
et al., 2011), the read library size is set to be about 100 million reads per
condition. Raw RNA-Seq reads of the MAQC dataset were downloaded
from the SRA database (Leinonen et al., 2011), while the RNA-Seq reads
of Grifﬁth’s dataset were downloaded from the FTP site of the ALEXA-
Seq Web site. The gene association across platforms was performed with
BioMart (Zhang et al., 2011). Unmatched genes were discarded in down-
stream analysis steps. To obtain the read counts for Grifﬁth’s dataset, the
raw RNA-Seq reads were aligned against the high-coverage assembly of
the human genome UCSC th9 (Meyer et al., 2013) using Tophat
(Trapnell et al., 2009) where two mismatches were allowed and reads
mapped to multiple locations were removed. Finally, the read counts
for each gene in Grifﬁth’s dataset were summarized by using the R pack-
ages GenomicFeatures and RSamtools from Biooonductor along with the
genome annotation information from Ensembl (version 60) (Flicek et al.,
2011) and only exonic reads. For a fair comparison, a pseudo read count,
1, was applied to all genes with zero read counts to avoid the divided-by-
zero problem in some statistical calculations.

2.5 Evaluation Metrics

Following the assessment method of Bullard et a]. (2010), all our
experimental results are evaluated in terms of precision (PRE),

PRE = TP/(TP + FP) x 100%, and sensitivity (SEN), SEN 2 TP/
(TP + FN) x 100%, where TP is the number of true positives, FP the
number of false positives and FN the number of false negatives. To
combine the two evaluation measures, the F-score (FS)
(van Rijsbergen, 1979), deﬁned as FS 2 [2 x (PRE x SEN)/
(PRE + SEN)] x 100%, is used as a measure of the overall performance
of a prediction method in our tests.

3 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

3.1 Selection of differential gene expression analysis
methods

To compare our method with the existing gene differential ana-
lysis methods, the same selection criteria proposed by Tarazona
et al. (2011) was followed. However, Fisher’s exact test (Fisher,
1922), which was compared in (Tarazona et al., 2011), was
excluded here because its performance was shown to be far
lower than those of the other methods. At the end, four methods
including edgeR (Robinson et al., 2010), DESeq (Anders and
Huber, 2010), baySeq (Hardcastle and Kelly, 2010) and
NOISeq (Tarazona et al., 2011) were selected to be compared
in our tests. Note that NOISeq has two versions, NOISeq_real
and NOISeq_sim, and the version NOISeq_real is used in our
experiments because numbers of replicates in our simulated and
real datasets are always greater than one. Some reasonable cutoff
values are required in these methods (except MRFSeq) to decide
the signiﬁcance of a statistical difference measurement. To obtain
comparable performance analysis scenarios, the cutoff values
adopted in the literature are applied in our experiments. More
speciﬁcally, the FDR 0.1 chosen in DESeq is used for DESeq
and edgeR. We choose the probability 0.8 and 0.999, as done in
the work of Tarazona et al. (2011), for NOISeq and baySeq,
respectively. Experiments at two levels of difﬁculty are conducted
to compare our method MRFSeq with the other selected meth-
ods. At the first level, all read counts of the benchmark datasets
are generated from the same distribution as assumed in the simu-
lation studies of DESeq. At the second level, all read counts
of the genes are accumulated from the two real datasets, the
MAQC and Grifﬁth’s datasets, and may contain low read
counts. In addition to the comparisons with the gene-level meth-
ods, MRFSeq is also compared with the recently published tran-

3.2 Simulation studies

3.2.] Simulation experiments Our simulation experiments
follow the framework in (Wei and Li, 2007). All gene sets asso-
ciated with the 186 KEGG pathways in MSigDB (Subramanian
et al., 2005) were downloaded. The coexpression networks of the
186 gene sets were then deﬁned using COXPREdb (Obayashi
and Kinoshita, 2011) and they formed 186 undirected graphs.
A gene set was discarded if the number of the edges in its coex-
pression network is less than the number of the nodes. After the
filtration, 37 gene sets consisting of 2194 different genes were
kept. The 37 coexpression networks (see Supplementary Table
S1) were merged as a global network consisting of 2194 nodes
and 8512 edges. All the methods are tested at five different abun-
dance levels of true DE genes. The performance assessment is
categorized into ﬁve classes, where each class represents an

abundance level interval of 10% such that the five classes cover
abundance levels of DE genes ranging from 0 to 50% as done in
(Wei and Li, 2007). At each of the ﬁve levels, we randomly
choose 10 combinations of the pathways to form the sets of
true DE genes, while keeping the rest of the genes as true EE
genes, such that the percentage of the true DE genes is within the
range of the level. The 10 different combinations form 10 bench-
mark datasets and read counts are randomly obtained by f ollow-
ing the same steps for simulating read counts used in DESeq. The
simulated read counts range from 25 to 401. All the methods are
applied to the 50 benchmark datasets. Owing to the page limit,
the performance assessment on the first interval [0,10) is sum-
marized in Table 1 and the complete assessment on all five inter-
vals is presented in Supplementary Table S2. For the convenience
of the reader, the precision-sensitivity curves are also provided in
Supplementary Figure S1.

3.2.2 Comparisons of the methods on simulated data MRFSeq
has clearly the best F-scores (i.e. the overall performance) and
significantly improved sensitivity over the other methods. Its
F-score is 14.2, 6.8, 6.8, 3.7 and 4.8% greater than the second
best in the ﬁve interval, while its improvement on sensitivity is
13.6, 10.6, 9.1, 1.7 and 2%, respectively. Although baySeq pro-
vides close sensitivity scores in the intervals [30,40) and [40,50), it
fails to obtain comparable precision scores and hence has an
inferior overall performance. While achieving a considerable
improvement on sensitivity in the interval [0,10), MRFSeq im-
proves the precision by at least 6.9%. In the other four intervals,
MRFSeq’s precision is slightly lower than those of the other
methods. The difference between the precision of MRFSeq and
the best precision in these intervals is 2.3, 1.4, 2.2 and 1%, re-
spectively, which are actually smaller than the standard devi-
ations. The standard deviations of the sensitivity and F-score
of MRFSeq are greater than the standard deviations of the
other methods. This is because the performance of MRFSeq is
somewhat correlated to the topological distributions of the true
DE genes on the coexpression network. The amount of im-
provement achieved by MRFSeq may vary depending on the
topological distribution. Nevertheless, the simulation results
demonstrate that coexpression data could help improve differen-
tial gene expression analysis by increasing the coverage of true
DE genes significantly.

3.3 Performance on real RNA-Seq data

3.3.] Experiments on the MAQC dataset In addition to the
previous simulation study, the performance for inferring DE
genes is assessed on the MAQC dataset. Previously, Tarazona
et al. (2011) tested the selected methods on different numbers of
replicates (or lanes), from 2 replicates to 7 replicates per condi-
tion, in the MAQC dataset to see how sequencing depth would
affect the performance of the methods. The results indicated that
increasing the sequencing depth would decrease the precision of
all selected methods except NOISeq. To compare the perform-
ance and understand how the precision of MRFSeq would
change as the sequencing depth increases, the experiments de-
signed by Tarazona et al. are used in our work. Different num-
bers of replicates are considered such that the read library size
varies from 14 to 45 million reads in each of the two samples.
The expression levels of the genes in the MAQC dataset were
measured by the normalized threshold cycle values (CT) of qRT-
PCR. To validate the true DE genes of the MAQC dataset, a
gene is deﬁned as a true DE gene if the log2 fold change ratio
(LR) of its CT values is greater than a certain threshold b, e. g. 0.5
or 2, while a gene is a true EE gene if its LR is smaller than
threshold a, e.g. 0.2 (Bullard et al., 2010). Any gene whose LR is
between the two thresholds a and b is considered as a borderline
gene. In the previous studies, all borderline genes were discarded
(Bullard et al., 2010; Tarazona et al., 2011). Owing to the detec-
tion limitation of qRT-PCR, lowly expressed genes may be
absent in some of the qRT-PCR assays. A gene that was detected
in at least one of the qRT-PCR assays would also be removed if
it failed to appear in at least three-fourth of the qRT-PCR assays
(Bullard et al., 2010). Different from the previous studies, we do
not throw away those borderline genes. To further test the infer-
ence power on genes with low read counts, lowly expressed genes
are also kept in our experiments. This gives us a total of 836
genes. We deﬁne a gene as a true DE gene if its LR is larger than
the threshold b. Otherwise, the gene is a true EE gene. There are
669 true DE genes when the threshold b is set to be 0.5 and 373
true DE genes when b is 2.0. The coexpression network of the
836 genes forms a graph of 836 nodes and 2426 edges. All the
methods are tested at these two different abundance levels
(or LR values) of DE genes. The prediction results are again
assessed in terms of precision, sensitivity and F-score as summar-
ized in Figure 1.

3.3.2 Comparison of the performance on the MAQC
dataset Similar to the results in the simulation study,
MRFSeq achieves signiﬁcantly improved sensitivity scores and
F-scores at both abundance levels of true DE genes. The im-
provement on sensitivity is at least 9.2 and 8.8% for all sequen-
cing depths considered when b=0.5 and 2, respectively. While
achieving the best sensitivity scores, the precision scores of
MRFSeq are also comparable with the precision of the others
except NOISeq who exhibits extremely high precision. Note that
although NOISeq has the best precision among all methods, its
sensitivity is much lower than the scores of the others and its
overall performance (as measured by F-score) suffers from this.
As the sequence depth increases, the precision of NOISeq re-
mains stable while all other methods lose some precision. The
precision of DESeq drops 4.0 and 4.7%, respectively, for the two

measures. In the upper row of plots, the LR threshold b is set as 0.5 and in the lower row b=2.0. Plots (a) and ((1) compare the precision scores at
different sequence depths. Plots (b) and (e) depict the sensitivity scores, while plots (c) and (1') illustrate the F-scores

values of b, when the number of replicates increases from two to
seven. The decrease in precision is 5.4 and 6% for baySeq, while
edgeR loses 2.0 and 2.6%. At the same time, the precision of
MRFSeq only decreases 1.6 and 2.8%. The relative small loss of
the precision for MRFSeq can be explained by the fact that
many false positives, if not predicted at a strong conﬁdence
level, could be eliminated by MRFSeq using the coexpression
information. Hence, these results on the MAQC dataset show
that coexpression information not only helps gaining more
coverage of the true DE genes but also keeps precision relatively
stable against the increase of sequencing depth. Moreover, it
could help reduce our reliance on deeply covered RNA-Seq
data in differential gene expression analysis.

3.3.3 Taking confidence scores into consideration Like the
FDRs of DESeq and edgeR or the prior probability of baySeq
and NOISeq, MRFSeq estimates the conﬁdence (i.e. marginal
probability) for each predicted DE gene and a conﬁdence thresh-
old can be applied to select DE genes for the output (instead of
following the MAP estimation algorithm). We are interested in
the performance of MRFSeq on the MAQC dataset when dif-
ferent thresholds are applied to the conﬁdence. To calculate the
confidence scores, the loopy belief propagation algorithm is run
on all seven replicates in the MAQC dataset. To compare the
performance of MRFSeq with the other methods, a precision-
sensitiVity curve where each point represents the precision and
sensitivity under a certain threshold, is depicted for each of the
selected methods, as done in (Tarazona et al., 2011). To depict
the precision-sensitivity curves for DESeq and edgeR the range
of the FDR threshold from 10’6 to 1 is selected. Note that this
range for FDR cutoffs covers all the threshold values used in
practice and these FDR thresholds yield sensitivity values be-
tween 45 and 100%. For the other methods that do not use
FDRs, equivalent thresholds that lead to sensitivity within the
same range, i.e. 4&100%, are applied to draw the precision-
sensitiVity curves. The precision-sensitivity curves in
Supplementary Figure S2 show that, in general, MRFSeq

provides more accurate confidence scores than the other meth-
ods. Note that unlike the MAP estimation algorithm, using the
marginal probabilities obtained by the loopy belief propagation
algorithm to infer DE genes requires additional knowledge to
choose an approproate conﬁdence (marginal probability) thresh-
old. Besides, the loopy belief propagation algorithm is a heuristic
and thus does not guarantee correct marginal probabilities.
Hence, MRFSeq uses the MAP estimation to select DE genes
and the loopy belief propagation algorithm only to estimate the
conﬁdence score of each selected DE gene.

3.3.4 Comparisons of the performance on Grifﬁth’s dataset The
qRT-PCR data of Grifﬁth’s dataset consists of 193 exon assays
on 94 protein coding genes. Different from the LR of the MAQC
dataset, a two-tailed t-test was applied to identify the true DE
genes from the qRT-PCR data of Grifﬁth’s dataset. A P—Value of
the t-test was considered significant if it is smaller than 0.05
(Grifﬁth et al., 2010). Under this criterion, 83 true DE genes
and 11 true EE genes are identiﬁed and used in testing the se-
lected methods. The coexpression network of the 94 genes ex-
tracted from COXPREdb forms a graph of 94 nodes and 25
edges. The performance of the methods on Grifﬁth’s dataset is
shown in Supplementary Table S3. MRFSeq still has the best
overall performance, although its improvement over the other
methods is not as signiﬁcant as on the MAQC data. Please see
the Supplementary Materials for a detailed discussion.

3.4 Performance on genes with low read counts

3.4.1 Genes with low read counts To understand how the meth-
ods perform on genes with different read count levels, the pre-
diction on the real datasets is further analyzed. The genes in the
datasets are separated into two classes, genes with low read
counts and genes with decent read counts. In (Bullard et al.,
2010), a gene is said to have a low read count if it has fewer
than 10 reads in every replicate of the two conditions. Otherwise,
the gene is said to have a decent read count. Because Grifﬁth’s

MRFSeq

 

dataset contains only genes with decent read counts, we consider
the MAQC dataset only below. Among the 836 genes in the
MAQC dataset, there are 453 genes with low read counts and
383 genes with decent read counts. The methods baySeq and
NOISeq provide an additional option for normalizing gene
lengths. These two methods with normalized gene lengths are
denoted as baySeqlen and NOISeqlm, respectively. To further
study the effect of the normalization on genes with low read
counts, baySeqlen and NOISeQIE,1 are also applied to the
MAQC dataset. By choosing a threshold of b = 0.5 for the LR
values, the prediction results on genes with low read counts by
different methods are compared in Table 2. The detailed num-
bers of true and predicted DE genes with low or decent read
counts are listed in Supplementary Table S4.

3.4.2 Signiﬁcant improvement on genes with low read counts On
the genes with low read counts, the sensitivity of MRFSeq is
38.8%, while the second best sensitivity is only 11.6%.
Similarly, MRFSeq achieves an F-score of 53.3%, while the
second best F-score is only 20.4%. In addition to these signiﬁ-
cant improvements, the prediction of MRFSeq shows a more
balanced pattern between genes with low read counts and
genes with decent read counts. The RTPl/h of MRFSeq is
43.1% while its RPPl/h is 42.7%. The second best RTPl/h and
RPPl/h are only 13.0 and 13.3% (obtained by edgeR). This result
shows that all the other methods are biased against genes with
low read counts. Most of their predicted DE genes are from the
genes with decent read counts. After applying the normalization
of gene lengths on genes with low read counts, the performance
of baySeq and NOISeq is slightly improved. However, the length
normalization does not really improve the overall performance
on genes with low read counts much or correct the selection bias.

3.5 Comparison with Cuffdiff 2

Different from gene-level methods that use raw read counts,
Cuffdiff 2 requires the mapping of reads to the given transcripts
of genes as input to call differential gene expression (Trapnell
et al., 2013). To assess the performance of Cuffdiff 2 on the
MAQC and Grifﬁth’s datasets, the RNA-Seq reads of the two

real datasets are mapped to the annotated transcriptome UCSC
hg19 using Tophat as done in (Trapnell et al., 2013). The same
threshold 0.1 for the FDR values is used to call DE genes for
Cufflink 2. The prediction accuracies of MRFSeq and Cuffdiff 2
on the two datasets are summarized in Supplementary Table S5,
with the LR threshold b: 2 and the cutoff P—Value 0.05 for the
MAQC and Grifﬁth’s datasets, respectively. The precision-sensi-
tivity curves also are illustrated in Supplementary Figure S3. The
table shows that MRFSeq has a signiﬁcantly better F-score (and
thus overall performance) by achieving a higher sensitivity, while
Cuffdiff 2 achieves a better precision. The precision-sensitivity
curve also suggests that MRFSeq has a better overall perform-
ance than Cuffdiff 2 when we consider the full spectrum of FDR
or restricting the FDR value to at most 0.1. A detailed analysis
shows that Cuffdiff 2 predicts fewer true DE genes with relatively
small LR values than MRFSeq. In the MAQC dataset, there are
290 true DE genes with the LR values from 0.5 to 2. The pre-
diction of MRFSeq covers 171 of the 290 genes, while Cuffdiff 2
can only detect 140 of the true DE genes. In Grifﬁth’s dataset, 9
true DE genes are associated with P—Values, which measure the
signiﬁcance of the difference between the LR values, from 0.005
to 0.001. All of the 9 true DE genes are predicted by MRFSeq,
but Cuffdiff 2 could only identify 4 of the DE genes. This result is
consistent with the discussion in (Trapnell et al., 2013). In gen-
eral, Cuffdiff 2 may report fewer DE genes with relatively low
LR rates because of its control of variance in expression owing to
fragment count uncertainty.

3.6 Consistency of predictions by DESeq and MRF Seq

A gene is deﬁned to be incorrectly inverted if its DE state is
correctly predicted by using RNA-Seq data alone but incorrectly
predicted by MRFSeq. Although our above results demonstrate
that using the prior knowledge of gene coexpression signiﬁcantly
improves the overall accuracy of differential gene expression ana-
lysis and helps to alleviate the bias against genes with low read
counts, it raises the question if the prior knowledge might intro-
duce some new prediction biases. In this subsection, we estimate
the number of incorrectly inverted genes in the prediction of
MRFSeq compared with prediction by a popular RNA-Seq
based method DESeq and analyze the types of genes in coex-
pression networks that are more likely to be incorrectly inverted.
The detailed prediction results of DESeq and MRFSeq on our
above simulation and real datasets are compared. In the 40 simu-
lation benchmark datasets, only 3092 of the 73 619 (4.2%)
correctly predicted genes by DESeq are incorrectly inverted by
MRFSeq. In the MAQC and Grifﬁth’s datasets, only 16 (3.5%)
and 0 (0%) genes correctly predicted by DESeq are incorrectly
inverted by MRFSeq, respectively. Generally, most of the cor-
rectly predicted genes by DESeq remain correct in the MRFSeq
prediction. Moreover, we observe that the incorrectly inverted
genes tend to have higher edge degrees in gene coexpression net-
works than the other genes. The comparison of the average edge
degree of all genes and that of the incorrectly inverted genes in
gene coexpression networks is shown in Supplementary Figure
S4. The signiﬁcance of the difference between the edge degrees is
conﬁrmed by using one-tailed t-test (Goulden, 1956). The
P—Value of the t-tests on the simulation and MAQC datasets
are 5.1 x 10’14 and 5.1 x 104, respectively. However, as gene

coexpression networks usually possess the well-known scale-free
property, only a small number of genes have high edge degrees
(Carlson et al., 2006; Stuart et al., 2003). This property should
limit the number of incorrectly inverted genes, and thus most
of the DE or EE genes correctly predicted based on RNA-seq
data alone (by, e. g. DESeq) are well preserved in the result of
MRFSeq.

4 CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

In this work, we have proposed a new statistical method,
MRFSeq, that combines both RNA-Seq data and coexpression
information and obtains a MAP estimation of the DE/EE genes
efﬁciently. The discussion of the improvement beneﬁts from
our graphical model is provided in Section 1.3 of the
Supplemmentary Materials. Using extensive experiments on
both simulated and real data, we have shown that MRFSeq is
able to take advantage of coexpression information and this add-
itional piece of information can help provide a more accurate
and less biased differential gene expression analysis. Clearly, our
improved performance (especially on genes with low read counts)
critically depends on the existence of a high-quality gene
coexpression network (See the discussion in Section 1.4 of
Supplementary Materials.) Finally, MRFSeq uses the DE ana-
lysis results of DESeq. It would be interesting to study how
MRFSeq performs when the DE analysis results of other tools
are used instead. Section 1.5 of Supplementary Materials com-
pares the performance of MRFSeq with the variant where
NOISeq is incorporated. We plan to make MRFSeq ﬂexible so
it can be combined with any DE analysis tool in the near future.

Our experiments used COXPREdb (Obayashi and Kinoshita,
2011), which consists of coexpression data for seven model or-
ganisms. One could also consider using other sources of coex-
pression data such as ACT (Manfield et al., 2006), ATTED-II
(Obayashi et al., 2007), CSB.DB (Steinhauser et al., 2004),
CoP(Ogata et al., 2010), etc. or constructing custom gene coex-
pression networks from publicly available expression data such
as GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), ENCODE (http://
encodeproject.org/ENCODE/), modENCODE (http://www.
modencode.org/), etc., especially for organisms (or tissues) not
covered by COXPREdb. Moreover, the threshold ,0 used for
extracting pairs of coexpressed genes from a given gene coexpres-
sion network may also have an impact on the performance of our
algorithm. We set ,0 = 0.5 empirically in our experiments based
on the literature (Patil et al., 2011; Watson, 2006) and some
preliminary tests on the MAQC data. Clearly, a higher ,0 may
decrease the sensitivity of MRFSeq, while a lower ,0 may de-
crease the precision of MRFSeq. We plan to explore the
impact of different coexpression networks (including the choice
of p) on the performance of MRFSeq and study automatic meth-
ods for choosing an optimal p in future work.

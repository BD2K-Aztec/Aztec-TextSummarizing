Abstract

Summary: The codon—equivalent multiple alignment suite begins conservational analysis for poly—
merase chain reaction primer design at the protein level, allowing the user to design consensus pri—
mers capable of detecting homologous coding sequences even when low—to—moderate sequence
information is available. This package also condenses the wealth of information associated with
multiple sequence alignments and presents them in an intuitive manner, allowing the user to
quickly and effectively address degenerate primer design considerations.

1 Introduction

In many polymerase chain reaction (PCR) applications, it is desir—
able to design PCR primers, which can amplify across similar tar—
geted DNA fragments. Some examples include genetic screening to
detect homologous genes across multiple organisms and working
with highly variable sequences, such as in viral strains. Primers can
be designed within a conserved region of the target sequences in
such a way that the annealing properties of the primers remain rela—
tively unchanged across multiple templates. Minor variations in the
sequences can be accounted for by introducing degenerate positions
into the primers. However, increasing the degeneracy of a primer
also increases the likelihood of stable sites outside of the target re—
gion, leading to an increased risk of byproduct formation.
Byproduct formation is undesirable in PCR as it can lead to false—
type results (by out—competing and/0r having similar product sizes
as the amplicon) and/or additional purification steps for down—
stream cloning applications.

In this work, we present CEMAsuite (https://s0urcef0rge.net/pro
jects/cemasuite/l, an open source Java—based application with the abil—
ity to (i) construct a codon—equivalent multiple alignment (CEMA)
from a protein multiple sequence alignment (MSA) file, (ii) generate
and score each consensus DNA sequence position using multiple

algorithms, (iii) design single—degeneracy primer backbones using
Primer3 (Untergasser et (11., 2012) and (iv) estimate the stability of de—
generate primers on each of the coding sequences (CDSs) within the
CEMA. The goal of CEMAsuite is to aid in the design of degenerate
primer sets which are robust enough for the assay at hand yet retain
as much specificity and product homology as possible.

2 Methods

Under the equiprobability assumption, the probability that all resi—
dues of an arbitrary column in an arbitrary MSA will match the first
residue in that column due to random chance alone can be described
by the equation: P: (R + 1)(1 T "), where R is the number of
observed residue states (+1 for deletion) and n is the number of se—
quences in the MSA. This type of conservation can be considered a
sort of Type I error where the conservation is present, but due to
random chance alone, and not necessarily from evolutionary pres—
sures. This conservation is undesirable in probe design since it has
no inﬂuencing factors to remain conserved, meaning the use of pri—
mers based on these regions on a homolog with unknown sequence
may result in a loss of primer annealing ability. For this reason,

CEMAsuite

CEMAsuite begins the conservational analysis for primer design on
the protein level, where R : 20, as opposed to coding DNA, where
R : 4. A CEMA is generated by obtaining the primary CDSs of pro—
teins in an extant MSA and expanding each position within the pro—
tein MSA to the observed codon representing each amino acid.

Since many primer design applications can account for positional
quality in their objective functions, each position within a consensus
sequence for a CEMA is scored by one of four algorithms. These al—
gorithms are detailed in the user manual. Brieﬂy, the Percent
Identity algorithm scores each position based on the normalized fre—
quency of the consensus nucleotide. Identity Runs scores positions
on identity, then adjusts the value based on the number of consecu—
tive completely conserved positions in the locale. Potential
Degeneracy scores positions on identity and then adjusts the value
based on the potential degeneracy of the consensus codon positions
according to one of 18 translation tables. The final algorithm, Runs
6‘ Degeneracy, scores values sequentially using logic from each of
the three methods described above.

The location of a primer within a CEMA is considered to be
the region with the least total number of mismatches throughout
all sequences. For cases where there are equal numbers of mis—
matches, the algorithm returns the index with mismatches occur—
ring mostly on the 5’—end. Simulated hybridization of the primers
to each template is performed by iterating through all possible
permutations of a degenerate primer and estimating its most stable
conformation when bound to the respective location of the tem—
plate. Each simulated hybridization event returns a Gibbs free en—
ergy value estimated using nearest neighbor thermodynamics
which is corrected using one of two entropic correction formulas
(detailed in user manual).

3Usage

A Java Swing—based interface is deployed containing tabs that allow
the user to visualize the step—wise primer design process. Before
using CEMAsuite, the user must first possess a MSA file of the

protein—of—interest. This file can be imported and will be displayed
under the Protein MSA tab.

Next, the user may choose to either upload the CDSs from a file
or attempt to retrieve them from the National Center for
Biotechnological Information database via the Entrez Efetch utility
(Geer et 41]., 2010). Once the sequences have been successfully up—
loaded, they will be displayed under the CDS tab.

Next, the CEMA can be generated and displayed under the
CEMA tab (Fig. 1, left). The user may select one of the four consen—
sus scoring methods described in Section 2. The strengths and weak—
nesses of each algorithm are described in further detail in the user
manual. At this point, the scored consensus sequence will be visible
as a bar plot underneath the tabs (Fig. 1, left).

Once a scored consensus sequence has been obtained, CEMAsuite
accesses a compiled Primer3 executable, which can return potential
primer sets for the consensus sequence displayed under the Primer
Design tab. Scored consensus information can also be readily exported
for input into alternate design applications if desired.

After the primers have been designed, each primer—template hy—
bridization combination can be calculated and displayed under the
Hybridization tab (Fig. 1, right). CEMAsuite will highlight pri—
mer—template pairs, which are unlikely to successfully amplify as
shown in Figure 1. Results from 94 PCR experiments were col—
lected from literature and subjected to the hybridization algorithm
to obtain the default warning threshold values; however, these val—
ues can be adjusted readily. Selective degeneracy can be added
by the user to increase the stability of the primer—template pairs
(Fig. 1, right), which can be viewed by reiterating the hybridiza—
tion algorithm.

4Condu§on

Because CEMAsuite begins conservational analysis at the protein
level, the primers obtained through this application will have a
high likelihood of successful amplification even when the template

sequence information is unknown (e.g. PCR amplification of a
novel environmental isolate). Additionally, because actual CDS
information is used and degeneracy can be added as needed,
users are free to balance the specificity and sensitivity of a PCR
primer set.

It is important to note that even though CEMAsuite incorporates
Primer3 functionality, the scoring algorithms and output graphics
significantly speed up the process of primer design by inspection for
those with moderate primer design experience.

We expect CEMAsuite to be a valuable assay design tool for ap—
plications such as genetic/environmental screening, working with
highly variable sequences and DNA quality control via PCR. An ac—
tive open source community dedicated to improving the degenerate
PCR primer design process is the goal of this project, and the partici—
pation of those whom are interested is encouraged. This application

ABSTRACT

Summary: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which
produce huge volumes of data, are now being carried out by many
groups around the world, creating a need for user-friendly tools for
data quality control (QC) and analysis. One critical aspect of GWAS
QC is evaluating genotype cluster plots to verify sensible genotype
calling in putatively associated single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs). Evoker is a tool for visualizing genotype cluster plots, and
provides a solution to the computational and storage problems
related to working with such large datasets.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have recently
transformed the landscape of complex human disease genetics
by identifying hundreds of genes affecting risk for common
diseases and traits (Hirschhom, 2009). While these studies have
become commonplace, the large volumes of data they produce still
pose analytical and computational challenges. Among the most
important of these is the importance of rigorous quality control
(QC) procedures (de Bakker et (11., 2008) which help to reduce
false positives arising from poor quality DNA, population structure,
hidden confounders and genotyping artifacts. This last category,
genotype calling artifacts, persist despite the considerable effort
which has been invested in genotype calling algorithms (Korn et (11.,
2008; Teo et (11., 2007; Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium,
2007) and automated QC ﬁlters. While ﬁlters like genotype call rate
and Hardy—Weinberg equilibrium can ﬂag a proportion of poorly
clustered SNPs, the most reliable means of verifying the quality of
genotypes is to visualize the genotype cluster plots for each SNP
individually (Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, 2007).
While genotype cluster visualization is critical to GWAS QC,
it remains challenging for many GWAS research groups to do
so efﬁciently. The normalized intensity ﬁles from which genotype
cluster plots are generated are extremely large and unwieldy in the
default formats from SNP chip providers (uncompressed text-format
intensities from a GWAS of 10000 individuals would be hundreds
of gigabytes). Extracting subsets of data and plotting hundreds of
SNPs of interest is typically a tedious procedure requiring some
computational sophistication. Moreover, the rapid proliferation of
GWAS has exposed a general need for freely available, easy-to-use

tools for routine tasks, as illustrated by the widespread adoption of
programs like PLINK (Purcell et (11., 2007) for QC and association
analyses. Therefore, we have developed Evoker, a Java program
which supports two simple and compact binary data formats and
is designed to make genotype cluster plot inspection an easy and
efﬁcient process.

2 FEATURES

2.1 Overview

While many groups have implemented ad hoc genotype cluster
plotting solutions (e.g. producing static images via the statistical
software package R), they suffer from a number of drawbacks. First,
because the source data ﬁles are enormous and cannot be stored
locally on users’ machines, the plots cannot easily be generated in
an interactive fashion. Second, no convenient interface exists for
standard GWAS tasks, such as rapidly scoring a large number of
SNPs. Finally, static images provide little ﬂexibility for exploring
the details of genotype calling, especially in borderline SNPs.
Evoker addresses these problems with remote data access via SSH,
a streamlined workﬂow, and additional interactive features.

2.2 File formats and data access

Evoker requires four data ﬁle types, which provide information
about samples, SNPs, genotype calls and X/Y allelic intensities.
These can be formatted either as PLINK (Purcell et (11., 2007) ‘binary
pedigree’ ﬁles or in a similar format used by the WTCCC2 project
(Consortium and WTCCC2, 2009). Both of these formats utilize
a binary format (rather than text) to reduce the size of the large
genotype and intensity ﬁles, while preserving rapid indexing to any
particular SNP. While these formats are substantially smaller than
source text ﬁles, they are still too large to be practically stored
on local workstations. Evoker can therefore connect to a remote
server via SSH with appropriately formatted data. When accessing
data remotely, Evoker only copies the relatively small sample and
SNP information ﬁles while very large genotype and intensity ﬁles
remain on the remote host. A helper perl script extracts genotype and
intensity data for speciﬁc SNPs when requested by the client, and
only this small slice of data is passed back via the SSH connection,
keeping the client responsive.

2.3 Streamlined workﬂow

Upon loading data, Evoker will automatically recognize and load
multiple sample sets present in the data directory (e.g. cases and
controls, samples from different collections or samples that have
undergone different experimental processes). This allows the user

to easily View multiple collections side by side to compare genotype
calls across sample sets. Plots for can be quickly saved in the PNG
graphic format for either individual collections or all displayed
collections.

Plots for particular markers can be quickly called up by searching
on the marker name, along with summary statistics on minor allele
frequency, genotyping call rate and Hardy—Weinberg equilibrium
P-value. A common application of the program is to View dozens or
hundreds of SNPs showing evidence for association to rule out false
positives caused by clustering artifacts. Although it is possible for
the user to view all the SNPs they wish to using the simple search
interface, the most efﬁcient way to accomplish this task is using a
SNP list. Users can load a simple text list of SNP IDs of interest
to be plotted one at a time. The user can quickly View, assess and
make a decision of yes, no or maybe for each SNP via buttons or
keyboard shortcuts. These decisions are recorded in a separate ﬁle
and the next SNP in the list is automatically displayed. Using SNP
lists while connected to a remote data source is fast and responsive,
because Evoker will download the data for all SNPs in the list in the
background.

2.4 Additional features

Unlike most available cluster plot visualizations, Evoker provides a
number of useﬁil interactive advantages. Hovering over a particular
point pops up a ‘tooltip’ with the corresponding sample ID (Fig. l).
Dragging a rectangle down and to the right zooms in on the
highlighted area of the plot, and dragging up and to the left zooms
back out. Finally, a history of the most recently viewed SNPs allows
the user to quickly switch between different plots.

Evoker can also be used to visualize the effect that excluding
certain samples (such as those on the borderline of particular QC

thresholds) has on the genotype clusters. Sets of samples can
be removed from cluster plots by loading simple text lists of
sample IDs. Once an exclusion list is loaded, the samples in the
list can be shown or hidden by toggling a checkbox. This feature
can be a useful diagnostic of whether particular individuals have a
consistent effect on the shape of genotype clusters, in which case
the entire dataset may need to be recalled after their exclusion.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

Evoker is written in Java and will work on any platform with Java 1 .5
or later installed. The Evoker bundle also includes a number of script
written in Perl which require an installation of Perl 5.005 or later. The
scripts included in the Evoker bundle enable users to easily create
the ﬁles Evoker requires, such as binary intensity ﬁles, from widely
used ﬁle formats such as CHIAMO (Wellcome Trust Case Control
Consortium, 2007), Illuminus (Teo et (11., 2007) and Birdsuite
(Korn et (11., 2008). Evoker is open source software under the MIT
license, hosted at http://sourceforge.net/projects/evoker/ (details for
downloading the source code are available on the web site).

4 CONCLUSION

Evoker is an open source program for visualizing genotype
cluster plots designed to be integrated into QC workﬂows for
GWAS. It provides a fast, user-friendly and interactive interface
to these large and cumbersome datasets, enabling researchers
without computational backgrounds to undertake this key QC step
consistently while reducing the amount of time spent on the task.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Integrative mathematical and statistical models of
cardiac anatomy and physiology can play a vital role in understanding
cardiac disease phenotype and planning therapeutic strategies.
However, the accuracy and predictive power of such models
is dependent upon the breadth and depth of noninvasive
imaging datasets. The Cardiac Atlas Project (CAP) has established
a large-scale database of cardiac imaging examinations and
associated clinical data in order to develop a shareable, web-
accessible, structural and functional atlas of the normal and
pathological heart for clinical, research and educational purposes.
A goal of CAP is to facilitate collaborative statistical analysis of
regional heart shape and wall motion and characterize cardiac
function among and within population groups.

Results: Three main open-source software components were
developed: (i) a database with web-interface; (ii) a modeling client
for 3D+time visualization and parametric description of shape and
motion; and (iii) open data formats for semantic characterization
of models and annotations. The database was implemented using
a three-tier architecture utilizing MySQL, JBoss and Dcm4chee,
in compliance with the DICOM standard to provide compatibility
with existing clinical networks and devices. Parts of Dcm4chee
were extended to access image specific attributes as search
parameters. To date, approximately 3000 de-identified cardiac
imaging examinations are available in the database. All software
components developed by the CAP are open source and are
freely available under the Mozilla Public License Version 1.1
(http://wwwmozil|a.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.txt).

1 INTRODUCTION

In both the clinical and research settings, a variety of techniques
can be used to quantify cardiac performance at various structural
and functional levels. Electrocardiography allows monitoring of
the electrical activity of the heart to diagnose pathology such
as rhythm disturbances, myocardial infarction and hypertrophy.
Blood pressure measurements enable detection of hypertension.
Cardiovascular imaging studies provide quantiﬁcation of cardiac
mass and volumes, as well as assessment of regional heart wall
motion. The ability to integrate these multi-source, multivariate data
has enormous implications for the diagnosis and clinical care of
patients (Kohane, 2009). Mathematical and computational models
can be used to integrate data in a standardized way, providing both
a ‘big picture’ population map of the various factors that determine
cardiac function as well as highly detailed information which can be
used to characterize function in an individual patient (patient speciﬁc
models). These models can elucidate the complex interaction of
electrical, anatomical and functional data to provide insight into
the processes underlying the normal or pathological function of
the heart. Furthermore, models derived from large populations of
patients can provide a range of reference values against which
individual patients’ data can be compared.

A number of biomedical initiatives use computational modeling
to integrate multi-scale anatomical, functional and clinical data
from diverse sources. These include the Physiome Project (Hunter
and Borg, 2003), the International Consortium for Brain Mapping
(Mazziotta et (11., 2001), Informatics for Integrating Biology and
the Bedside (i2b2) (Murphy et al., 2006) and the Cardiac Gene
Expression database (Bober et al., 2002) among others. These
projects depend on large population databases for the development
and validation of physiological models.

The Cardiac Atlas Project (CAP) is an international collaboration
to establish a large-scale standardized database of cardiac imaging
examinations and derived functional analyses. The aim is to develop
a computational, structural and functional atlas of the normal and
pathological heart. These atlases can be deﬁned as a set of maps

which relate scientiﬁc information to spatial coordinates at a series
of scales, from genotype to phenotype (Thompson et al., 2000; Toga
et al., 1996). The research objectives of CAP are to:

(1) Establish a database of cardiac imaging examinations
consisting of de-identiﬁed image ﬁles together with associated
clinical data.

(2) Develop open source software for the analysis of cardiac
morphology including (i) Visualization of images in 3D over
time, and (ii) interactive construction of mathematical cardiac
models from the images.

(3) Develop standardized protocols for the contribution, curation,
archival, classiﬁcation and sharing of cardiac image data and
derived analyses, including labeling of images and models in
the CAP database with ontological terms.

Here, we describe the design of the computational and informatics
infrastructure together with procedures for contribution of data
to the CAP, de—identiﬁcation, standardization and sharing of data
and software tools, and policies for the protection of the rights of
participants, contributors and users of the database. The article is
organized as follows: Section 2 outlines the requirements, design and
implementation of CAP components, accompanied by an overview
of the issues underlying regulatory requirements and stake-holder
rights. Section 3 gives details of the major contributing studies, the
results of the validation procedures performed, current database and
client ﬁinctionality, XML schema and policies regarding access to
the database.

2 METHODS

2.1 Stake-holders

The CAP is an international collaboration funded by the National Institutes
of Health, USA. The host institutions are the University of Auckland (New
Zealand) and the University of California Los Angeles (USA) with databases
maintained and mirrored in both institutions. Where possible, infrastructure
for data sharing has been adapted and re-used from the UCLA Center for
Computational Biology and Laboratory of Neurological Imaging (LONI),
which has considerable experience in the area of computational brain
atlases (Mazziotta et al., 2001). Stake-holders in CAP include the following
parties:

(1) Participants: people who have participated in a research study
contributing data to CAP, or have otherwise provided informed
consent to contribute data to CAP.

(2) Contributors: research study investigators who originally acquired the
data and shared it by contributing it to CAP. Decisions regarding data
use are typically made by the contributing study steering committee.

(3) Users: third party researchers who access CAP data in order to
undertake research into cardiovascular function and disease.

Cardiac imaging examinations and associated clinical data are contributed
from a number of sources, including research studies, clinical trials and
clinical centers.

2.2 Imaging and clinical data

Cardiovascular imaging provides an abundant source of detailed, quantitative
data on heart structure and function. Common investigations include
ultrasound, computed tomography, radionuclide imaging and MRI. Many
research studies have employed MRI because it is noninvasive, well tolerated
and safe (no ionizing radiation), has the ability to modulate contrast, and

can provide high-quality functional information in any plane and direction
(Fig. 1).

The tomographic nature of MRI data lends itself to 3D atlas building
techniques and to date, all CAP imaging data has come from MRI.
These studies typically consist of @12 cine acquisitions in the short axis
orientation, with 20750 frames through the cardiac cycle and 172mm
pixel resolution. Imaging protocols include gradient recalled echo (GRE)
(Boxerman et al., 1998) and steady state free precession (SSFP) (Thiele et al.,
2001) techniques. Studies have also contributed core laboratory analyses of
the image data, in the form of annotations and contouring (Fig. 1) of the
left ventricular boundaries at end-diastole (end of ﬁlling) and end-systole
(end of ejection), and de-identiﬁed text data containing the clinical status
and demographics of the participants.

2.3 Regulatory compliance

Since CAP is an international, multi-institutional collaborative project, it
must comply with a variety of legislative and local Institutional Review
Board (IRB) requirements. Local Ethics Committee and [RB approvals were
obtained for CAP at the two host institutions. In addition, CAP policy requires
that all data must be obtained and contributed with the approval of a local
[RB or Ethics Committee, and informed consent for data sharing must be
obtained from each participant.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
Privacy and Security Rules (45 CFR Parts 160, 162 and 164, available
at http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/privacyrule/index.html)
regulate the use and disclosure of research participant’s protected health
information (PHI) in the USA. PHI are any data that could be used to identify
an individual, e.g. names, dates (except for year), social security or medical
record numbers, locations or other unique identiﬁers. To protect the identity
of participants, PHI must be replaced or removed before data can be shared,
a process known as de-identiﬁcation. Use of de—identiﬁed data is considered
by many IRBs not to constitute human subjects research.

2.4 Data de-identiﬁcation

In CAP, all data must be de-identiﬁed by the contributors before upload into
the database. The de-identiﬁcation process removes PHI from both text and
image data, and replaces subject identiﬁers such as the name of the individual,
or the original study code, with an unrelated CAP code. Medical images
contributed to CAP are stored as DICOM Objects (DICOM-P535. 2009).
These objects contain data attributes including information on the scanner,
the imaging protocol and the scanned object. The current DICOM standard
(V2009) contains more than 2800 public DICOM attributes. In addition, many
DICOM and PACS manufacturers include proprietary information within
private DICOM attributes.

We adapted the LONI Debabeler (Neu et al., 2005), a HIPAA compliant
software tool, for the de-identiﬁcation of DICOM images. We created a CAP-
speciﬁc Debabeler with rules to encrypt or replace DICOM attributes that
could potentially contain PHI, while retaining essential information on the
image acquisition.

The output of the CAP Debabeler includes the key linking CAP codes
to the original identiﬁers, which is then kept by the contributor. CAP
personnel, and third party CAP users, do not have access to this key. The
Debabeler rules are available from the CAP project site at SourceForge.net
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/cardiacatlas/).

2.5 Database design

Software was designed to enable storage and retrieval of medical image and
text data, ontological annotations and volumetric shape models (Fig. 2).
Browsing, searching, image preview and download functionality are
included.

The database was developed using a three-tier architecture (web-,
application- and database server) including monitoring and secure
authentication with access privileges based on user need. Due to its
mature architecture and code base, active development, maintenance and
support, DICOM compliance, compatibility with other Java APIs and other
international research projects such as the Cancer Biomedical Informatics
Grid (Cimino et al., 2009) and the Cardiovascular Research Grid (CVRG;
http://www.cvrgrid.org), we based the database on the open source image
archive Dcm4chee, and extended its functionality. Dcm4chee is a clinical

data manager system based on a J2EE (Alur et al., 2003) and JMX (Fleury
and Lindfors. 2002) software architecture and is deployed within the JBoss
Application Server. It provides a number of useful clinical interfaces,
including:

(1) Ability to store, query, and retrieve any type of DICOM object;

(2) WADO (Web Access to DICOM Objects) and RID (IHE Retrieve
Information for Display) interfaces to allow access from the web;

(3) a robust user interface which runs entirely in a web browser; and

(4) Audit Record RepositoryilHE ATNA audit logging (Gregg et al.,
2006).

The Dcm4chee application logic, database schema and web-application
were extended to provide access to MRI speciﬁc attributes as deﬁned in
the DICOM Standard MR Image Module (DICOM-P533, 2009). These
included vendor and model of the scanner used to acquire the images. The
database ﬁelds are populated at image import using extended methods from
the Dcm4chee Enterprise Java Beans (EJ B s).

The web-application extension allows all added attributes to be used as
search options. Aresearcher might be interested in speciﬁc studies, cine series
or individual images that satisfy speciﬁc search parameters. For this purpose,
a search ﬁlter was added to generate result listings grouped by Patient, Study,
Series or Image. To allow searching for arbitrary DICOM attributes, an XPath
query (details of XPath are described at http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath20/)
was implemented. An XML tree (Bray et al., 2006) representing the DICOM
structure of the imported images is generated, stripped of binary and large
values, and stored in the database.

The download functionality of the Dcm4chee web-application was
extended to allow the download of complete DICOM studies, series
and volumetric models including referenced data. This is achieved by
implementing a seeret that collects the requested data from the server and
provides it as a compressed archive to the user (Smart et al., 2005).

2.6 Parametric modeling of cardiac function

Atlas-based methods are well established for the statistical classiﬁcation and
quantiﬁcation of shape and wall motion characteristics of the heart (Young
and Frangi. 2009). These methods enable standardized analysis of statistical
variations present within and among patient groups, and enable classiﬁcation
of individual phenotypes within known population distributions. In almost
all cases contributed to the CAP, contours were contributed in association
with the images and clinical information. These contours can be used as
the input to a standardized model-based analysis to establish shape and
motion with respect to a standard coordinate system, similar to the Talairach
coordinate system used in the brain (Mega 2005; Tang, Hojatkashani et al.
2010). Since shape and motion are mathematically mapped, statistical tools
such as principal component analysis can be used to quantify the signiﬁcant
modes of variation present within a population. In CAP, the parametric
shape descriptors lend themselves to ﬁnite element modeling, which can
then enable biophysical simulation of physiological processes, including
nonlinear mechanical properties and large deformations of the heart, and
solve the biophysical conservation laws linking stress, strain and energy
expenditure.

By customizing mathematical models of the anatomy and function of
the heart to individual cases, it is possible to construct parameter variation
models describing the distribution of regional cardiac shape and function
across patient subgroups. Homologous landmarks (i.e. the points that are
aligned to match corresponding features in the shape) can be used to
characterize shape and shape variations with the aid of a principal component
analysis, or similar technique. Since mathematical models, represented by
the model parameters, are a complete and efﬁcient characterization of cardiac
shape and motion, a statistical analysis of the variation inherent in the
parametric shape and motion models can be formed (Young and Frangi.
2009).

2.7 CAP client design

An open-source client side software tool was developed for the visualization
and analysis of the cardiac MRI images available in the database. The
software allows visualization of the data in 3D + time and interactive ﬁtting
of a ﬁnite-element volumetric model to any given dataset.

The CAP client has been designed with the following objectives in mind.

0 Performance: to allow the user to view and manipulate large
image datasets in 3D and ﬁt models to them in an interactive
manner. In order to meet the real-time 3D graphics and
numerical computation requirements, the C++ programming
language was chosen for its superior time efﬁciency and the
availability of high-performance numerical libraries. The CAP
client uses hardware-accelerated OpenGL API for graphics
rendering and the GMM++ linear algebra library (available at
http://download.gna.org/getfem/html/homepage/gmm/index.html) for
model ﬁtting.

0 Ease of use: the CAP client is expected to be used by nontechnical
users for educational and research purposes, therefore ease of use was
an important design goal. All features of the software are accessible
through an intuitive graphical user interface.

0 Extensibility and maintainability: in order to encourage external
developers to extend the CAP client to suit their needs, the source code
is structured to accommodate such extensions. Various object-oriented
techniques were adopted to increase the extensibility of the software.
For example, the abstract factory design pattern and the adaptor design
pattern (Gamma et al., 1995) were used to ease the possible replacement
of the linear algebra library.

0 Portability: the CAP client was designed to be portable across
different platforms and currently runs on Microsoft Windows, Mac
OS X and Linux. This portability is achieved using cross-platform
libraries such as wxWidgets (Smart et al., 2005), boost (available at
http://www.boost.org) and GMM++, as well as build and testing tools
such as CMake and Google Test.

The CAP client was built on the open source Cmgui library (available
at http://www.cmiss.org/cmgui), an advanced visualization software library
developed at the Auckland Bioengineering Institute for visualization and
manipulation of general ﬁnite element models. This visualization library
was employed because it has a large suite of tools available for parametric
shape modeling of the heart, and is readily customizable for CAP purposes.

2.8 Semantic data model

The CAP database contains more than 1.5 million MRI images from
symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. To facilitate automated ﬁtting
of volumetric models and searching for speciﬁc characteristics, CAP is
labeling images using a controlled vocabulary. SNOMED-CT (Ryan et al.,
2007) and the Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA) (Rosse and Mejino,
2003) are established ontologies providing clinical and anatomical concepts.
RadLex (Kundu et al., 2009) uniﬁes and supplements these standards and
provides a single source of radiology terms. From these resources, CAP has
selected cardiac and MRI terms for classiﬁcation of images and annotation
of anatomical landmarks. Where appropriate, we have provided feedback to
the resources to improve the terminology for cardiac labeling.

2.9 Policy and rights

To ensure that all data provided to CAP are managed according to well-
deﬁned principles, and in accordance with the regulatory and ethical
requirements associated with de-identiﬁed human image and clinical data,
policies and procedures related to data access, control and sharing have been
developed. These policies apply to (i) participants from whom the data was
obtained, (ii) contributors who originally collected and have contributed the
data, (iii) the CAP investigators and, (iv) third-party users who wish to access

CAP data. CAP contributors have made substantial monetary, intellectual and
time investments for the collection of the data in a well-controlled manner
(viz. original study design, recruitment, quality control, analysis, etc.), which
represents a valuable scientiﬁc resource. The conditions under which data are
originally acquired may vary substantially among contributors, for example
ranging from public good government funded studies to privately funded
trials with a commercially sensitive outcome. The terms and conditions
under which data can be shared consequently vary substantially among
contributors. CAP has therefore adopted a ‘bundle of rights” approach (see
www.cardiacatlas.org for further discussion) reﬂecting the goal of providing
access as openly and widely as possible, consistent with contributor and
participant consent. Data can be contributed as public domain provided the
informed consent is compatible with open unrestricted access. It should be
noted that an explicit objective of CAP is to provide a ﬂexible mechanism by
which data that would otherwise be inaccessible (for example, data generated
by privately funded clinical trials or ongoing longitudinal studies) can now
be accessed by researchers for a variety of diverse investigations. CAP has
successfully achieved this aim by developing policies that not only protect the
original data contributors (sponsors and investigators of privately funded or
ongoing studies), but also allow third party investigators an avenue of access
that would not be possible via other means. By negotiating and working
through these policies with the original investigators, CAP has paved the
way for future third-party access to the data.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Database

Two main studies comprise the current CAP database. The Multi
Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA; Bild et al., 2002) has
contributed 2864 asymptomatic volunteers to date. MESA is
investigating subclinical cardiovascular disease and the progression
to clinically overt disease in a diverse, population-based sample of
asymptomatic men and women aged 45—84 years. Participants with
no history of cardiovascular disease were recruited from six ﬁeld
centers across the United States. Approximately 38% of the study’s
participants were white, 28% African-American, 22% Hispanic and
12% Asian, predominantly of Chinese descent.

The Deﬁbrillators to Reduce Risk by Magnetic Resonance
Imaging Evaluation (DETERMINE) trial (Kadish et al., 2009) has
contributed 470 datasets from patients with myocardial infarction
to date. New studies are being contributed on an ongoing basis.
DETERMINE is a multicenter, randomized, clinical trial in patients
with coronary artery disease (CAD) and mild-to-moderate LV
dysfunction. The trial investigated whether patients with an infarct
size greater than or equal to 10% of left ventricular mass,
randomized to receive an implantable deﬁbrillator plus appropriate
medical therapy will have improved survival compared with patients
randomized to medical therapy alone.

In MESA, MRI data were acquired on Siemens and GE 1.5T
MRI scanners only. The images included cine (using the GRE pulse
sequence) in short-axis planes covering from the base of the heart
to the apex and in three long-axis planes. Images were analyzed
using MASS 4.0 (Medis, The Netherlands) by the MESA MRI core
laboratory at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and
ventricular contours contributed to CAP. In the DETERMINE trial,
MRI data were acquired on any of Siemens, GE and Philips 1.5T
or 3.0T MRI scanners. The imaging protocol included cine images
(using the SSFP pulse sequence) acquired in short-axis planes from
the base of the heart to the apex and in three long-axis planes, as
well as delayed enhancement viability (Kim et al., 1999) used for

detection and quantiﬁcation of myocardial infarction, acquired in
the same planes as the cine images. Images were analyzed using
QMASS MR 7.2 (Medis, The Netherlands) by the DETERMINE
MRI core laboratory at Northwestern University Feinberg School
of Medicine, and contours contributed to CAP.

Both studies also contributed limited clinical information
including: age (years), gender (M/F), height (cm), weight (kg),
systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mmHg), hypertension (Y/N),
heart rate (bpm), race/ethnicity and classiﬁcations for hypertension,
diabetes, smoking (Y/N), alcohol (Y/N), angina (Y/N), ECG and
NYHA classiﬁcation.

DETERMINE included an IRB approved speciﬁc section in the
participant information and consent forms to contribute de-identiﬁed
data to CAP. Participants could choose to give or withhold this
consent independent of their participation in DETERMINE. MESA
included an IRB approved informed consent process compatible
with data sharing and ﬁirther IRB approval was obtained for the
contribution of de-identiﬁed data to CAP.

CAP has been endorsed by the Society for Cardiovascular
Magnetic Resonance (www.scmr.org). Clinical cases with
appropriate informed consent can also be de-identiﬁed and made
publicly available in the database.

3.2 CAP client

Given a set of cardiac MRI images from the CAP database, the CAP
client software, (see Fig. 3) can be used for:

0 Visualization of MRI images, the mathematical model
constructed from the images, and animation of the motion
through time in the cardiac cycle.

0 Customization of a ﬁnite element model of the left ventricle
to the MRI images using guide point modeling (Young, 2000).
This process requires minimal human intervention, and results
in a mathematical model of the heart shape and motion in 3D
and time. The Client software also provides a means for users to
interactively and graphically modify model parameters derived

from other sources, such as semi-automatic ventricular analysis
methods.

Customized model parameters, along with images and contour
information, are stored in an XML ﬁle format as described in
Section 3.4.

3.3 Data analysis

To demonstrate the utility of the database for the statistical
characterization of heart shape and motion, the major modes of
variation within a subset of the DETERMINE cohort were calculated
using a principal component analysis. The ﬁrst three modes
associated with the greatest variation were found to correspond with
size, sphericity and mitral valve geometry (Fig. 4). These results
are encouraging since each of these modes are known measures
of adverse geometric remodeling following myocardial infarction.
Projection of an individual’s shape and motion onto these modes
(e.g. sphericity) provides a standardized method for quantifying the
amount of each mode present.

3.4 Semantic data model

To store volumetric models (Fig. 5) and supplementary data
for images such as contours and cardiac annotations using
ontological concepts, we have designed a standardized data
structure using XML. Storing data in an XML format allows
for simple conversions using the Extensible Stylesheet Language
Transformations (XSLT; described at http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt)
of (i) geometrical data into other languages such as FieldML
(Christie et al., 2009), and (ii) cardiac annotations into
knowledge representation languages, e.g. OWL (Web Ontology
Language), http://www.w3 .org/TR/owl-features/, or RDF (Resource
Description Framework), http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/rdf.
The XML ﬁles are stored using the XML database eXist (Meier,
2003), which provides core database features, such as indexing and
transaction recovery, enabling fast search and retrieval of model-
related data. Import and export of XML data has been implemented
by extending the Dcm4chee architecture (see Fig. 6). The extended
architecture provides a vehicle to store and retrieve image, model
and derived data.

3.5 Policy and rights

Standard operating procedures were developed to manage the
logistics of data sharing, including data requests and data transfer,
and to maintain the rights of the stake-holders.

Participants must give informed consent compatible with data
sharing to contribute their de-identiﬁed image and text data for
cardiovascular research now and in the future. All data must be

de-identiﬁed in a manner compatible with the HIPAA privacy rule,
using the CAP de-identiﬁcation process, and must occur at the
Contributor’s site before upload to the CAP data servers. CAP must

not receive or retain the original identiﬁers. CAP investigators, and
Users, must agree not to attempt to identify participants.

The key linking CAP codes with original identiﬁers must be
retained by the Contributor, so that investigators of the Contributing
Study can link results from CAP back to the original study if desired.
Participants can request withdrawal of their data from the database
at any time by requesting removal either via the CAP or directly
to the Contributor. In this case the Contributor must notify CAP of
which CAP data must be deleted.

Access to the data is unrestricted and open for those cases
with informed consent compatible with unrestricted access. In
many cases, however, the participant consent requires that access
is approved by the contributor. The Contributor or Contributing
Study Steering Committee then controls all data access through
data distribution agreements, on a request basis. Users are required
to submit a brief Research Proposal, outlining the rationale and
goals of the project, timeline and data storage, to the CAP Steering
Committee which includes CAP investigators from both of the
partner institutions, The University of Auckland and the University
of California Los Angeles, the NIH Program Ofﬁcer for CAP, and
investigator-representatives from each of the contributing studies.
The purpose of the review is primarily to protect the rights of
participants and contributors. If the proposal is within the remit
of CAP, CAP will liaise with each of the Contributors whose
data has been requested. Each Contributor (or nominee) must then

review the proposal and, if approved, provide a Data Distribution
(DDA) agreement. The User must then sign and abide by the
DDAs for each Contributor. Separate DDA’s are required for each
Contributor because terms and conditions governing data use may
differ depending on the circumstances under which the data were
acquired. The DDA deﬁnes all the terms and conditions governing
the use of the data, including publication policy, acknowledgements,
data handling, and intellectual property.

3.6 CAP software license

All software is freely available via the CAP website, to researchers
and educators in the nonproﬁt sector, such as educational
institutions, research institutes and government laboratories.
Instructions for accessing CAP source code are available at
http://www.cardiacatlas.org/web/guest/tools. Developer access to
CAP source projects is made available through a sourceforge
Mecurial repository. CAP database and heart modeling tools,
comprising database management, uploading and downloading
of images, web browser interface, conversion of data formats,
visualization and parametric modeling of shape and motion, are
being made available using the Mozilla Public License Version 1.1.
Dependent software such as Dcm4chee and Cmgui are compatible
with this license. Commercialization of enhanced or customized
versions of the software, or incorporation of the software or pieces
of it into other software packages, is permitted subject to third party
intellectual property claims. Researchers are permitted to modify
the source code and are strongly encouraged to share modiﬁcations
with other researchers as well as with CAP.

3.7 Use cases

CAP data may be used for a variety of purposes. Some use cases are
described below:

0 Image analysis: a subset of the data is being provided for a
left ventricular segmentation challenge at the Medical Image
Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI)
2011 conference. This challenge enables researchers to
test their automated segmentation algorithms on the same
large cardiac MRI dataset. thereby facilitating comparative
discussion as well as collaboration among peers on
combining the results to ﬁnd a better ground truth
(http://cilab2.upf.edu/stacom_cesc11/index.php).

0 Clinical evaluation: CAP data will be used to create a statistical
atlas for clinical purposes. This would be used to determine
whether a particular patient ﬁts within the normal range or
how many standard deviations the patient is from normal
values. Pathological processes such as LV remodeling will
be examined by comparison to pathology-matched statistically
predicted parameters, based on an individual’s known clinical
characteristics and the CAP population subgroup he or she
matches most closely.

0 Clinical trials: CAP data will be used to test hypotheses
comparing cohorts among studies in the database, or to
perform metadata queries on several studies, utilizing mapping
transforms to reduce bias due to study protocol.

0 Education: CAP data could also play an important role in
biomedical education programs. The collection of a well-
curated and diverse population of cardiac data is an excellent

platform from which to understand normal structure and
ﬁinction as well as to examine the statistical differences related
to age, gender, height, weight and pathology. The value of the
data is enhanced by the downloadable CAP Client software
for visualization in 3D and over time. Students could use the
software to ﬁt mathematical models to data, and then use the
models to better understand the effects of pathology on standard
clinical measurements such as ejection fraction, volumes and
wall thickening parameters.

4 FUTURE WORK

In accordance with the goals of standardized classiﬁcation and
sharing of data and resources, CAP is developing and building
upon currently available ontological schema to describe cardiac
image data and derived annotations and models, with plans to
federate these cardiovascular modeling software and data via the
CVRG (www.cvrgrid.org). A SPARQL (http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf—
sparql-query/) interface may be built when there is a substantial
amount of annotated data for this purpose, which requires semantic
annotations in our XML format, conversion to RDF or OWL, and
implementation of a semantic storage.

The parametric modeling tools and associated ontological schema
that are being developed by CAP will be expanded to facilitate data
fusion between different imaging protocols and modalities as well as
other data sources. Tools necessary for the statistical analysis of CAP
data are also being developed and will be used for the generation of
parametric distribution models.

5 CONCLUSIONS

The CAP currently hosts approximately 3000 cardiac MRI studies,
derived functional analyses and associated participant data that
represents a substantial and valuable resource. Tools for the de-
identiﬁcation of data were developed, validated and successfully
deployed by the contributing studies. The necessary IRB and Ethics
Committee approvals were obtained and policies were developed to
protect the rights of subject participants, contributors and users of the
database. Applications to use the data can now be submitted to the
CAP website. Upon completion of a Data Distribution Agreement,
users can browse and query the database as well as View the images,
and download the data. The CAP database is compliant to the
DICOM standard and provides sophisticated image attribute search
options. The CAP Client software, downloadable at the Project’s
website, allows the user to import images from the database and
customize a ﬁnite element model to the image data. Volumetric
shape models are stored in XML and are available to the research
community via the CAP database. CAP procedures and tools are
designed to facilitate a workﬂow from the acquisition of CMR
images toward a statistical analysis of volumetric models.

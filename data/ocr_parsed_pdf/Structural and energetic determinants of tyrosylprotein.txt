ABSTRACT

Motivation: Tyrosine sulfation is a type of post-translational modifica-
tion (PTM) catalyzed by tyrosylprotein sulfotransferases (T PST).
The modification plays a crucial role in mediating protein—protein
interactions in many biologically important processes. There is no
well-defined sequence motif for TPST sulfation, and the underlying
determinants of TPST sulfation speciﬁcity remains elusive. Here, we
perform molecular modeling to uncover the structural and energetic
determinants of TPST sulfation specificity.

Results: We estimate the binding affinities between TPST and
peptides around tyrosines of both sulfated and non-sulfated proteins
to differentiate them. We find that better differentiation is achieved
after including energy costs associated with local unfolding of the
tyrosine-containing peptide in a host protein, which depends on
both the peptide’s secondary structures and solvent accessibility.
Local unfolding renders buried peptide—with ordered structures—
thermodynamically available for TPST binding. Our results suggest
that both thermodynamic availability of the peptide and its binding
affinity to the enzyme are important for TPST sulfation specificity,
and their interplay results into great variations in sequences and
structures of sulfated peptides. We expect our method to be useful
in predicting potential sulfation sites and transferable to other TPST
variants. Our study may also shed light on other PTM systems without
well-defined sequence and structural specificities.

1 INTRODUCTION

After their synthesis in the ribosome, many proteins undergo
post-translational modiﬁcations (PTM) such as glycosylation,
phosphorylation and peptide hydrolysis before reaching their
fully functional forms. Tyrosine sulfation is a common PTM
occurring on many proteins that transit through the Golgi
apparatus, such as extracellular matrix proteins, serine protease
inhibitors and G—protein coupled receptors (Stone et al., 2009).
So far hundreds of tyrosine-sulfated proteins have been identi-
ﬁed, and more are likely to be discovered. A list of sulfated

proteins can be obtained from the UniProt database (Bairoch
et al., 2005). A major functional role of tyrosine sulfation is to
mediate proteiniprotein interactions (Kehoe and Bertozzi, 2000).
Sulfation is Vital for many biological functions as indicated in
studies showing that postnatal Viability, Vision, fertility and
growth are affected in mice in the absence of sulfation
(Ouyang et al., 2002; Borghei et al., 2006). The functioning of
many proteins, including P—selectin glycoprotein ligand-1
(Pouyani and Seed, 1995; Wilkins et al., 1995), chemokine recep-
tors (Simpson et al., 2009), platelet glycoprotein Ib (Uff et al.,
2002; Zarpellon et al., 2011), depends on tyrosine sulfation. For
example, the sulfation of tyrosine in the chemokine receptor
CCRS is necessary for HIV-1 gp120 mediated entry of HIV
into CD4+ T-lymphocytes (Choe et al., 2003). A detailed under-
standing of the molecular mechanism of tyrosine sulfation is
therefore important for manipulating such modiﬁcations, regu-
lating cell signaling and drug development.

Sulfation is catalyzed by the tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase
(TPST) enzymes, which reside inside the Golgi apparatus.
The process involves the transfer of a sulfo-group from a
bound 3/-phosphoadenosine-5/-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to the
phenol group of tyrosine. In humans, two isoforms, TPST-1
and TPST-2, are found with 64% sequence identity between
them (Teramoto et al., 2013). The functional differences between
the isoforms or the necessity of two such isoforms are not
well-established. Sulfation occurs only on speciﬁc tyrosines in
proteins. Even though up to 1% of tyrosines in a cell’s proteome
can be sulfated (énnerfjord et al., 2004), the location of sulfated
tyrosines are not known for many proteins. Hence, neither the
exact role of sulfated tyrosines in these proteins nor the mechan-
ism by which the tyrosines are selected for sulfation is fully
understood. Analysis of the amino acid sequences ﬂanking
sulfated tyrosines suggested some general features such as the
presence of acidic and small residues, absence of disulﬁde
bonds or glycosylated residues and a reduced number of hydro-
phobic residues in the Vicinity of sulfated tyrosines (Rosenquist
and Nicholas, 1993). However, there are also many exceptions
to these general characteristics of sequence speciﬁcity. For
example, mutational studies reported an enhanced sulfation
efﬁciency when tyrosines were ﬂanked by basic residues
(Bundgaard et al., 1997). Therefore, in contrast to other PTMs
such as N—glycosylation, which recognizes structurally available
NX(T/S) triplets (Marshall, 1974), a well-defined sequence spe-
ciﬁcity for tyrosine sulfation cannot be established.

Owing to the lack of obvious sequence patterns, sophisticated
statistical tools have been developed to predict potential

Determinants of TPST sulfation specificity

 

locations of sulfation sites in a given protein. Sulﬁnator
(Monigatti et £11., 2002) constructed four different hidden
Markov models to recognize sulfated tyrosine residues depending
on their locations in the sequence: near N-terrninal, near
C-terrninal, in the center of a window of at least 25 amino
acids and in windows containing multiple tyrosines. In
PredSulSite (Huang et £11., 2012), physicochemical properties of
amino acids along with predicted secondary structures and
amino acid sequence order are considered in a supported
vector machine (SVM). The SVM algorithm has also been
applied in another predictor based on predicted secondary struc-
tures and solvent accessible surface area (Chang et £11., 2009).
These statistics-based tools work satisfactorily in their test
cases and have been useful in experimental studies of protein
sulfation (Goff et £11., 2003; Keykhosravani et £11., 2005).
However, these training-based statistical methods depend heavily
on the quality of the training set, such as the coverage and com-
pleteness, which is not the case for the increasing list of sulfated
proteins identiﬁed experimentally. As a result, many exceptions
were observed in cases beyond the training sets (Monigatti et £11.,
2006; énnerfjord et £11., 2004), and these methods are also not
transferable to other TPST variants, such as recently discovered
bacterial TPSTs (Han et £11., 2012). Most importantly, many of
these methods are sequence-based and the constructed predictors
lack structural or physicochemical insights to the molecular
mechanism of tyrosine selection by TPST enzyme.

Recently, a high-resolution structure of human TPST-2
(Fig. 1A) has been solved at 1.9A resolution in complex with a
high-afﬁnity peptide using X-ray crystallography (Teramoto
et £11., 2013), making it possible to study the structural and ener-
getic determinants of TPST sulfation speciﬁcity. In this work, we
adapt Eris 01in et £11., 2007a), a method developed to compute
protein stability changes on mutations, to estimate the binding
afﬁnities between TPST-2 and various peptide substrates to dif-
ferentiate sulfated and non-sulfated sequences that have been
experimentally veriﬁed. We ﬁnd that the peptide—TPST binding
afﬁnities cannot separate the sulfated and non-sulfated sequences
satisfactorily. Better differentiation is achieved after including
energy costs associated with local unfolding of the tyrosine-
containing peptides in the host protein, which depends on both
the peptide’s secondary structures and solvent accessibility. The
thermodynamic population of the locally unfolded peptides
determines the availability of the peptide for TPST binding
and subsequent catalysis. Therefore, our study suggests that
both the thermodynamics accessibility of a peptide and its
binding afﬁnity to TPST are important for sulfation. The
interplay of these two factors allows a great variety in sequences
and structures of sulfated peptides, where a buried peptide with
well-deﬁned secondary structure might be sulfated if the peptide
undergoes local unfolding, making itself available for enzyme
binding.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 Electrostatic analysis

To determine how the electrostatic interactions guide the peptides to the
protein, the electrostatic potential and force surrounding the protein were
calculated using Delphi OJ et £11., 2012) after removing the peptide from

et £11., 2013) with bound substrate peptide (yellow) and PAPS analog.
(B) Electrostatic potential and (C) ﬁeld lines of the enzyme after removing
the substrate peptide. The binding pocket has a high positive electrostatic
potential, and hence, the peptides with net negative charge can be driven
into the pocket by electrostatic interactions

the binding site. The following parameters were used for the calculation:
scale = 2.0 grids/A; grid size 280 x 280 x 280; and dielectric constants of
2.0 and 80.0 for protein and water environment, respectively. The force
ﬁeld used for the calculations was AMBER (Lindorff—Larsen et £11., 2010).
VMD graphics tool (Humphrey et £11., 1996) was used to visualize the
electrostatic surface and ﬁeld lines.

2.2 Protein—peptide binding afﬁnity
The relative binding afﬁnity of a given peptide with respect to the refer-
ence peptide can be quantiﬁed as
AAGb' d: (Geomplex _ Gprot _ Gpep) _ (Geomplex _ Gprot _ Gpep)
m t

mu 79/

where the superscript complex denotes the enzyme—peptide complex; prot
and pep refer to the protein and peptide in their unbound states, respect-
ively; the subscript mut denotes mutations of a given peptide with respect
to the reference peptide indicated by the subscript ref. Because the abso-
lute free energy is difﬁcult to measure, the free energy difference between
the folded and unfolded states, i.e. the stability AG, is most commonly
used. The unfolded state of the complex corresponds to the unfolded
protein and peptide, and thus AAGbind = (AG‘ompIeX— AG”"”—
AGpep)mu,—(AG“”"”I”— AG”"”— AGpep),ef. Because the protein sequence
is not changing,

AAGbW = AAGC‘W’“ — more (1)

where AAGcompl” and AAGPe” refer to the mutation-induced stability
changes for the complex and peptide, respectively.

2.3 Estimation of stability change on mutations

We used Eris to estimate the stability changes on mutations (Yin et £11.,
2007a). Eris uses the backbone-dependent rotamer library to model
protein side-chain conformations (Dunbrack and Cohen, 1997). Given
the vast side-chain rotameric space, the optimal packing was searched via
a Monte Carlo-based simulated annealing algorithm, where the rotameric
space of side chains was sampled according to the Metropolis criteria and
the simulation temperature is gradually reduced till the acceptance rate is
below a pre-deﬁned threshold. The stability of a given sequence and
corresponding structural conformation was evaluated with the Medusa
force ﬁeld (Ding and Dokholyan, 2006), which includes van der Waals,
solvation, hydrogen bonds, electrostatics, statistical potential for back-
bone-dependent amino acid identity and rotamer and reference energy for
the unfolded states. The atom types and corresponding van der Waals
interaction parameters were taken from CHARMM (Brooks et £11., 1983).
The solvation energy was approximated by the LazaridisiKarplus impli-
cit solvent model (Lazaridis and Karplus, 1999). The distance- and angle-
dependent hydrogen bond interaction parameters were adapted from
Korternme and Baker (2002). We used the DebyeHLickel approximation
to model the screened chmtharge interactions at the physiological
condition, namely pH~7 and salt concentration ~0.1 M, and the
corresponding Debye length was ~10A. The weights for different
energy terms and the reference energy of unfolded state were determined
by recapitulating the native amino acid sequence of a set of high-
resolution protein structures (Yin et £11., 2008).

Owing to the stochastic nature of the simulated annealing algorithm,
multiple simulations were often performed to compute the average
stability of a given sequence. We used the PDB structure of SAP]
(Teramoto et £11., 2013) to model the bound complexes (Fig. 2A).
We chose a nine-residue window with the sulfated tyrosine as the sixth
residue similar to the reference peptide in the crystallography structure. It
has been experimentally shown that these ﬂanking residues are important
for both TPST binding and catalysis (Lin et £11., 1992). For a given
mutation, 100 independent simulations were performed for both the
native and mutant protein (or proteinipeptide complex). The stability
was estimated as the average value over all simulations, and the
mutation-induced stability change was then obtained as the difference
between mutant and wild type.

2.4 Positive and negative datasets

To test whether a parameter can be used to differentiate the sulfated and
non-sulfated proteins, we compiled a list of experimentally veriﬁed
sulfated peptide/proteins (positive dataset) and a list of non-sulfated
peptide/proteins (negative dataset). For the positive dataset, we collected
a list of 160 non-redundant tyrosine-sulfated peptide/proteins by combin-
ing both Sulﬁnator (Monigatti et £11., 2002) and dbPTM (Lu et £11., 2012)
datasets, which were extracted from the UniProt database (Bairoch et £11.,
2005). Many proteins had more than one sulfated tyrosine. Similarly,
based on Sulﬁnator, a list of 159 peptideproteins was constructed for
the secreted proteins that do not undergo sulfation.

2.5 Secondary structures and relative solvent accessibility
predictions

We used the NetSurfP (Petersen et £11., 2009), a protein surface accessi-
bility and secondary structure prediction web-server, to estimate a
peptide’s structural propensity in terms of relative solvent accessibility,
Pm, and various secondary strucutres, Pa, Pﬂ and Pan-l. A benchmark
study by the developers (Petersen et £11., 2009) indicated that the
prediction accuracy of NetSurfP is comparable with other best publicly

the average propensities, Pa, Pﬂ, PM, and PM, over the nine-residue
window around a given tyrosine of interest.

2.6 Z—score and Z—score minimization

For a given parameter x, derived for both the sulfated and non-sulfated
sequences, we deﬁned the Z-score:

where 8X is the standard deviation. The averaging was done separately for
all peptides belonging to sulfated and non-sulfated datasets. The Z-score
quantiﬁes the separation between the x-value distributions of the two
datasets.

Determinants of TPST sulfation specificity

 

To determine the coefﬁcients Ea, ES and Em, in the effective energy
 we minimized the Z-score of Eeﬂ using a Monte Carlo-based simu-
lated annealing. We gradually decreased the Monte Carlo temperature,
and at each temperature multiple rounds of perturbations of the coefﬁ-
cients were applied. The acceptance or rejection of perturbations was
determined according to the Metropolis criteria. As the Monte Carlo
temperature approaches zero, the Z-score was minimized stochastically.
Multiple independent simulations with different random seeds were per-
formed to ensure the convergence.

3 RESULTS

The TPSP-2 enzyme has an N—terminal cytoplasmic domain, a
transmembrane domain anchoring the protein in the Golgi mem-
brane, a putative stem region and a luminal domain that cata-
lyzes the tyrosine sulfation (Teramoto et a1., 2013). The protein
exists as a homodimer and the structure of the catalytic domain
has been solved recently in its dimeric form (Teramoto et a1.,
2013) (PDB ID: 3AP1, Fig. 1A). The peptide binds to a well-
defined deep pocket, a part of which is at the inter-monomer
interface (Fig. 1A).

3.1 The role of electrostatics in peptide binding

The peptide-binding pocket of the enzyme is rich in positively
charged residues. Electrostatics analysis using Delphi (Li et a1.,
2012) (see Section 2) indicates that the electrostatic potential near
the binding pocket is highly positive (Fig. 1B). Even more, the
electrostatic field lines form an electrostatic funnel, which
can drive a negatively charged substrate toward the pocket
(Fig. 1C). Many sulfated peptides have a net negative charge,
typically originating from acidic groups positioned near the tyro-
sine. For example, in many cases the sulfated tyrosines are
ﬂanked by two acidic residues, providing local net charge of
i2e. This feature was believed to be a necessary requirement
for all sulfated tyrosines (Hortin et a1., 1986). The more recent
discovery of sulfated tyrosines not ﬂanked by acidic residues has
called into question this requirement (Bundgaard et a1., 1997).
However, the net negative charge may still be present because of
more distant acidic residues. The observation that TPSP dimer
forms such a prominent positive electrostatic patch at the dimer
interface suggests that electrostatic interactions between the
TPSP and the peptide are an important feature for the binding
and perhaps for the speciﬁcity of the recognition. To reveal the
interplay between binding afﬁnity and speciﬁcity, we use the
proteinipeptide complex structure to estimate the binding afﬁ-
nities of both sulfated and non-sulfated peptides to investigate
the speciﬁcity of TPST recognition.

3.2 Protein—peptide binding energy

In the complex structure, the peptide conformation is stabilized
by several hydrogen bonds with the enzyme, including both
backbones and side chains (Fig. 1A) (Teramoto et a1., 2013).
To be catalyzed by the enzyme, a substrate peptide has to
assume an appropriate conformation in the pocket such that
speciﬁc TPSTipeptide interactions can be established.
Therefore, it is expected that the corresponding binding afﬁnity
would vary signiﬁcantly with the amino acid sequences, which in
turn would be crucial for the selectivity of peptide sequences for
TPST sulfation. Because it is difﬁcult to estimate the absolute

value of binding afﬁnity AG, we computed the change in
binding afﬁnity, AAGhind, due to mutations with respect to the
reference peptide in the X-ray crystallography structure of the
TPSTipeptide complex (see Section 2). We use Eris W in et a1.,
2007a) to estimate the stability changes on mutations, where the
inter-atomic interactions is modeled with the Medusa force field
(Ding and Dokholyan, 2006). The Medusa force ﬁeld includes
major physical interactions that govern the binding between
peptide and receptor, including van der Waals, solvation, hydro-
gen bonds and electrostatics (see Section 2). The Eris/Medusa
method has been shown efﬁcient in recapitulating protein stabil-
ity changes on mutations with a high correlation between pre-
dictions and experimental measurements W in et a1., 2007a, b).
For the peptides, a window of nine residues is used with the
tyrosine of our interest at the sixth position as for the reference
peptide in the complex structure (Fig. 2A).

We ﬁrst test whether the peptide-binding afﬁnity is the driving
force for tyrosine sulfation by TPST. We constructed a list of
sulfated and non-sulfated proteins that are experimentally vali-
dated (see Section 2). If the peptide-binding energy is the deter-
minant for the TPST sulfation specificity, the sulfated sequences
should have stronger afﬁnities or lower binding energies than the
non-sulfated sequences. We compute the probability densities of
the Eris-derived relative binding afﬁnity AAGbmd for sulfated and
non-sulfated sequences (Fig. 2B). As expected, the sulfated
sequences, in general, have lower AAGbM values compared
with the non-sulfated sequences. Thus, the peptide-binding afﬁn-
ity plays a crucial role in the sulfation selection process.
However, it is also clear from Figure 2B that a signiﬁcant
separation of the two sets of sequences is not achieved on the
basis of AAGbmd values alone. To quantify the separation of two
datasets, the standard score (i.e. Z—score, see Section 2) is
calculated to determine if the separation of two Gaussian-like
distributions is statistically significant. Z-score quantiﬁes the
separation with respect to the standard deviations. A larger
absolute Z-score value indicates a more signiﬁcant separation
of the two distributions. The Z-score for the two distributions
is 70.83, indicating that the separation is within one standard
deviation and thus two datasets are not well-separated according
the peptide-binding afﬁnity alone. Thus, even though the binding
afﬁnity plays an important role in the selection process, there are
additional factors that contribute to the selection of tyrosines by
TPST.

3.3 Local unfolding of the tyrosine-containing peptide

It has been reported that many of the tyrosines that undergo
sulfation are positioned in unstructured regions of the host
protein, although some sulfated peptides contain ordered second-
ary structures (Chang et a1., 2009; Huang et a1., 2012). In their
native structures, peptides that fold into a-helix or ﬂ-sheet
structures in the host protein would not be able to ﬁt into the
TPST binding pocket (Figs 1 and 2A). In other words, these
peptides with well-deﬁned secondary structures would need to
locally unfold to bind to the enzyme. The unfolding of secondary
structures requires energy, making the binding less favorable.
Additionally, to bind to the enzyme, the peptide segment also
needs to break tertiary contacts, if any, with respect to the rest of
the host protein. The energy cost associated with losing these

tertiary contacts also makes the recognition by the enzyme
unfavorable. The number of tertiary contacts is inversely
proportionally to the solvent-accessible surface area (Ding
et a1., 2012). Next, we examine the secondary structures and
solvent accessibility of the sulfated and non-sulfated peptides in
the corresponding host proteins.

The majority of proteins in the UniProt datasets do not have
experimentally determined 3D structures available. As a result,
the secondary structures and solvent accessibilities of the
peptides in our sulfated and non-sulfated datasets cannot be
derived directly from the structure of their host proteins. On
the other hand, bioinformatics tools have been developed to
predict protein secondary structures and solvent accessibility
from sequences with signiﬁcant accuracy. We use the web-server
NetSurfP (Petersen et a1., 2009) to estimate the propensity of a
peptide in terms of relative solvent accessibility, Pm, and second-
ary structure elements, Pa, Pf, and PM, (See Section 2). We ﬁnd
that compared with the non-sulfated sequences the sulfated ones
tend to have weaker propensities for ordered secondary struc-
tures (Fig. 3A and B), and consequently higher propensity for
random coils (Fig. 3C), although the differences are relatively
small with major overlaps of the distributions. Similarly, as
expected, the sulfated sequences also have slightly higher prob-
ability to be solvent-exposed than those non-sulfated sequences
(Fig. 3D). Therefore, local unfolding of the peptide in the host
proteiniincluding both unfolding of the ordered secondary
structures and losing tertiary contacts with respect to the rest
of the protein, the energy cost of which is inversely proportional
to the solvent accessibilityiis also important for the recognition
of the tyrosine-containing peptide by TPST. The thermodynamic
population of the locally unfolded peptides, determined by the
energy cost, is available to bind the enzyme. Similar partial
unfolding of protein substrates has also been observed for
proteolytic cleavage of proteins (Hubbard et a1., 1994) as well
as for both N— (Marshall, 1974) and O-glycosylation (Hansen
et a1., 1998) sites.

3.4 An effective energy for sulfation

Our analysis above suggests that the thermodynamic availability
of the peptideiie. the probability of the peptide to be locally
unfolded and thus accessible for enzyme bindingiis also import-
ant for TPST sulfation (Fig. 4A). We propose a simple energy
cost function for local unfolding of the peptide,
EaPa -l- EﬂPﬂiEum, where the coefficients E0, and Eﬂ
are the energy costs for the unfolding of a-helix and
ﬂ-sheet, respectively. The coefficient Em, corresponds to the
energy cost for losing tertiary contacts. Thus, the total
effective energy for TPST sulfation can be approximated as
Eff = EaPa + EﬂPﬂiEum, -l- AAGbmd -l- C, where C is an ar-
bitrary reference coefﬁcient.

We parameterize the coefficients Ea, E9 and Em, by minimiz-
ing the Z-score of Eff values between the sulfated and non-
sulfated datasets (see Section 2), E0, = 19.1 kcal/mol,
E9 = 24.7 kcal/mol and Em, = 7.5 kcal/mol. We notice that
these energy coefﬁcients are physically sound. For instance, if
all the nine residues of the peptide are forming a helix, the
average energy cost for breaking a backbone hydrogen bond
on unfolding would be ~2 kcal/mol, which is close to the esti-
mated energy of a single hydrogen bond (Deechongkit et a1.,
2004). The distributions of Eff for sulfated and non-sulfated
datasets are shown in Figure 4B. Compared with AAGhmd, the
separation between the two datasets with the effective sulfation

energy is signiﬁcantly improved with the Z-score decreased from
70.83 to 71.03. Therefore, with the effective sulfation energy Eff
the distributions of the sulfated and non-sulfated sequences are
now separated by approximately one standard deviation.

Our results suggest that the substrate peptide’s structural prop-
erties in the host protein and its binding affinity to the enzyme
are both important for the recognition by TPST. One interesting
question is which term in the effective energy contributes the
most in differentiating the two datasets. To answer this, we com-
pute the Z—score for each term separately. The values for the
peptide-binding energy AAGhind, propensities of a-helix Pa,
ﬂ-sheet Pf, and relative solvent accessibility Pm, in the host
proteins, are 70.83, 70.23, 70.29 and 0.42, respectively.
Therefore, the peptide-binding afﬁnity plays a major role for
TPST speciﬁcity while the thermodynamic availability of the
peptide in its host protein also plays a signiﬁcant role. These
two factors together determine the TPST sulfation speciﬁcity,
resulting into great variations in both sequences and structures
of the sulfated proteins.

A better separation between sulfated and non-sulfated
sequences with Eff than other parameters allows us to use Eff
as the predictor to estimate whether a peptide is potentially
sulfated. The Elf distributions of sulfated and non-sulfated
proteins are both Gaussian-like (Fig. 4B). We choose a cutoff
value EL. corresponding to the intersection of these two distribu-
tions such that a protein has a high probability of being sulfated
than non-sulfated if Eff< Er. We set the reference coefﬁcient C
of Eff as 714.6kcal/mol so that E, = 0. As a result, the error
rates for both sulfated (i.e. sulfated proteins with Eﬂ> 0) and
nonsulfated (i.e. non-sulfated proteins with Eff <0) equal to
~15%. Using the same datasets, we compare the performance
of our method with respect to two existing sulfation prediction
servers, Sulfinator (Monigatti et a1., 2002) and PredSulSite
(Huang et a1., 2012). Sulﬁnator successfully predicts 126 of 160
sulfated and 155 of 159 non-sulfated sites, resulting in error rates
of ~21 and ~2.5%, respectively. PredSulSite succeeds in predict-
ing 94 of 160 sulfated and 158 of 159 non-sulfated sites, and thus,
the corresponding error rates are ~41 and ~0.6%. Interestingly,
both Sulﬁnator and PredSulSite have a high success rate for non-
sulfated sequences but with a sacriﬁce of the success rate for
sulfated sequences. On average, our structure-based method
has similar prediction accuracy as these statistics-based tools
with a better prediction of the sulfated sequences. Next, we
examine the applications of effective sulfation energy Eff in
two case studies that are not included in the datasets.

3.5 Sulfated tyrosines in HIV-1 antibodies

Two human monoclonal HIV antibodies, 412d and 47e, have
been identified and puriﬁed from patients. The antibodies con-
tain sulfated tyrosines in their variable loops (i.e. CDR3) that
compete with the sulfated CCR5 receptor for the glycoprotein
gp120 of HIV-1. It has been shown that tyrosine sulfation is
critical for both antibody binding and the efﬁciency of the
viral infection (Choe et a1., 2003; Farzan et a1., 1999).
Antibody 412d has four tyrosines (Y96, Y100, Y100c and
Y1001, Table 1) in the CDR3 loop, and antibody 47e has three
tyrosines (Y100a, Y100g and Y100h) in the loop. The question is
which tyrosine or tyrosines are sulfated by TPST.

We compute for each tyrosine the corresponding nine-residue
peptide’s relative binding affinities, AAGhind, and also the effect-
ive sulfation energy Eff (Table 1). Because all tyrosines are pos-
itioned in the variable loop, the correction of Eff compared with
AAGbmd is relatively small. For antibody 47e, Y100a has the
lowest AAGbmd among the three tyrosines and corresponds to
the only one with Eff <0, suggesting Y100a has been sulfated
by TPST. The corresponding values are also consistent with
other sulfated sequences, suggesting that Y100a is sulfated
(Figs 2B and 4B). The result is consistent with mutagenesis ex-
periments (Choe et a1., 2003). For antibody 412d, we find that
Y1000 has signiﬁcantly lower values of AAGbind and Eff than
other three tyrosines, and the corresponding negative Eff value
suggests that it is sulfated. However, mutagenesis experiment
found that Y100 is also sulfated in addition to Y100c The
unfavorable AAGbmd and Eff values of Y100 in our calculations
are caused by its upstream proline residue P97, which has strong
preference for the backbone dihedral angles. The particular
proline residue is not compatible with the backbone conform-
ation of the TPSTiligand complex, resulting in an unfavorable
conformation. The artifact can be resolved by modeling the
backbone conformational ﬂexibility, whose accurate and rapid
characterization is still computationally challenging and is the
subject for the future studies. Taking together, our method can
be used to predict the potential sulfation sites although there is
room for improvement.

3.6 Sulfation efﬁciency

Incomplete sulfation is often observed for many sulfated
proteins. For example, gastrin, a regulator of gastric acid secre-
tion for digestion, is partially sulfated (Bundgaard et a1., 1997).
Systematic mutagenesis studies have been applied to understand
the sequence dependence of the sulfation efﬁciency, where the
extent of sulfation was measured for many mutants with muta-
tions around the sulfated tyrosine (Bundgaard et a1., 1997). The
extent of sulfation measurement is more quantitative than
the all-or-none descriptions of the sulfated and non-sulfated

Table 1. The relative binding energy AAGbind and the effective sulfation
energy 15‘eff are computed for different tyrosines of interest for HIV anti-
bodies, 412d and 47e

datasets. In addition to the descriptive insight of the sequence
dependence of sulfation efﬁciency derived from the previous
mutational studies, a more quantitative analysis is necessary.
We hypothesize that the extent of sulfation should depend on
both the thermodynamic availability of the peptide and the
peptide-binding afﬁnity, which are described by the effective
sulfation energy, K”. We postulate that the sulfation efﬁciency
should monotonically decrease with respect to the sulfation
energy. For wild type and mutant gastrin (see Supplementary
Table S1 for the list of mutations), we compute the AAGbmd
and Eff and presented the scatterplot with respect to the
sulfation efficiency in Figure 5. Although many mutations are
single-amino acid substitutions, some mutations induce changes
in secondary structure propensities, and thus significantly affect
the energy cost for local unfolding with respect to the host
protein. As a result, we observe a signiﬁcant difference between
AAGbmd and Eff in terms of correlation with respect to sulfation
efﬁciency. As expected, we find a better correlation between the
sulfation efficiency and Eff than that of AAGhmd. Using a linear
regression, we ﬁnd that absolute value of the correlation

Fig. 5. Correlation between sulfation efﬁciency and sulfation energy.
(A) The scatterplot of the experimentally determined sulfation efﬁciency
and computed relative peptide-binding afﬁnity AAGbind for gastrin and its
13 mutants. Two quantities show weak correlation, with a Pearson cor-
relation coefﬁcient of 70.31. (B) Better correlation is achieved by using
effective sulfation energy Eff in which energy costs for unfolding and
desolvation are incorporated. The correlation coefﬁcient is improved
to 70.53

coefﬁcient is improved from 0.31 for AAGbM to 0.53 for Eff.
Owing to inaccuracies in both experimental measurements and
computational estimation of the effective energy, we do not
expect a perfect correlation. Moreover, we also do not expect a
linear correlation between the extent of sulfation and the sulfa-
tion energy for a wide range of energies, although the linear
approximation can exist within a certain energy window.
Therefore, the independent test suggests that the simple effective
energy of sulfation can be used to predict the sulfation efﬁciency
in incomplete sulfation.

3.7 TPST-1 isoform

Our estimation of relative peptide-binding afﬁnity is based on
the structure of TPST-2. The question is whether TPST-1 and
TPST-2 have different binding afﬁnities with respect to a given
peptide. Because the sequence identity between two isoforms is
64% (sequence similarity is ~78%), we expect their structures
are highly similar to each other. We align the two sequences and
build the homology model for TPST-1 using TPST-2 as the
template (Fig. S1). We ﬁnd that the peptide-binding pocket is
almost identical for both isoforms with only two mutations near
the N-terminal of the peptide (Supplementary Fig. SlB). One of
the mutations is arginine to lysine, which maintains the charge.
Therefore, we postulate that a peptide would have similar bind-
ing afﬁnities with respect to TPST-1 and TPST-2. To test this
hypothesis, we calculated the relative binding afﬁnities AAGbM
of HIV-1 antibodies and gastrin mutants to TPST-1 using the
homology model. The AAGbind values of TPST-1 and TPST-2
highly correlate with each other with the Pearson correlation
coefﬁcient r = 0.98 (see the scatterplot in Supplementary Fig.
S2). The slope of a linear ﬁt is 1.07 with an offset of 0.28,
suggesting that peptides have similar binding afﬁnities to the
two isoforms. Because other terms in the effective sulfation
energy depend only on the structure of a substrate protein
instead of the receptor, we expect that the effective sulfation
energies Eff with respect to the two isoforms are also similar,
and thus no signiﬁcant differences in terms of binding speciﬁcity
and the sulfation specificity are observed.

In summary, using structure-based molecular modeling
approaches, we have identified both structural and energetic
determinants for TPST sulfation speciﬁcity. Our results suggest
that both the thermodynamic availability of the peptide in a host
protein and its binding afﬁnity to the enzyme are important for
TPST sulfation speciﬁcity. The thermodynamic availability of a
peptide is determined by the energy cost of peptide local unfold-
ing, where the peptide loses both tertiary and secondary
interactions that stabilize its native structure in the host protein.
The binding of the peptide by TPST is determined by its inter-
actions with the residues in the binding pockets. The interplay of
both peptide thermodynamic availability and enzyme-binding
afﬁnity in determining the TPST sulfation specificity leads to
great variety in sulfated sequences and structures. We have
developed an effective sulfation energy function that combines
both the energy cost for peptide local unfolding and the binding
afﬁnity. Case studies suggest that the simple sulfation energy
function can be used to predict the potential sulfation sites and
the sulfation efﬁciency for incomplete sulfation. The benchmark
study indicates that the predictive power of our structure-based

Determinants of TPST sulfation specificity

 

sulfation predictor is comparable with other statistics-based tools
with a better positive sulfation-predication rate. Besides the
dependence of structural availability, the major differences
between structure-based and statistics-based methods include
computational efﬁciency and transferability. Owing to a large
number of calculations of inter-atomic interactions in our
structure-based method, the statistics-based methods are often
computationally more efﬁcient. However, as our method is
based on physical interaction, we expect it to be transferable
to other applications, such as estimating the effect of mutations
in the TPST enzyme on sulfation speciﬁcity and sulfation pre-
diction for other TPST variants, including the recently discov-
ered bacterial TPSTs. (Han et al, 2012). We also expect that the
proposed sulfation mechanism is also applicable to other post-
translational modiﬁcation systems where the sequence or struc-
tural speciﬁcities are not well-deﬁned.

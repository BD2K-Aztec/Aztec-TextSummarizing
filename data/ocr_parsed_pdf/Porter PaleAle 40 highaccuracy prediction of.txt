Training set Test set Porter (SS) (%) PaleAle (RSA) (%)
Full_set HiRes_set 82.3 56.8 (81)
Full_set 82.2 55.3 (80)
LowRes_set 78.6 49.6 (75.2)
HiRes_set HiRes_set 81.3 55.9 (80.7)
Full_set 80.8 54.2 (79.4)
LowRes_set 77.5 48.4 (74.7)

 

Note: Performances of Porter and PaleAle on sets of diverse quality. When the
training set is Full_set, performances on Full_set and HiRes_set are in 5—fold
cross validation, whereas LowRes_set performances are measured as the average
obtained by models from all 5—folds of Porter and PaleAle. When the training set is
HiRes_set, performances on HiRes_set are in 5—fold cross validation, whereas
Full_set and LowRes_set performances are averages from the 5 training folds.

13000 and 18000, compared with 500(k8000 parameters for
the old Porter and PaleAle. The overall prediction performances
are reported in Table l, alongside the performances of past
versions of the servers. Porter 4.0 predicts 82.2% of all residues
in the correct class, an improvement of 3.1% over Porter
(Pollastri and McLysaght, 2005). PaleAle’s improvement is
0.9% over the 2007 version, for a 4—class correct classification
of 55.3%, or 80.0% when the 4 classes are recast into 2 with an
RSA threshold of 25%. Although PaleAle 4.0 is not optimized
for this task, real valued solvent accessibility obtained from its
class outputs by simple linear regression yields a mean average
error of 0.14.

We also evaluated how the quality of a protein structure re—
lates to the servers’ accuracy (Table 2). Porter 4.0 is only mar—
ginally more accurate on the HiRes_set than on the Full_set
(82.3% versus 82.2%), whereas PaleAle 4.0 is signiﬁcantly
more accurate (56.8% versus 55.3%). Similarly, when we test
the methods on LowRes_set, which contains poor resolution
and NMR proteins, PaleAle’s performances decrease more
markedly from Full_set levels (—5.7%) than those of Porter
(—3.6%). We also trained the full Porter and PaleAle systems
on all 9152 proteins (Full_set + LowRes_set). The overall results
(not reported) were only marginally different, with a fractional
improvement on LowRes_set and a loss of <0.l% on the rest of
the set. Finally, we trained Porter and PaleAle only on HiRes_set
and tested them on all three sets (Table 2). In this case, the per—
formances are significantly lower on all sets for both predictors.

The 5—fold cross validation performance of Porter on HiRes_set
is 81.3%, which is higher than the 2004 results (79.1%), which
were obtained on a similarly sized training set but with older
MSA, but lower than what we obtain on Full_set (82.2%),
which is larger, but based on the same MSA. This seems to sug—
gest that at least some of the gains of the more recent predictors
(Table 1) may come from training set sizes, rather than from the
size of the sequence databases MSA are obtained from.

3 THE PORTER 4.0 AND PALEALE 4.0
WEB SERVERS

Porter 4.0 and PaleAle 4.0 are freely available for academic users
as web servers at the address: http://distillf.ucd.ie/porterpaleale/.
The servers implement an ensemble of all the models from all
folds, that is 5 models by 5 folds or 25 models in total per server.
As this effectively means that the servers are trained on 25%
more proteins than their benchmark in 5—fold cross validation,
their performances are expected to at least match those reported,
although this will have to be validated when new independent
sets will become available in the future.

The interface of the servers requires the user to input the
queries in FASTA format and, optionally, an email address.
Up to 64 kb of input (~200 average proteins) can be processed
in a single submission. Larger predictions can be processed via
subsequent submissions of up to 64 kb each. An exemption from
the 64 kb limit can be obtained on a one—off basis by email
request to the authors. The predictions are returned to the user
as a web page and, optionally, via email if an address is provided.
Links on the response web page also give access to confidence
values for the predictions, and to PaleAle’s outputs mapped
onto real valued RSA. Depending on the load on the queue,
a protein of 300 residues takes as little as 4 min to be processed
and a maximal submission of 64 kb as little as 2h. The sets
used for training the servers are available for download on the
web server.

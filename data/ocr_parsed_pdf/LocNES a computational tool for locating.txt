Abstract

Motivation: Classical nuclear export signals (NESs) are short cognate peptides that direct proteins
out of the nucleus via the CRM1—mediated export pathway. CRM1 regulates the localization of hun—
dreds of macromolecules involved in various cellular functions and diseases. Due to the diverse
and complex nature of NESs, reliable prediction of the signal remains a challenge despite several

attempts made in the last decade.

Results: We present a new NES predictor, LocNES. LocNES scans query proteins for NES consensus—
fitting peptides and assigns these peptides probability scores using Support Vector Machine model,
whose feature set includes amino acid sequence, disorder propensity, and the rank of position—specific
scoring matrix score. LocNES demonstrates both higher sensitivity and precision over existing NES
prediction tools upon comparative analysis using experimentally identified NESs.

1 Introduction

Active transport of macromolecules between the nucleus and the
cytoplasm controls the localization and functions of many proteins
and RNAs. The majority of nuclear—cytoplasmic transport of macro—
molecules is mediated by nuclear transport receptors of the
Karyopherin l)’ (Kap) family, which bind nuclear localization or ex—
port signals (NLSs or NESs) in their cargoes (Conti and Izaurralde,
2001; Gorlich and Kutay, 1999; Tran et (11., 2007; Weis, 2003; Xu
et (11., 2010). CRM1 (for Chromosome Region Maintenance 1, also
known as Exportin—1 or XPO1) is the best characterized export—Kap
or exportin (Fornerod et (11., 1997; Fukuda et (11., 1997; Neville
et (11., 1997; Noske et (11., 2008; Ossareh—Nazari et (11., 1997; Stade
et (11., 1997). Approximately 300 broadly functioning protein car—
goes for CRM1 have been experimentally identified and compiled
into three separate databases NESbase, NESdb, and ValidNESs

(la Cour et (11., 2003; Xu et (11., 2012; Fu et (11., 2013). Many CRM1
cargoes participate in important cellular processes such as gene ex—
pression, signal transduction, immune response, and cell differenti—
ation. Aberrant CRM1—mediated nuclear export causes diseases
such as cancer, viral and inﬂammatory diseases (Etchin et (11., 2013;
Fung and Chook, 2014; Lapalombella et (11., 2012; Turner et (11.,
2012; Zhou et (11., 2013).

Cognate peptide segments in protein cargoes that bind CRM1
are known as classical nuclear export signals or NESs (previously
also known as leucine—rich NESs). NES peptides are usually 8—15
amino acids long with regularly spaced conserved hydrophobic resi—
dues. The first NES consensus of L—X2,3—[LIVFM]—X2,3—L—X—[LI] was
established from results of in vivo NES randomization—selection
assays (Bogerd et (11., 1996). Subsequently, La Cour et al. re—defined
the NES consensus as <I>1—Xz,3—(I>2—X2,3—(I>3—X—CI>4 ((Dn represents

Leu, Val, Ile, Phe or Met; X stands for any amino acid) according to
alignment of 80 experimentally defined NESs (thereafter shortened
as experimental NESs) collected in NESbase (la Cour et (11., 2004).
Inclusion of additional hydrophobic residues significantly increased
the NES consensus coverage. Kosugi et al. further expanded the
NES consensus through analysis of 101 distinct NES peptides ob—
tained from a random peptide library screen (Kosugi et (11., 2008).
The Kosugi set of consensus sequences included four previously
defined patterns, termed NES Classes 1a—d (Class 1a: (ID1—X3—(ID2—X2—
(I33—X—(I34; Class 1b: (Pl—XZ—CDZ—Xz—(IB—X—(IM; Class 1c: (Pl—X34132—
X3—(ID3—X—(ID4; Class 1d: (I>1—X2—(I>2—X3—(I>3—X—<I>4;) and two new
patterns (Class 2: <I>1—X—(I>2—X2—(I>3—X—(I>4; Class 3: (I>1—X2—(I>2—X3—
<I>3—X2—<I>4), to describe additional spacings between key hydropho—
bic residues of their NES peptides. The set of consensus sequences
also allowed Ala, Thr, Cys or Trp to occur only once at hydrophobic
positions of an NES.

Crystal structures of CRM1 bound to NESs from PKICX,
Snurportin—1 and the HIV—1 Rev protein revealed that NESs bind
directly to a groove on the convex surface of CRM1. The NES
groove contains five hydrophobic pockets that accommodate con—
served hydrophobic NES residues (Dong et (11., 2009; Guttler et (11.,
2010; Monecke et (11., 2009). The PKICX (LALKLAGLDI, Class 1a)
and Snurportin (MEELSQALASSFSV, Class 1c) NESs adopt
oi—helical conformations at their N—termini and transition to loops at
the C—termini when bound to CRM1. In contrast, the CRM1—bound
Rev NES (LPPLERLTL, Class 2) adopts an extended conformation.
Examination of CRM1—NES interactions led to a structure—based
consensus, which adds a fifth hydrophobic position at the N—
terminus of the NES ((130) as modulator of CRM1—NES binding
affinities (Guttler et (11., 2010).

Of the different proposed NES consensus patterns, the Kosugi
set of consensus sequences has the highest sensitivity, with 89%
coverage of experimental NESs versus 65% for the la Cour consen—
sus. However, the precision rate of the Kosugi consensus is low (4%
compared to 12% for the la Cour consensus). The generally low
precision rates of the different consensus are probably due to degen—
eracy of the consensus patterns, which describe the 2—turn amphi—
pathic helix that is ubiquitous in the proteome. We refined the
Kosugi consensus sequences based on analysis of 234 experimental
NESs collected in NESdb (Xu et (11., 2012). The refined consensus
only marginally improved the prediction precision (6%), suggesting
that NES consensus sequences alone are insufficient to accurately
locate NESs in CRM1 cargoes.

Several computational tools have been developed to predict clas—
sical NESs. A predictor named NES—Finder (http://research.nki.nl/
fornerodlab/NES—Finder.htm) was the first available web—server to
identify sequence motifs that fit a subset of NES consensus (Classes
1a, 1b, and 1d). ELM is another pattern matching method although
it uses different regular expressions to define NESs (Gould et (11.,
2010). NetNES, developed in 2004, is the first NES predictor that
does not explicitly use consensus patterns (la Cour et (11., 2004).
Instead, it employs machine—learning algorithms like Neural
Networks (NN) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and relies
only on protein sequence as features. NetNES integrates the outputs
of NN and HMM trained with experimental NESs in NESbase to
assign a score to each residue in the input protein. NetNES increased
prediction precision to ~30% at the cost of lowering the maximum
recall rate to ~40% (Fu et (11., 2011). More recently, the NES pre—
dictor NESsential applied simplified consensus patterns to the query
sequence as a pre—filter followed by Support Vector Machine (SVM)
classification that incorporates both sequence and biophysical fea—
tures such as predicted intrinsic disorder, secondary structure and

solvent accessibilities (Fu et (11., 2011). NESsential achieved better
precision at lower recall levels when tested with 85 experimental
NESs collected in ValidNESs. For example, at 20% recall level,
NESsential increased precision by 17% compared with NetNES (Fu
et (11., 2011). In 2014, a NES prediction tool named Wregex was
published (Prieto et (11., 2014). Like NESsential, Wregex scans the
query with regular expressions to generate a list of NES candidates.
A position—specific scoring matrix (PSSM) is then used to compute a
score for these candidates. Comparison between NESsential and
Wregex using NES motifs in human deubiquitinases (DUBs) showed
that Wregex produces fewer NES candidates than NESsential.
However, since Wregex does not incorporate predicted biophysical
features, it takes less time to predict NESs.

In this study, we present a new computational tool named
LocNES to locate classical NESs in CRM1 cargoes. LocNES first
ranks the NES consensus fitting peptides according to its PSSM
score. The PSSM score rank, protein sequence, consensus pattern,
and disorder propensity are used as feature set of a SVM model.
LocNES was tested with a large set of experimental NESs and
showed improved performance over existing NES prediction
methods.

2 Methods

2.1 NES datasets
Entries in two of the most recent NES databases, NESdb and
ValidNESs, were examined and compared. At the time of manu—
script preparation, NESdb and ValidNESs contain 253 and 221 ex—
perimental CRM1 cargoes, respectively. Entries in both databases
were combined and 36 entries with contradicting experimental evi—
dence (listed as ‘NESs in doubt’ in NESdb) were removed. Sequence
similarities among the remaining proteins were detected using pro—
grams CD—HIT (Li and Godzik, 2006; clustering threshold 40%)
and BLASTClust (Altschul et (11., 1997; similarity threshold 10%)
and identified homologs were removed. 246 non—redundant proteins
containing 290 experimental NESs were compiled in a dataset
named the Dbase dataset and listed in Supplementary Table S1.
Thirty—two functional NES motifs and 78 non—functional NES
motifs from 56 DUBs were identified using a nuclear export assay
(Garcia—Santisteban et (11., 2012). A second dataset (DUB dataset)
was constructed with these 110 DUB NES motifs (functional and
non—functional). The DUB NES motifs used in the export assay are
peptides with 19—22 amino acids.

2.2 NES candidates in the Dbase dataset

LocNES scans CRM1 cargoes in both the Dbase and DUB datasets
with a sliding window protocol to retrieve NES candidates (peptides
that conform to NES consensus patterns). The NES consensus
sequences used by LocNES are a modified version of the Kosugi
consensus sequences (Xu et (11., 2012): (ID1—X1,2,3—(I>2—["W]2—(I>3—
[Am—o4; <1)1—x2,3—c1>2—[AW]3—c1>3—[AW]—c1>4; or (1)1—X2—CI32—X["W]2—
<I>3—["W]2—<I>4 (["W] is any of the 20 amino acids except Trp; Ala or
Thr can be used once at (131 or (132; X stands for any amino acid).
Each NES candidate consists of 15 amino acids (shorter if located at
the protein N—terminus). The C—terminal amino acid of each peptide
is (D4 in the NES consensus. If the (DZ—(1)4 portion of an NES candi—
date overlaps with an experimental NES, it is deemed as a real NES.
Otherwise, the NES candidate is defined as a negative NES. By these
criteria, LocNES located 4201 NES candidates in the Dbase dataset.
Among them, 493 NES candidates are real NESs and the remaining
3708 are negative NESs. LocNES found no NES candidate for 42 of

the 290 experimental NESs in the Dbase dataset. LocNES assigns a
zero probability score to these 42 NESs.

2.3 NES candidates in the DUB dataset

NES motifs in the DUB dataset are longer than existing NES consen—
sus patterns. Consequently, LocNES typically retrieves 2—3 NES
candidates from each DUB NES motif. Since experimental testing of
the DUB dataset was conducted at the motif level, LocNES assigns a
probability score to each motif in DUB dataset in the following man—
ner. First, LocNES calculates the probability score for each NES
candidate in the DUB dataset. Then the highest probability score
among NES candidates from the same DUB NES motif is designated
as the probability score of the motif.

Both NESsential and Wregex (the two most recent NES pre—
dictors used in our performance comparison) retrieve NES candi—
dates from query proteins in a similar manner as LocNES. However,
since the three predictors use different NES consensus patterns, the
number of NES candidates retrieved varies among them.

2.4 Calculation of PSSM score

The PSSM used to score peptides in each testing set was constructed
with the NES peptides (aligned at the (134 position) in its correspond—
ing training set. The element in the matrix is calculated as log likeli—
hood ratio of the position—specific probability and uniform
background probability (0.05). A pseudocount of 1 is added for
each position. The PSSM score for a given sequence is calculated as
the sum of log likelihood ratio of every residue.

2.5 Prediction pipeline of LocNES

LocNES first retrieves NES candidates from a query protein (see the
previous section for details). Next, the PSSM score is computed for
each NES candidate and all candidates are ranked according to its
PSSM score. The feature set for SVM model is then constructed,
which includes PSSM score rank, peptide sequence represented by a
vector containing twenty—one indicator variables (one for each
amino acid plus a blank position) for each residue, and the types of
consensus (Classes 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 2, or 3) for the NES candidate.
The feature set also contains disorder propensities, computed with
DISOPRED (Ward et (11., 2004) for every residue of the NES candi—
date and for the 15 residues of both N— and C—terminal peptides
ﬂanking the NES candidate. In addition, LocNES includes an indica—
tor variable that is set to 1 if the NES candidate is located within six
residues of another NES candidate with higher PSSM score rank
(0 if otherwise). To ensure a fair comparison between LocNES and
other NES predictors, our SVM model was trained with 124 NESs,
which are a subset of the 154 experimental NESs that trained
NESsential and Wregex. SVM algorithm was implemented by
LIBSVM integrated in Scikit—learn python package (Chang and Lin,
2011; Pedregosa et (11., 2011). The output of the SVM model is the
probability score of the NES candidate.

2.6 Performance evaluation

Both Dbase and DUB datasets were used to compare LocNES with
NESsential and Wregex. If the probability score of a real NES is
above a pre—defined threshold, it is counted as a true positive.
Otherwise, it is a false negative. If the probability score of a negative
NES is below the pre—defined threshold, it will be counted as a true
negative. Otherwise, it is a false positive. Receiver Operating
Characteristic (ROC) curve and its area under the curve (AUC) are
computed to evaluate NES predictors’ performance. Precision—recall
(PR) curves are also generated. Recall is defined as the fraction of

real NESs whose probability score is higher than a threshold value.
Precision measures the percentage of real NESs among NES candi—
dates with probability score higher than a threshold value.

2.7 Availability of LOCNES

LocNES is freely available at http://prodata.swmed.edu/LocNES.
The web interface was developed using PHP. The only required in—
put is the query protein sequence in FASTA format. A standalone
Linux version of LocNES is available upon request.

2.8 In vitro CRM1—NES binding assays

Expression constructs for 11 different Class 3 NES peptides were
generated by ligation of annealed oligonucleotides into the pGEX—
Tev vector and verified by sequencing. GST—NESs were expressed
and purified as previously reported (Dong et (11., 2009).
Approximately 60 ug of GST—NESs were immobilized on glutathi—
one sepharose beads and incubated with excess human CRM1 in a
total volume of 100 pl for 30 min at 4°C in the presence or absence
of RanGTP. After extensive washing with buffer containing 20 mM
Hepes, pH 7.3, 110 mM potassium acetate, 15% glycerol, 2mM
magnesium acetate, and 2 mM DTT, bound proteins were separated
by SDS/PAGE and visualized by Coomassie staining. GST—NESs
were analysed by mass spectroscopy to detect potential protease
degradation or truncation of the fusion peptides. GST—NESs were
also subjected to gel filtration analysis using the Superdex 200 col—
umn (GE Healthcare) to detect potential aggregation.

2.9 Nuclear—cytoplasmic cellular localization assay
Nuclear—cytoplasmic distribution of EYFPz—NLS—NES fusion
proteins was observed in HeLa cells. Expresion constructs for
EYFPz—NLS—NES fusion proteins were generated by ligation of an—
nealed oligonucleotides into a pEYFPz—NLS(SV40) vector and veri—
fied by sequencing 11 different Class 3 NES peptides. The plasmids
were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Life
Technologies) into HeLa cells that were cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), penicillin—streptomycin and amphotericin B,
seeded onto glass—bottom 24—well culture plates (MatTek) and
grown to 50—70% conﬂuency. Live cells were imaged 24h after
transfection. To determine whether CRM1 mediates the nuclear ex—
port of EYFP2—NLS—NES fusion proteins, transfected cells were also
incubated with 2nM leptomycin B (LMB) for 16 h. Live cell image
acquisition was performed at 37°C in a 5% C02 atmosphere using a
spinning disk confocal microscope system (Nikon—Andor), the
MetaMorph software and analysed using Image] software (National
Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).

3 Results
3.1 The Dbase and DUB datasets

Two datasets, named Dbase and DUB, were compiled for training
and evaluating LocNES. The Dbase dataset contains 246 non—
redundant CRM1 cargoes with 290 experimental NESs culled from
the NESdb and ValidNESs databases (Fu et (11., 2013; Xu et (11.,
2012). LocNES retrieved 4201 NES candidates from the Dbase
dataset (see Section 2.2 for details). Among them, 493 are real NESs
and 3708 are negative NESs.

The DUB dataset was constructed using 32 functional and 78
nonfunctional NES motifs (each 19—22 amino acids long) in 56
human DUBs proteins. Performance comparison using the DUB

dataset was conducted at the motif level with prediction scores
determined as described in Section 2.3.

3.2 Cross—validation of LocNES

NES candidates retrieved by LocNES from the Dbase dataset were
partitioned into a five—fold cross—validation dataset to search for the
optimal parameters for SVM models. Each training set includes
378—409 real NESs and 2828—3076 negative NESs. Each test set
contains 84—115 real NESs and 728—986 negative NESs. Each test
set also includes 6—11 experimental NESs that do not match the
refined Kosgui consensus (details in Section 2.2).

Extensive search of parameter space for both linear and RBF ker—
nel of SVM models were conducted. The penalty parameter (C) for
the linear kernel was sampled from 2’15 to 210. The penalty param—
eter and radius (C, y) for the RBF kernel were sampled from 2’4 to
215 and from 2’15 to 210, respectively. We identified that a linear
SVM model with C : 0.01 produced the largest average AUC value
(0.76) and was used in subsequent performance comparisons. ROC
curves for cross—validation using the linear SVM classifier are shown
in Figure 1.

3.3 Features in the SVM model of LocNES

LocNES incorporates four categories of features in its SVM feature
space to capture both the biophysical and sequence properties of
NES candidate: PSSM score rank, peptide sequence, disorder pro—
pensity and the types of consensus pattern (Classes 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 2,
or 3) for the NES candidate. In addition to these four feature catego—
ries, LocNES also includes a feature that indicates whether the NES
candidate is located within six residues of another NES candidate
with higher PSSM score rank. We name this feature the neighboring
feature. The neighboring feature is introduced based on the observa—
tion that occasionally several NES candidates overlap with a real
NES. We computed the F—scores for LocNES features using
LIBSVM’s feature selection tool on the combined Dbase dataset
(Chen and Lin, 2006). Results showed that among all the features
tested, PSSM score rank has the highest discriminative power and
the neighboring feature ranks the second among all the single fea—
tures by F—score (Supplementary Table S2). An SVM model whose
feature set includes just PSSM score rank and the neighboring

feature produced an average AUC value of 0.71 when tested with
Dbase cross—validation sets. PSSM score is less effective than the
rank of PSSM score (AUC: 0.65). Peptide sequence has a slightly
lower discriminative power than PSSM score rank (AUC:0.70).
Although disorder propensity is less discriminative than PSSM score
rank or peptide sequence, it is still much better than random guess—
ing as an SVM model with disorder propensity as its only feature
gave an AUC value of 0.60 (versus AUC:0.5). This is consistent
with previous findings that NES regions tend to have higher disorder
propensity than false positive matches (Fu et al., 2011; Xu et al.,
2012). Information on NES consensus sequence types is the least dis—
criminative feature (AUC : 0.55). Finally, although NESs found in
available 3D structures tend to adopt ot—helix—loop conformations
and disfavor ﬁ—sheet conformations (Xu et al., 2012), an SVM
model incorporating predicted secondary structure provided no per—
formance improvement beyond an SVM model using disorder pro—
pensity (AUC:0.58). It is likely that other features in our SVM
model already implicitly represent secondary structural information.

3.4 Comparison of LocNES with NESsential and Wregex
using the Dbase dataset

In order to compare the performance of LocNES with NES pre—
dictors NESsential and Wregex, we divided the Dbase dataset into
training and test sets. The Dbase training set contains 124 experi—
mental NESs from 103 CRM1 cargoes. The Dbase training set is a
subset of the NESsential training set, which contains 154 NESs.
Wregex used the same training set as NESsential. The remaining
143 CRM1 cargoes (containing 166 experimental NESs) in Dbase
formed the test set. LocNES retrieved 1847 NES candidates from
Dbase training set: 226 are real NESs (consensus matching peptides
overlapping with experimental NESs) and 1621 are negative NESs
(consensus matching peptides not overlapping with experimental
NESs). A LocNES model was first trained using the parameters iden—
tified in cross—validation with this training set and then the model
was used to locate NESs in the test set.

LocNES retrieved 267 real NESs and 2087 negative NESs from
the Dbase test set. 31 experimental NESs in the test set do not match
the refined Kosugi consensus patterns and hence were not retrieved
by LocNES. Like LocNES, NESsential employs a pre—filter to iden—
tify NES candidates. NESsential found 232 real NESs and 1888
negative NESs from the Dbase test set. NESsential also failed to re—
trieve 41 experimental NESs in the Dbase test set. LocNES is able to
retrieve a few more NES candidates than NESsential because the
consensus sequences used by LocNES is more tolerant than the pre—
filter used by NESsential (CID—X2,3—(I>—X—(I>). Performances of LocNES
and NESsential were evaluated with both the ROC and PR curves.
As shown in Figure 2a, LocNES increases AUC values by 0.1 and
0.14 compared to NESsential’s ﬂat and split modes, respectively.
The PR curves in Figure 2b show that LocNES achieves higher preci—
sion than NESsential at most recall levels.

Wregex is the most recently published NES predictor. The pro—
gram combines regular expression matching and PSSM score.
Several configurations are available in Wregex depending on the
choice of regular expression and PSSM. Here, we used the Wregex
A configuration, which was trained with the NESsential training set.
Since Wregex uses a more restrictive regular expression ([DEQ].
{0,1})([UM])(.{2,3})([LIVMFl)(["Pl{2,3})([LMVFl)(["Pl)([LMIVl)(.
{0,3}[DEQ]) than both LocNES and NESsential, it retrieved only 27
real NESs and 78 negative NESs from the Dbase test set. To com—
pensate for the large discrepancy of real negative NESs between
Wregex and LocNES, we added 2009 true negative NES candidates

when we evaluate the performance of Wregex (i.e. Wregex always
correctly predicts these 2009 NES candidates; 2087—78 : 2009).
However, since Wregex found no matches for 139 experimental
NESs in the test set, its maximum recall rate is only 16% compared
to 90% for LocNES and 85% for NESsential. Consequently, the
AUC value of Wregex is considerably smaller than that of LocNES
and NESsential (Fig. 2a).

3.5 Comparison of LocNES with NESsential and Wregex
using the DUB dataset

The DUB dataset includes 32 functional and 78 non—functional NES
motifs (Garcia—Santisteban et al., 2012). Each NES motif in the
DUB dataset is 19—22 amino acids long. Since NESs of the DUB
dataset were tested at the motif level, performance comparison was
conducted only at the same motif level (described in Section 2.3) to
ensure that all predictors have the same numbers of real positives
and real negatives.

LocNES was able to retrieve at least one NES candidate for each
of the 32 functional and 71 nonfunctional DUB motifs. NESsential
found matches for 32 functional motifs and 75 nonfunctional
motifs. LocNES and NESsential found no matches for 7 and 3 non—
functional DUB motifs, respectively, and the prediction score of
these motifs were set to zero. Wregex failed to find NES candidates

Fig. 3. Performance of LocNES compared with NESsential and Wregex using
the DUB data set. (a) ROC curve. The black dotted line represents random
guessing. (b) PR curve. The DUB test set includes 32 functional and 78 non-
functional NES motifs

for 10 functional and 56 nonfunctional DUB motifs. Thus, the max—
imum recall rate for Wregex is only 69% compared to 100% for
LocNES and NESsential. Figure 3a shows that LocNES gives the
best AUC value among the three predictors. On the other hand,
Wregex achieves the best precision when the recall rate is lower than
40% (Fig. 3b). A meta—predictor that combines LocNES with
Wregex improves the prediction performance on the DUB dataset
compared with individual predictors (see Supplementary Figure S1).
However, such a meta—predictor shows no performance improve—
ment on the Dbase dataset.

3.6 Prediction of Class 3 NESs by LocNES

The NES consensus pattern (ID1—X2—(132—X3—(D3—X2—(D4 for Class 3
NESs was introduced in 2008 (Kosugi et al., 2008). Of the six NES
patterns, only the Class 3 pattern contains two residues between (133
and (D4. ~10% of experimental NESs match the Class 3 pattern.
Signals classified as Class 1b, 1c, 1d, and 2 NESs also have similar
levels of occurrences (Kosugi et al., 2008). Among the 166 experi—
mental NESs in the Dbase test set, 11 contain exclusively Class 3
NES candidates (Table 1). None of the class 3 NESs had been tested
for CRM1 binding. Therefore, we tested these Class 3 NESs for dir—
ect CRM1 binding in pull—down binding assays using recombinant

GST—NESs, CRM1 and RanGTP. Figure 4 shows that seven Class 3
NESs (Rio2, Mad1, CDC7, X11L2, CPEB4, mDia2, and Trip6)
bind CRM1 in stoichiometric manner, further validating them as
real NESs.

We also performed nuclear—cytoplasmic localization assays in
HeLa cells to probe NES activities of the same eleven Class 3 NESs.
As shown in Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure S2, eight of the
eleven NESS (RioZ, Mad1, CDC7, X11L2, CPEB4, mDia2, Trip6
and Nap1) were able to target the EYFPz—NLS reporter to the cyto—
plasm. Among these Class 3 NESs, which show positive nuclear ex—
port activity, the Nap1 NES is the only one that did not bind
CRM1. Interestingly, we observed cytoplasmic localization of
EYFP2—NLS—NES(Nap1) in only 55% of HeLa cells which were
transfected with the plasmid as compared to 100% of cells trans—
fected with the seven CRM1 binders (see Supplementary Table S3).
These results suggest that the Nap1 NES is a very weak NES. The re—
maining three Class 3 NESs (COMMD1, GagPro, and Deaf1)
showed no detectable CRM1 binding nor cytoplasmic localization
in HeLa cells, suggesting that they may have been incorrectly identi—
fied and are likely negative NESs.

NESsential and Wregex were able to identify all four Class 3
non—binders as negative NESs. However, both predictors have 0%
recall rate for the seven Class 3 CRM1 binders since they filter out
peptides with <I>3—X2—<I>4 spacing at the initial stage of prediction.
NES—Finder also does not predict any Class 3 NESs binders since it
only finds NES candidates that fit Class 1a, 1b or 1d patterns.
LocNES is able to retrieve four Class 3 CRM1 binders (mDia2,
Trip6, X11L2, and CPEB4; recall rate 57%) at the default threshold
value of 0.1 (Table 1). LocNES also correctly identified one non—
binder (GagPro) but mislabeled the remaining three non—binders as
NESs. The older NetNES predictor does not employ pre—filtering
and therefore is also able to find some Class 3 NESs. Of the seven
Class 3 CRM1 binders, NetNES identified Class 3 NESs only in
Mad1 and CDC7 (recall rate 28%) using its default cutoff of 0.5.
All four non—binders were correctly identified as such at the same
cutoff. NetNES may have a low recall rate for Class 3 NESs because
few Class 3 NES peptides were identified before 2004. Class 3 NESs
do not fit the traditional NES consensus patterns and were probably
overlooked during experimental searches for NESs. Therefore, the
machine learning algorithms in NetNES (and to a lesser extent
LocNES) may not be optimally trained to recognize Class 3 NESs.
Recall rate for Class 3 NESs will likely increase as more Class 3
NESs are identified and reported.

4 Discussion

4.1 Features that improved LocNES performance

Among all the features employed by the LocNES SVM model, the
rank of PSSM score has the highest discriminative power.
Interestingly, PSSM score is less effective than PSSM score rank
(AUC 0.65 versus 0.71). The enhanced effectiveness of PSSM score
rank may be due to over—representation of Class 1a NESs among ex—
perimental NESs (Xu et al., 2012). Since the PSSM score of a se—
quence measures how closely it resembles known NESs, a real NES
that doesn’t fit class 1a spacing may have a low PSSM score. For ex—
ample, the zebrafish protein st1, a paired—like subclass of homeo—
domain protein, was shown to have a highly conserved Class 1b
NES (31GFRSKGFAITDLLGL45; Knauer et al., 2005). LocNES
gave the st1 NES a rather low PSSM score of 0.56 but ranks it the
highest among all NES candidates within st1. As expected, a SVM
model using PSSM score rank as a feature produced a higher predic—
tion score for the st1 NES than a SVM model using the absolute
PSSM score as a feature (0.26 versus 0.09). The PSSM currently
used by LocNES may not be large or diverse enough to completely

Fig. 5. Nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of EYFPz-NLS/NES fusion proteins in
HeLa cells. DIC, YFP (pseudocolored in yellow), Hoechst (pseudocolored in
blue) and YFP merged with Hoechst images were captured using a spinning
disk confocal microscope (60x). DIC images are shown in Supplementary

sample the entire range of experimental NESs. It will be important
to update the PSSM as more NESs are identified experimentally, as
prediction performance will likely improve with a more balanced
and representative PSSM.

Although LocNES uses PSSM to represent sequence information,
incorporation of sequence into SVM model did produce a small but
obvious improvement to the prediction performance (AUC increased
by 0.04). There appears to be additional implicit information
encoded in the sequence that enhance CRM1 binding or export ac—
tivity of NESs but yet not detected by PSSM. Sequence analysis of
CRM1 cargoes collected in NESdb revealed that real NESs exhibit
distinct amino acid composition from negative NES candidates. In
particular, acidic residues such as Asp and Glu are more prevalent in
the non—conserved positions in real NESs (Xu et al., 2012). These
negatively charged residues may form electrostatic contact with the
basic amino acids that lined the NES binding groove as observed in
structures of CRM1—NES complexes, thus increasing the CRM1—
NES binding affinity. In addition, the presence of bulky amino acids
like tryptophan in negative NES candidates, which is absent from
the C—terminus of real NESs, can potentially cause steric clash with
the narrow groove at the C—terminal end of NES binding groove and
prevent binding of negative NES candidates.

Incorporation of disorder propensity noticeably increases
LocNES prediction performance. In fact, the disorder status of the
sequence on the C—terminal side of NESs is among the top—10 rank—
ing features (Supplementary Table 2). The developers of NESsential
also reported similar findings (Fu et al., 2011). It has been noticed
that intrinsically disordered region of a protein often contain func—
tionally important sites due to its flexibility and modularity.
Comparison of the disorder scores between real NESs and negative
NES candidates revealed that sequences flanking real NESs have
significantly higher disorder scores than sequences surrounding
negative NES candidates. In addition, examination of existing three—
dimensional structures containing real NESs or negative NES candi—
dates showed that real NESs are more likely to locate at the termini
of protein domains or flanked by long loops (Xu et al., 2012). The
location of real NESs near protein termini and within loops or dis—
ordered regions may increase their accessibility to CRM1 or enhance
their adaptability for suitable CRM1—binding conformations.

LocNES outperforms existing NES predictors in Class 3 NES
prediction. To explore which features of LocNES enhance Class 3
NES prediction, we computed the F—scores on Dbase dataset with
the Class 3 NESs removed (Supplementary Table S4). Comparison
between Supplementary Tables 2 and 4 showed that the neighboring
feature, which indicates if another NES candidate is in close proxim—
ity (details in Section 3.3), is not among the top—10 ranking features
when Class 3 NESs are not included in the dataset. Instead, amino
acid identity at positions 6 and 14 become top ranking features, as
well as the NES consensus type (if the NES candidate belongs to

Class 1a). These feature changes when Class 3 NESs are removed from
dataset demonstrate the prevalence of Class 1a among all experimental
NESs. Furthermore, it indicates that the neighboring feature boosts
Class 3 NES prediction performance. If the weight of Class 3 NESs is
increased in the dataset (doubled or tripled), the F—score of the neigh—
boring feature becomes slightly higher than the corresponding value
calculated with the original Dbase dataset. Since the mean value of
neighboring feature of real Class 3 NESs is higher than that of the
negative Class 3 NES candidates, it seems that real Class 3 NESs
tend to locate close to other NESs of higher PSSM score rank.
Incorporation of neighboring feature likely helps to raise the prediction
score for these Class 3 NESs. One interesting feature of Class 3 NES is
that the spacing between its (132 and (134 ((D2—X3—(ID3—X2—(D4) is the same
as the spacing between (131 and (133 of a Class 1a NES ((D1—X3—(ID2—X2—
(133). Therefore, there are some instances where a Class 3 NES and a
Class 1a NES overlap the same experimental NES. For example, it
was shown that human CPEB1 protein (Uniprot ID: Q9BZB8) harbors
an experimental NES 92ANDLCLGLQSLSL104 (Ernoult—Lange et al.,
2009). Two NES candidates can be found within this experimental
NES: ANDLCLGLQSL (Class 3) and LCLGLQSLSL (Class 1a). We
assume both NES candidates are real NESs since it is impossible to
pinpoint which NES candidate is functional without elaborate point
mutation studies. It is likely that both NES candidates are indeed func—
tional. They may possess different binding affinities to CRM1 or the
two NESs may act concertedly as a high—affinity NES with five hydro—
phobic residues (<I>1 in Class 3 NES acts as (130) as described by the
structural—based consensus (Guttler et al., 2010). In the case of the
CPEB1 protein, the prediction score of the Class 3 NES is almost the
same as the Class 1a NES despite of the lower PSSM score rank of the
Class 3 NES compared with the Class 1a NES.

4.2 Machine learning algorithms in NES prediction
Among the three NES predictors that we compared in performance
analysis, Wregex is the only predictor that does not rely on a super—
vised machine—learning algorithm. Instead, it relies on PSSM to cap—
ture the intrinsic contribution of each residue to NES activity. While
PSSM based methods have proven a useful tool for annotating func—
tional sites, the low recall rate of Wregex indicates that PSSM by itself
is insufficient in predicting NES. The major advantage of Wregex is
its speed. It only takes seconds for Wregex to process a large number
of proteins. Both NESsential and LocNES need time to generate fea—
tures (such as disorder propensity or solvent accessibility) for ma—
chine—leaming methods. Typically, it takes two minutes for LocNES
to process a protein with N6 00 amino acids. However, since machine—
learning methods are especially suited for pattern recognition prob—
lems when the patterns are not easily described by a well—defined set
of rules, the potential improvement in prediction performance out—
weighs the extra cost in time. In NES prediction, machine—learning
methods may be a contributing factor to the significantly higher recall
rate of LocNES and NESsential. Furthermore, incorporation of PSSM
together with sequence and structural properties of NESs into the fea—
ture set of machine—learning algorithm may further boost LocNES
performance. Both NESsential and LocNES implemented machine—
learning algorithm using SVM. We also experimented with Random
forests, another popular machine learning classifier. When the same
feature sets were used, Random Forests performed similarly as SVM
models (data not shown).

4.3 Prediction at the protein level
In addition to determining NES locations within CRM1 cargoes,
NESsential also attempted classification of NES—containing proteins

versus non—NES—containing proteins. LocNES, on the other hand,
assumes that the query protein is a CRM1 cargo and focuses on
locating NES sites within the query. The lack of a large and reliable
negative training/testing data is the major reason for this decision.
NESsential selected 541 proteins annotated in Uniprot as located in
only one compartment, either the nucleus or the cytosol, as non—
NES containing proteins. There is concern that cellular localization
information in Uniprot may not be up—to—date due to the rapid dis—
covery of CRM1 cargoes. A quick search showed that among the 13
CRM1 cargoes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae collected in NESdb,
20% or three proteins (Hsp70, MCM3 and Map1), are annotated as
localized to either the nucleus or the cytosol thus fitting the
NESsential criteria of non—NES containing protein (Liku et al.,
2005; Scott et al., 2009; Shulga et al., 1999). Furthermore, nuclear
import and export processes are highly regulated. Many CRM1
cargos are modified and accessible to CRM1 only in specific cellular
or signaling states. Therefore, steady state subcellular localization of
protein may not reﬂect their status as CRM1 cargoes or inform on
their localization upon stimulation from external cues or change of
cellular states.

Enhanced performance of LocNES compared with NESsential
and Wregex resulted from a more tolerant pre—filter, a more repre—
sentative feature set for machine—learning models, a more accurate
training dataset, and the combined use of machine—learning method,
position specific scoring matrix and biophysical properties of NESs.
As more CRM1 cargoes/NESs are discovered, increased size, diver—
sity and accuracy of experimental NES databases will continue to
improve training/testing datasets for future NES predictors. The
rapid growth of high—resolution protein structures will also guide
identification of NES candidates that are inaccessible to CRM1 and
thus increase precision of NES prediction. Finally, advances in mod—
eling conformational changes induced by post—transcriptional modi—
fication or binding partners may facilitate the discovery of highly
regulated NESs and similarly increase the sensitivity of NES
prediction.

5 Conclusion

LocNES is a supervised machine—learning algorithm to predict NESs
in potential CRM1 cargoes. LocNES integrates the rank of PSSM
score, peptide sequence, disorder propensity and NES consensus
type into an SVM model. Performance comparison between
LocNES and two latest NES predictors, NESsential and Wregex
using two separate test datasets showed that LocNES achieved
higher precision at most recall levels with more than 0.1 increase of
AUC value than NESsential. LocNES produced at least 30% higher
maximum recall rate than Wregex. In addition, LocNES is the only
tool that can predict Class 3 NESs with over 60% recall rate at the
default threshold.

ABSTRACT

Summary: We are constructing an ontology for traditional Korean
medicine, and we started with medicinal materials to express
the relationships between patients’ symptoms, diseases and
treatments. Biological materials and mineral resources have been
used traditionally for patient treatments. The ontology includes
various data related to these materials, such as their scientific names,
parts of materials used, effectiveness and related oriental organ of
the human body.

1 MOTIVATION

Although the knowledge systems of traditional medicine and modern
medical science differ, comparative studies and applied approaches
are valuable. Symptoms are practically identical from a patient’s
point of View, apart from cultural and linguistic differences. Patients’
symptoms and the prescribed treatments are important ﬁelds with
which to link modern medical science to traditional medicine.

For these purposes, we are constructing an ontology of traditional
Korean medicine (TKM) for symptoms, diseases and treatments,
and we are starting out by focusing on the knowledge of medicinal
materials in traditional treatments.

For traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), the following related
works have been done. Zhou et al. (2004) stored a Uniﬁed TCM
Language System (UTCMLS) in relational databases, but it is
not shared on the Web. To overcome the problem of semantic
heterogeneity and to encode the domain knowledge in a reusable
format, an integrated approach to developing and applying the large-
scale domain ontology was proposed (Chen et al., 2007 and Mao
et al., 2008); however, this ontology is not available to the public.
The Chinese herbal database (www.tcmbasics.com/materiamedica
.htm) is available in plain text, but only 116 herbs are currently

included; the botanical names used in China are listed in this
database.

We included more medicinal materials in China and Korea. This
resource is available to the public and viewable in the Web Ontology
Language. It will be available in a public ontology repository as soon
as it is ready.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

We used Protege (protege.stanford.edu) for the design of the
ontology. We then extracted individual medicines and their property
values and wrote them using Jena (jena.sourceforge.net). Knowledge
was acquired by domain experts without using natural language
processing. More than 60 000 triples were extracted verbatim from
the Korean Pharmacopoeia (Korea Food and Drug Administration,
2008), traditional medical books and textbooks adopted by most
Korean universities. Errors in the extraction and writing processes
have not been measured so far.

2.1 Medicinal materials and properties

We have acquired data about traditional medicinal materials, as
shown in Table 1, from the literature.

Most medicinal materials are biological materials, but by-
products of living things and mineral resources are also used.

part used; family names; nature; ﬂavor; toxicity; meridian entries;

effectiveness; and the chief virtue of the medicinal materials are
included in this ontology.

Compared to the Chinese Herbal Database, the most basic
property types are similar and the property values of many medicinal
materials used in Korea are similar to those of the materials used in
China. However, the scientiﬁc names of the original materials are
quite different according to their local characteristics.

To clarify the difference between Korean and Chinese medicines,
the names of the original material in the languages of the two
countries, including the botanical, zoological and mineralogical
names, have been included. Chinese data was acquired by
referring to the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (Chinese Pharmacopoeia
Commission, 2005). More than 800 materials between the two
countries are included (Table 2).

2.2 Indication: mapping symptoms and disease

Most medicinal treatments of TKM use a combination of a number
of medicinal materials that are known as formulas. Even so,
each medicinal material has information pertaining to the curing
symptoms or particular conditions that indicate the advisability or
necessity of a speciﬁc medical treatment or procedure. An indication
of a medicinal material can be a disease, a pattern or a symptom.
Essentially, a material is recorded to treat complex cases, including
compound symptoms, symptoms by a certain disease or pattern,
symptoms or diseases due to a certain cause and a disease that exists
given in a particular condition of a patient, among others.

These complex cases from materials cannot be simply mapped
onto a single disease or symptom. It is necessary to understand the
effect and functions of a material and the treatment method of a
disease pattern (Table 3).

2.3 Translation of the property values into English

The property values of individual medicines, including the names,
were written in Chinese and Korean ﬁrst and were then translated

into English in reference to the Korean—English Dictionary of
Oriental Medicine (Compilation Committee of Dictionary, 2004)
and the WHO International Standard Terminologies on Traditional
Medicine in the Western Paciﬁc Region (World Health Organization,
2007). Values in Chinese or Korean that are recorded in neither the
dictionary nor the stande will be translated by domain experts of
traditional medicine and by medical information experts.

3 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

Most terms and concepts from oriental medicine, including TKM,
must be understood and mapped out carefully. Moreover, the
knowledge represented in this ontology must be interpreted with
an understanding of oriental medicine. Every value in it is from
written records, but the representation does not include everything.

The contents represented as RDF triples in this ontology are
facts based on the books used, but some combined knowledge
may express incorrect information. Studies of the measurement and
correction of these entries are required.

Plants, animals and minerals can be connected to a proper
ontology, and the treatment information should be linked to the
disease ontology of traditional medicine as well as to the disease
ontology of modern medical science. Knowledge of medicinal
treatments in traditional medicine will be useful due to their
relationship to diseases, and this knowledge should be supported
by analyses of the relationships between traditional diseases and
modern diseases. By comparing other traditional medicines and
applying clinical data, knowledge from relevant books can be
assessed and a model for it can be modiﬁed practically.

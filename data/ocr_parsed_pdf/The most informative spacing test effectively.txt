The most informative spacing

 

difference between the two MLEs for subgroup center, increases
with the product of the MLEs for subgroup size and decreases
with the sum of the two MLEs for variance. Tong et a]. (2013)
showed that SIBER identified bimodally expressed features
equally or more effectively than several other methods proposed
in the bioinformatics literature (Teschendorff, 2006; Tomlins,
2005).

Intuitively, the differences between consecutive ordered data
values are very informative regarding the existence of outliers or
multiple modes. Pyke (1965) called these differences ‘spacings’
and derived their theoretical properties under many statistical
models. Pounds (2001) successfully used Pyke’s work to accur—
ately estimate the fraction of clonable DNA. Therefore, we use
Pyke’s theory to develop two novel OASIS methods for analysis
of transcriptomic expression data.

2 METHODS

Suppose that we have measured the expression of g = 1, . . . , G features
(RNA-seq read count regions or microarray probe-set) for each of
i = 1, . . . , n subjects. Let yig represent the raw expression value of feature
g in subject i. Let I(-) be the indicator function that equals one if the
enclosed statement is true and zero if the enclosed statement is false.

2.1 Positive quantile transformation

We use the positive quantile transformation (PQT) to normalize expres-
sion values. For each subject i, the PQT of each expression feature j is
deﬁned as

1 G
xy- = $210.»,- 2 yignoig >0) (1)
z g2]

where m,» = 2:21 I(yig > 0) is the number of features with a positive raw
expression value for subject i. Note that the PQT value Xi) is the empirical
quantile of the raw expression value yif against all positive raw expression
values observed for subject i. Thus, Xij = 0.5 implies that the raw expres-
sion value y,-,~ is greater than or equal to half of the strictly positive raw
expression values observed for subject i. If all X>0, then the PQT is
simply a quantile transformation. By deﬁnition, Xij = 0 for each yij 5 0.
Also, the maximum positive raw expression value y,-,~ for subject i is as-
signed Xij = 1 for its PQT value. Thus, for each i and j, the PQT value Xi)
has the simple biological interpretation as the raw expression of feature j
relative to that of the features with positive raw expression in subject i.

In the next six sections, we describe OASIS methods that are applied to
the normalized expression values Xi) of each feature j separately. Thus, for
simplicity of notation, we omit the subscript j and index the normalized
expression values only by the subject i.

2.2 L00

L00 procedures are widely used in the genomics literature to identify
outliers. For each subject i, these procedures compute the mean )2,» and
standard deviation 3,- of the remaining observations (with subject i left
out). Then, for each subject i, an outlier t-statistic is computed as
,1. =  (2)
s%<1+<n — 2W)

This outlier t-statistic is based on the form of a 1 — oz prediction interval
that covers 1 — oz of a population of normally distributed observations
(Hocking, 2005). For each observation i, an outlier P-valuep, is obtained
by comparing the outlier t-statistic t,- to a central t-distribution with n72
degrees of freedom. In this way, an outlier t-statistic t,- and P-value p,- are

computed for each subject i. Thus, there are a collection of outlier
t-statistics and outlier P-values.

There are two ways to summarize the outlier t-statistics and outlier
P-values into one metric of the evidence that an outlier exists. First, the
minimum outlier P-value (MOP)

MOP = miinp,» (3)

measures the evidence that there is at least one outlier. However, MOP is
driven by only one of the outlier tests (the one with the minimum
P-value). The sum of squared t-statistics (SST)

SST = 2 if (4)
[:1

is a summary which is driven by the results of all n outlier tests. Note that
the LOO outlier t-statistics are not probabilistically independent because
each pair of distinct outlier t-statistics is computed with n 7 2 observations
in common. Thus, it is not straightforward to derive the joint null
distribution of the LOO outlier t-statistics, the null distribution of the
L007MOP, or the null distribution of the L007SST.

Therefore, we use simulation to compute P-values that characterize the
signiﬁcance of the MOP and SST statistics. We compute the SST
and MOP for each of a large number B of datasets of independent and
identically distributed standard normal observations of sample size n.
This yields a set of b = 1, ...,B MOP statistics MOP], and a set of
b = 1, . . . , B SST statistics SSTb. The P-value that characterizes the sig-
niﬁcance of the observed MOP statistic MOPO is the proportion

B
13 = %2 I(MOPb : MOPO) (5)
1):]

of simulated MOP statistics that are less than or equal to the observed
MOP statistic. Similarly, the P-value that characterizes the signiﬁcance of
the observed SST statistic SSTO is the proportion

1 B

’ = — I T, > T 6

p B;(ss,,ssO> ()

of simulated SST statistics that are greater than or equal to the observed
SST statistic.

2.3 LMS

LOO is a robust method to detect a single outlier, however Rousseeuw
(1984) shows that LOO is not robust at detection of multiple outliers.
When multiple outliers are present, some outliers are still included in the
variance estimate 3? computed when each observation i is left out. As
shown in Figure 1A, the inclusion of these outliers enlarges the variance
estimate 3? and thereby decreases the LOO outlier t-statistic of Equation
(2) and increases the corresponding LOO outlier P-value. Thus, the pres-
ence of multiple outliers masks their own detection by LOO.

To address this issue, Rousseeuw (1984) introduces LMS as a robust
method for outlier detection. Rousseeuw (1984) argues that the concept
of outlier is meaningful only in the context that there exists some ‘bulk’ of
densely distributed observations. Rousseeuw (1984) deﬁnes the bulk
of the data as the narrowest interval that contains at least 50% of the
observations and suggests that outliers are observations that are very
distant from that bulk.

To identify the bulk of a set of ordered observations
X0) 5 X(2) 5 - - - 5 X(,,), ﬁrst determine the ceiling of half the number of
observations h = [rt/2]. Next, compute the width

W(i) = X(i+/771) _ X(i) 

of each of the i=1, ...,n —h+l intervals that contains exactly h
observations. The index i‘ that minimizes Equation (7) indicates that
the interval [X(i~+/7,1),X(i~)] deﬁnes the bulk of the data.

Fig. 1. OASIS Methods. (A) The LOO, LMS and SIBER methods. The
x-coordinates of the points at the bottom show the observed data values.
LOO leaves out one point (highlighted in light blue) and then ﬁts a
normal distribution to the remaining points (light blue curve). The
value of the left-out observation is compared to the normal distribution
obtained by leaving it out. LOO repeats this process for every observa-
tion. LMS identiﬁes the narrowest interval that covers 50% of the ob-
servations (shown by the points highlighted in purple) and determines the
normal distribution with central 50% that matches this interval (shown
by the purple curve). LMS then compares all points to this normal dis-
tribution. SIBER fits two component mixtures of normal distributions
(shown in brown) and then calculates distance between in a form of a BI.
(B) The maximum spacing test (MAST) and DT methods. The black
points show the observed data values (x-coordinate value) and their
EDF (ycoordinate value). MAST determines the largest difference
between consecutive ordered data values (shown by the red line) and
compares its value to the distribution of the largest difference between
consecutive ordered independent uniform(0,l) observations (data not
shown). DT determines the cumulative distribution function of the best
ﬁtting non-parametric unimodal distribution (shown by the gray curve)
and then determines the largest difference between the ﬁtted curve and
the EDF (shown by the dark blue line)

We then use the identiﬁed bulk x(,--) 5 x(,--+1) 5 - - - 5 x(,--+,,,1) to com-
pute an outlier t-statistic and P-value for each observation. Let

1 II.+,7*1

be the center of the bulk of the observations and let

X -. L — X -.

be a scale estimate based on the bulk, where 207520.674 and
2025 = —0.674 are the upper and lower quantiles of the standard
normal distribution. The scale estimate 3,-- is obtained by assuming that
the bulk represents the inter-quartile range of a normal distribution.
Finally, compute the outlier t-statistic

for each observation i. The denominator uses the term (n — 1)’2/3 be-
cause (Andrews, 1972; Shorack and Wellner, 1986) has shown that J?)-
converges at the rate )1“. An outlier P-value p; is obtained for each
subject by comparing the outlier t-statistic [,7 to a central t-distribution

with n 7 2 degrees of freedom. The collection of outlier P-values can be
summarized by SST and MOP statistics. However, the null distribution of
the LM87SST and LM$MOP statistics is not easy to derive because the
underlying LMS outlier t-statistics are functions of the same data and
thus are not probabilistically independent. Thus, the signiﬁcance of the
SST and MOP statistics are determined by simulation as described in
Section 2.2.

2.4 DT to detect multimodality

Hartigan and Hartigan (1985) developed the DT to detect multimodality
in a distribution of data values. Multimodality in a data distribution
clearly indicates the existence of distinct subgroups. The DT compares
the observed EDF of the data to the UDF that minimizes the maximum
difference between the EDF and the UDF (Fig. 1B). Hartigan and
Hartigan (1985) call this minimax difference the dip statistic. A large
value of the dip statistic indicates that the empirical distribution is
substantially different from any unimodal distribution.

Hartigan and Hartigan (1985) prove that the uniform distribution is
the asymptotically ‘least favorable’ unimodal distribution in the sense
that the uniform distribution tends to give the larger values of dip statistic
than any other unimodal distribution. Thus, Hartigan and Hartigan
(1985) recommend using the uniform distribution as the null in testing
the hypothesis that a distribution is unimodal. Hartigan and Hartigan
(1985) do not derive the null distribution of the dip statistic but only pro-
vide look-up tables to compute P-values by interpolation. Apparently,
the null distribution has yet to be derived because the ‘diptest’ package
still relies on these look-up tables. Therefore, we compute the dip statistic
for the observed data and compute a P-value by comparing its value to
the distribution of dip statistics obtained from a large number of simu-
lated uniform(0,l) datasets with the same sample size.

2.5 SIBER

Tong et a]. (2013) propose the SIBER method. SIBER uses maximum
likelihood to ﬁt a two-component mixture model (Banﬁeld and Raftery,
1993; Fraley and Raftery, 2002) to the data values of each expression
features (Fig. 1A). For each expression feature, maximum likelihood
yields the estimated centers )2] and ﬁg, scales (if and rig and mixing
weights ft] and ﬁg for the two components. The parameter estimates
are used to compute a BI deﬁned as

Blz—IM1_M| m (11)

7%] 6'12 + 7'22 
for each expression feature. SIBER can ﬁt one of three different para-
metric models: a negative binomial mixture, a generalized Poisson mix-
ture and a log-normal mixture. Tong et a]. (2013) do not derive a null
distribution for the BI. A threshold for the BI to declare signiﬁcance may
be obtained by computing the BI for a large number of datasets simulated
from a one-component model of the same parametric family. Also, one
may simulate from the uniform distribution to compute a P-value for the
BI because Hartigan and Hartigan (1985) have shown that the uniform
distribution is the unimodal distribution that is most difﬁcult to resolve
from a bimodal distribution.

Thus, we obtain a P-value for the BI by comparing the observed value to
a set of BI values obtained from a series of simulated uniform(0,l) datasets
with the same sample size. Nevertheless, for the convenience of users who
would prefer to compute P-values by simulating normal(0,l) datasets, our
package also computes P-values by simulating normal(0,l) datasets.

2.6 Maximum spacing test

Pyke (1965) rigorously derived the theoretical statistical properties of
‘spacings’, the differences between consecutive order statistics. Given a

 

1402

ﬁm'spzumofpmjxo'sopeuuopnorq/ﬁdnq

The most informative spacing

 

set of n ordered data values X0) 5 X(2) 5 - - - 5 X(,,), the n 7 1 spacings are
deﬁned as

do) = X<i+1> — Xe) (12)
for i = 1, ..., n — 1. Intuitively, a large spacing indicates a wide gap in
the empirical distribution of the data values that may be due to multi-
modality or outliers (Fig. 1B).

Therefore, we use Pyke’s (1965) theory of spacings to develop the
maximum spacing test (MAST) hypothesis testing procedure.

dmax = miax d(i)-  

We use the uniform(0,l) distribution as a null model. Pyke (1965) shows
that the spacings of a set of independent and identically distributed uni-
form observations are asymptotically independent and identically distrib-
uted beta(l,n) variables. The distribution of d1le is then simply derived
from the distribution of the order statistics of a set of beta observations
(Casella and Berger, 2001). This ﬁnal distribution is used to compute a
P-value for the d1le statistic.

2.7 Most informative spacing test

We borrow concepts from SIBER (Tong et al., 2013) and MAST (Section
2.6) to develop the most informative spacing test (MIST). First, for each
pair i = 1, ...,n — 1 of consecutive ordered data values (X(,»), X04”), we
deﬁne the ‘spacing information’

i(n — i)
(n - 1)2

 

V(i) = 2[(06041) — X(i)) (14)

as a statistic that measures both the magnitude of the spacing and its
informativeness in terms of partitioning the data into distinct groups.
Note that Equation (14) incorporates both the magnitude of the spacing
(X041) — X(,»)) and size of the two groups it deﬁnes with  which is
similar to the term x/fnﬁz in the BI of SIBER shown in Equation (11).

Next, we deﬁne

 

Vinax = max V(i)  

as the most informative spacing statistic. The MIST procedure compares
the observed value of v1le to its distribution across a large collection of
independent and identically distributed uniform datasets with equal
sample size. The constant k is chosen such that the term 2k  attains
a maximum of 1 in the case that one-half of the observations equal 0 and
one-half of the observations equal 1. A P-value for MIST is computed by
simulating from the uniform(0,l) distribution because the incorporation
of the term  in Equation (14) goes beyond the scope of Pyke’s
(1965) so that 1t is not trivial to derive the null distribution for MIST.

2.8 Conceptual comparison of methods

Each method has a distinct set of strengths and limitations. The LOO
methods of Section 2.2 tend to assign greatest signiﬁcance to features with
one very extreme outlier. This property allows LOO to effectively identify
features with rare but extremely potent modiﬁcations in their expression.
Thus, LOO will be very effective at identifying features involved in rare
events that totally silence genes that are typically highly expressed or
induce extreme overexpression in genes that are typically silenced.
However, technical artifacts may also cause rare but extreme outliers,
so caution must be exercised in attributing a biological explanation to
any identiﬁed outliers. Furthermore, LOO will not identify features with
multiple outliers or multiple modes due to overestimation of variability as
described in Section 2.3.

LMS can effectively identify features with single outliers, multiple out-
liers or two modes. By using the narrowest bulk of observations to esti-
mate center and scale for outlier identiﬁcation, LMS can effectively assign
signiﬁcance to any feature with one or more outliers. LMS can also

identify multimodal features as long as the narrowest bulk of observa-
tions is contained within one of the modes. LMS7MOP will assign the
greatest signiﬁcance to features with at least one very extreme outlier, and
LMS7SST will assign greatest signiﬁcance to features with two very
narrow modes with a very wide separation. However, LMS may not
effectively identify features with three or more modes because the nar-
rowest bulk may span across two or more modes. In such a case, LMS
would not assign a large signiﬁcance because it would include between-
group variability in its scale estimate much like LOO does in the multiple
outlier case. A copy-number-variable feature with copy-number-driven
expression may have three or more modes.

DT identiﬁes features with signiﬁcant evidence of multimodality. Thus,
DT will identify features with two or more modes, but will not identify
features with a small number of outliers. DT will also not identify features
with a single mode at zero and a long right tail (such as a gene with zero
expression in most cases but non-zero expression in other cases).

SIBER assigns the greatest statistical signiﬁcance to features with a
distribution that can be characterized by two very narrow modes (small
scale estimates 812 and 6%) of equal size (ft = 1 — ft = 0.5) that are widely
separated (large lﬁl — ﬁll) as seen in Equation (11). Clearly, any feature
with expression values satisfying all three of these conditions would be of
great biological interest. However, Equation (11) also indicates that fea-
tures with small 81 and 82 will also have a very large BI and thus be
considered signiﬁcant. In applications with discrete expression measure-
ments prone to inﬂation of zero or other small values (such as RNA-seq),
SIBER may ﬁt a mixture model with two point masses (61 a 62 a 0) to
the data and obtain a very large BI even if the difference between centers
lﬁl — ﬁll is small but non-zero. This pattern of adjacent point masses is
likely due to sampling variability and not of biological interest. This
technical limitation of SIBER may be overcome by carefully selecting
which parametric model is best to ﬁt to the data. However, it is unlikely
that any particular parametric model is appropriate for every feature.
Methods that automatically incorporate model selection have been
developed for differential expression analysis (Pounds and Rai, 2009;
Pounds et al., 2012), but unfortunately these techniques have not been
incorporated into SIBER.

MAST and MIST are based on spacings and do not use any scale
estimator, as do LOO, LMS and SIBER. Instead, MAST relies exclu-
sively on the magnitude of the spacings and MIST considers the magni-
tude and relative location of the spacings. These features ensure that
MIST and MAST are robust against the ‘adjacent point masses’ techni-
cality to which SIBER is sensitive. Unlike LMS, MAST and MIST do
not assume that some ‘bulk’ must account for 50% of the data. Also,
MAST and MIST are sensitive to detection of features that are technic-
ally unimodal but have a long right tail (a feature that is silenced in a
subset but shows variable non-zero expression in other cases). However,
this strength of MIST and MAST may also be a limitation in some
settings. MIST and MAST will not assign a large signiﬁcance to features
with two biologically distinct modes with small variance that do not have
a large absolute difference between their centers. The factor  in
Equation (14) gives MIST greater sensitivity than MAST to detect
spacings that divide subjects into two groups of roughly equal sizes; how-
ever, this factor also diminishes the sensititivy of MIST to detect spacings
that deﬁne smaller subgroups relative to that of MAST.

We recommend that P-values for LOO-MOP, LOO-SST, LMS-MOP
and LMS-SST be computed by simulating from a single-component
normal distribution, and P-values for the DT, SIBER and MAST be
computed by simulating from a uniform distribution. The theory for
LOO and LMS has been derived for the normal distribution (as indicated
by the use of t-statistics). The theory for spacings and the DT was derived
for the uniform distribution. To use SIBER as a test of unimodality, we
recommend the uniform distribution as the null because Hartigan and
Hartigan (1985) have shown that the uniform distribution is the unimodal
distribution that is most difﬁcult to resolve from a bimodal distribution.

For the convenience of users who may prefer to use other distributions
for the null, the software computes a P-value based on simulation from
the normal distribution and a P-value based on simulation from the

3 RESULTS

We evaluate the methods described above by their performance
on the RNA—seq and exon microarray data for pediatric acute
megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) of Gruber et a]. (2012) and
on the RNA—seq data for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in The
Cancer Genome Atlas (https:/ /tcga—data.nci.nih. gov).

3.1 Pediatric AMKL data

Gruber et a]. (2012) collected RNA—seq and exon array expres—
sion data for 14 cases of pediatric AMKL. Using the clipping
reveals structure (CREST) algorithm (Wang et al., 2011) that
ﬁnds reads which span fusion junctions, Gruber et a]. (2012)
discovered that seven cases harbor a CBFA2T37GLIS2 fusion
transcript which overexpresses GLIS2. Gruber et a]. (2012) also
observed that CBFA2T37GLIS2 status is strongly associated
with prognosis and the expression of many other genes. Thus,
the CBFA2T37GLIS2 fusion gene deﬁnes a distinct molecular
tumor subgroup (TSG) of AMKL. They also discovered sev—
eral other fusion transcripts that were present in only one
subject each.

RNA extraction, gene expression proﬁling and sequencing
have been previously published (Gruber et al., 2012). Briefly,
RNA was extracted from samples using TRIzol and run on
Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Arrays. Affymetrix Human
Exon 1.0 ST Array data for pediatric AML profiling has been
deposited in the NCBI gene expression omnibus (http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under GSE35203. Affymetrix signal
data were obtained by robust multichip average as implemented
in Affymetrix Power Tools. For RNA—seq, libraries were con—
structed as previously described (Zhang et al., 2012). Flow cells
were loaded onto an Illumina GA IIx for a paired—end 101 cycle—
sequencing run using SCS version 2.6 software and SBS version 4
reagents. The resulting base call ﬁles were converted to fastq
format and used in the analysis pipeline. The Burrows7Wheeler
alignment algorithm (Li and Durbin, 2009) was used to map
reads to the reference human genome assembly GRCh37—lite.
Sequencing data is deposited in the dbGaP database (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) under the accession number
phs000413.v1.p1.

For each sample, we counted the number of reads that were
mapped to each RefSeq annotated exon. To quantify the alter—
natively spliced isoforms, we focused on the reads spanning exon
junctions.

We used the PQT of Section 2.1 to normalize the RNA—seq
exon expression data, RNA—seq exon—junction expression
data, microarray exon expression data and microarray gene—
expression data. Each of the four datasets were normalized sep—
arately. We then applied each of the eight OASIS methods
described above to each of the four datasets.

First, we checked each method’s results for analysis of each
form of GLIS2 expression data (Fig. 2). LOO did not identify
any outliers in GLIS2 expression as signiﬁcant at the p = 0.01

(B) RNA-seq junction read-count data, (C) exon array exon expression
data and (D) exon array gene expression data. Each panel shows the
results of DIP, MIST, MAST, SIBER, LMS and LOO for the indicated
form of data. The DIP results are indicated by the vertical bar and two
points in the right margin of the plot. The two dots indicate the vertical
positions that deﬁne the dip statistic, the maximum vertical distance be-
tween the EDF (step function deﬁned by black dots) and the best-fitting
UDF (shown by the gray curve). The length of the bar corresponds to the
value of the dip statistic that has p = 0.01 so that signiﬁcance at the
p = 0.01 level is indicated by the dots falling beyond the endpoints of
the bar. The results of MIST, MAST, SIBER, LMS and LOO are shown
in the bottom margin. For each of these methods, the length of the bar
indicates the distance between the two points that deﬁnes signiﬁcance at
the p = 0.01 level. For MIST and MAST the two points correspond to
the data values that deﬁne the spacing of interest. For SIBER, the points
correspond to the estimated means of the two-component mixture model.

level in any of the four datasets. In sharp contrast, LMS found
outliers at the p = 0.01 level in all four datasets. Furthermore, in
three of the four datasets, the outlier calls by LMS perfectly
discriminated between CBFA2T37GLIS2 fusion cases (Fig. 2A,
B and C). In all four datasets, the maximum spacing perfectly
separated cases with the CBFA2T37GLIS2 fusion from the other
cases. MIST and MAST identiﬁed a significant spacing that per—
fectly separated the fusion—positive and fusion—negative cases in
the RNA—seq exon—read data (Fig. 2A and B). The maximum
spacing in the microarray exon data was not signiﬁcant by
MAST; however, MIST did find that this spacing was significant
because it separated the data into two equally sized groups
(Fig. 2C). DT and SIBER obtained a significant result for all
four datasets (Fig. 2). Thus, all methods except LOO successfully
identiﬁed GLIS2 as signiﬁcant at the p = 0.01 level in the ana—
lysis of the RNA—seq datasets; DT, SIBER and LMS successfully
identiﬁed GLIS2 as significant at the p = 0.01 level in all four
datasets.

Figure 3 illustrates the data of the RNA—seq exon identiﬁed
as most signiﬁcant by each OASIS method. DIP, LMS—SST,
MAST and MIST each identified an exon of XIST (hg19,

Chr23:73045950—73046451) as most signiﬁcant (Fig. 3A); this
exon perfectly discriminates subjects according to gender and
was among the 1000 most signiﬁcant features by SIBER and
LM$MOP. LM$MOP identiﬁed an exon of HOXB9 (hg19,
chr17:46698518—46700497) as most signiﬁcant (Fig. 3B); LM$
SST also placed this exon among its top 1000 results. This find—
ing is biologically relevant because CREST identiﬁed a novel
NIPBL7HOXB9 fusion in the case with the greatest expression
of HOXB9. SIBER identiﬁed an exon of ADAD1 (hg19,
chr4:123350781—123350970) as most signiﬁcant (Fig. 3C); this
exon was not among the top 1000 hits by any other method.
This result illustrates how SIBER is prone to ﬁtting models
with adjacent point masses to discrete expression data (Section
2.8). LOO7MOP and 7SST identiﬁed an exon of OLIG3 (hg19,
chr6:137814842—137815278) as the most signiﬁcant finding
(Fig. 3D); LM$MOP, MAST and MIST also placed this
exon among their top 1000 hits.

We also evaluated the OASIS methods in terms of their ability
to identify genes that perfectly discriminated subjects according
to gender, perfectly discriminated subjects according to the pres—
ence of the prognostically relevant CBFA2T37GLIS2 fusion, or
were involved in one of the other fusions. We used the Wilcoxon
rank—sum test to test all features for differential expression ac—
cording to CBFA2T37GLIS2 fusion status and test all features
on the X or Y chromosome for differential expression according
to gender. We then used the method of Gadbury (2003) to esti—
mate the false discovery rate (FDR; Benjamini and Hochberg,
1995) for those features that perfectly discriminate subjects ac—
cording to CBFA2T37GLIS2 fusion status. Of the four expres—
sion datasets, the RNA—seq exon expression gave the smallest
FDR estimate for both the gender comparison (2.8%) and the

CBFA2T37GLIS2 comparison (1.9%). We then designated each
gene with one of these exons We also assigned the ‘other—fusion
related’ designation to each gene involved in one of the fusions
identiﬁed in only one case.

Table 1 shows the number of features of these three designa—
tions that were included among the 1000 most signiﬁcant results
by each of the eight methods in the analysis of each of the four
datasets. MIST identiﬁed the largest number of CBFA2T37
GLIS2 discriminating features in the analysis of the RNA—seq
exon, RNA—seq junction and microarray gene expression
datasets. MIST also identiﬁed the second largest number of
CBFA2T37GLIS2 discriminating microarray exon expression
features. Only MIST was among the two best methods at includ—
ing CBFA2T37GLIS2 discriminating features in the analysis of
all four datasets.

MIST was also among the two best methods at including
gender discriminating features among the 1000 most signiﬁcant
ﬁndings in the analysis of the RNA—seq exon, RNA—seq junction
and microarray exon expression datasets (Table 1). None of the
methods identified a large number of gender—discriminating
features in the analysis of the microarray gene expression data.
Thus, MIST most robustly identiﬁed gender discriminating fea—
tures in this cohort.

LM$SST, MAST and SIBER identiﬁed the largest or second
largest number of features involved in one of the singleton fu—
sions in each of the four datasets (Table 1). However, none of the
methods identiﬁed a very large number of these features because
so few features were involved in one of the singleton fusions.

3.2 Adult AML data

As of July 31, 2013, RNA—seq data for 157 adult cases of AML
were available from the Cancer Genome Atlas (https://tcga—data.
nci.nih.gov). We used a similar approach to evaluate the per—
formance of the methods on this data. We identiﬁed 43
gender—related (GDR) features as those located on chromosomes
X or Y that were differentially expressed between males and
females. We also identiﬁed features that were differentially
expressed according to the presence or absence of the t(8;21),
t(15;17), t(9;11), and inv(16) translocations. We identiﬁed fea—
tures that were underexpressed in cases with 5q deletion or
underexpressed in cases with 7q deletion and located in those
regions. Similarly, we identified features that were overexpressed
in cases with trisomy 8. In this way, we identified 5634 TSG
features as benchmarks. All these benchmark features were sig—
niﬁcant by the rank—sum test at the 1% FDR level by the method
of Benjamini and Hochberg (1995).

The last four rows of Table 1 show the results. LM$SST
identiﬁed the largest number of TSG features in both the
RNA—seq exon and RNA—seq junction data. MIST identiﬁed
the largest number of gender related features in both the
RNA—seq exon and RNA—seq junction data. LM$MOP,
MAST, SIBER and the DT each identiﬁed the second largest
number of gender or TSG features in one of the four compari—
sons involving the TCGA cohort.

3.3 J ackknife evaluation

We also used the jackknife method (Quenouille, 1949) to evalu—
ate the stability of our results in terms of which method captured

the most features related to TSG or gender for each dataset. The
jackknife repeats the entire analysis on a series of datasets ob—
tained by leaving out one or more subjects to determine the
variability of the analysis results. We repeated the analysis for
all 134 = 364 possible leave—three—out jackknife datasets for the
cohort of 14 cases of pediatric AMKL. We also repeated the
analysis for 100 randomly chosen leave—16—out jackknife datasets
for the cohort of 157 cases of adult AML. In each jackknife
analysis, we identiﬁed the method (or methods in case of a tie)

that placed the largest number of features of each category (TSG,
gender or tumor outlier) among its top 1000 findings.

Table 2 shows the number of jackknife datasets for which each
method placed the largest number features among its top 1000
results for each cohort and data type. MIST was one of the top
two performers in 10 of the 16 settings; LM$SST was one of the
top two performers in nine of the 16 settings (Table 2). Thus, the
jackknife evaluation shows these to be the two most robust meth—
ods among those considered here. In 14 of the 16 settings, the top

performer in the analysis of the original data was also the top
performer in the jackknife evaluation.

We also performed all 114 = 14 possible LOO jackknifes, all
(124) = 91 possible leave—two—out jackknifes and 100 randomly
chosen leave—four—out jackknifes of the cohort of 14 cases of
pediatric AMKL. The results of these jackknife evaluations in
terms of top performing methods were qualitatively similar to
those reported for the leave—three—out jackknife in Table 2.
Supplementary Table S1 gives the results for every jackknife
evaluation we performed.

4 DISCUSSION

Expression features with multimodal distributions or outliers
may indicate modiﬁcation of biological processes that impact
disease pathogenesis or prognosis. OASIS can be useful
tools to discover these expression features. Here, we adapted
Rousseeuw’s (1984) LMS outlier detection algorithm, the DT
of Hartigan and Hartigan (1985) and Pyke’s (1965) theory of
spacings into OASIS analysis methods. We also compared the
performance of these methods to that of the widely used LOO
procedure and the recently proposed SIBER method in two
example applications.

In our ﬁrst example involving a cohort of 14 cases of pediatric
AMKL, six of the eight OASIS methods successfully identiﬁed
GLIS2 as statistically signiﬁcant at the p = 0.01 level in at least
one of the four datasets (Fig. 2). LMS, DIP and SIBER success—
fully identiﬁed GLIS2 as signiﬁcant at the p = 0.01 level in all
four datasets. Furthermore, several of the methods placed hun—
dreds of features that perfectly discriminated subjects according
to GLIS2 status or gender among their 1000 most significant
ﬁndings. Included in the GLIS2 discriminatory features is a
novel putative non—coding RNA molecule that was not picked
up by standard gene expression analysis (data not shown). This
molecule has been validated in the laboratory, and the functional
consequences of the transcript are being interrogated. This indi—
cates that these OASIS methods can successfully discover fea—
tures with expression values that are indicative of important
biological processes.

The results from the pediatric AMKL cohort also illustrate the
strengths and limitations of the OASIS methods described in
Section 2.8. MIST and MAST failed to identify GLIS2 as sig—
niﬁcant in the analysis of the microarray gene expression data
(Fig. 2D) because they do not attempt to compute and use esti—
mates of intra—group variability. By computing and using scale
estimates, SIBER, LMS and DT successfully identiﬁed GLIS2 as
significant at the p = 0.01 level. However, for features with ad—
jacent point masses, SIBER obtained very small—scale estimates
and assigned a very high level of signiﬁcance (Fig. 3C). These
features typically have no mapped reads in most subjects and a
very small number of mapped reads (5 or 6) in a few subjects.
Intuitively, such data are not compelling evidence of potent bio—
logical differences. Our dataset included many features with ad—
jacent point masses of low expression that were among SIBER’s
1000 most significant results. LOO assigns the greatest signiﬁ—
cance to features with one very extreme outlier (Fig. 3D). All of
the 1000 most signiﬁcant features by LOO showed the same
pattern as Figure 3D. One extreme outlier may indicate a bio—
logically relevant feature such as a rare fusion gene; however, an

isolated event is not as interesting as a highly prevalent and
potent aberration from a population perspective. Thus, in prac—
tice, the choice of OASIS method should be guided by the
objective of the investigation, the properties of the dataset, and
the strengths and limitations of the various OASIS methods.

We also evaluated the methods in a cohort of 157 adult cases
of AML. In this cohort, MIST most effectively identified gender—
related features and LM&SST most effectively identified TSG
features. The term  enables MIST to most effectively iden—
tify features with large spacings that divide the cohort into sub—
groups of roughly equal size, such as gender—related features.
However, the term is not as beneﬁcial in identifying features
that deﬁne subgroups that are less equally balanced in terms of
their size. Thus, LM$SST more effectively identified features
that deﬁne the multiple subgroups (each comprising a relatively
small proportion of the entire cohort) of AML. This suggests
that future research should explore the use of other functions
to incorporate information about subgroup size into spacings—
based analysis.

Our results suggest that genomic research may beneﬁt from
more rapidly considering and adopting statistical theory and
methods that were developed and established before the advent
of microarray and next—generation sequencing technologies.
Tong et al. (2013) show that the performance of SIBER is com—
parable to or superior to that of many methods proposed
after the advent of modern high—throughput technologies.
Interestingly, SIBER is a straightforward extension of model—
based clustering which was developed by (Banﬁeld and
Raftery, 1993; Fraley and Raftery, 2002). In our example, the
performance of other statistical methods was comparable or su—
perior to that of SIBER. Thus, it appears that several of the
OASIS methods proposed in recent years have only produced
a mirage of innovation. This observation supports the recom—
mendation that research in computational biology should shift
some emphasis from development of methods to evaluation of
existing methods (Allison et al., 2006). Existing statistical theory
and methods are a valuable and a largely underappreciated
resource for computational biology and genomics research.

OASIS methods may prove useful for other applications in
computational biology and genomics research. Reference align—
ment profoundly improves the accuracy of genomic copy—
number analysis of tumors (Mullighan and Downing, 2009;
Mullighan et al., 2007; Pounds et al.,2009). However, reference
alignment has not yet been used in the analysis of gene expres—
sion data because there is not a method to reliably identify ref—
erence genes (Petrone, 2009). Also, OASIS methods may be used
to select features for class discovery analysis. Future research
should explore the utility of OASIS methods for these purposes.

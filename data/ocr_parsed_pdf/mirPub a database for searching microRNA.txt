Abstract

Summary: Identifying, amongst millions of publications available in MEDLINE, those that are rele—
vant to specific microRNAs (miRNAs) of interest based on keyword search faces major obstacles.
References to miRNA names in the literature often deviate from standard nomenclature for various
reasons, since even the official nomenclature evolves. For instance, a single miRNA name may
identify two completely different molecules or two different names may refer to the same mol—
ecule. mirPub is a database with a powerful and intuitive interface, which facilitates searching for
miRNA literature, addressing the aforementioned issues. To provide effective search services,
mirPub applies text mining techniques on MEDLINE, integrates data from several curated data—
bases and exploits data from its user community following a crowdsourcing approach. Other key
features include an interactive visualization service that illustrates intuitively the evolution of
miRNA data, tag clouds summarizing the relevance of publications to particular diseases, cell types
ortissues and access to TarBase 6.0 data to oversee genes related to miRNA publications.
Availability and Implementation: mirPub is freely available at http://www.microrna.gr/mirpub/.

1 Introduction

 

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, single-stranded endogenous
RNAs, which suppress the expression of protein coding genes. They
are important regulators of many crucial cellular processes and
they are implicated in a multitude of diseases such as rheumatoid
arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer, cancer, etc. (Soifer et 111.,
20071

The number of miRNA-related publications is growing con-
stantly every year, reaching more than 12,700 papers until 2013.
Keyword search to retrieve publications relevant to particular
miRNAs faces three obstacles: (i) publications may refer to the same

miRNA using different names, (ii) publications may refer to
miRNAs with old, obsolete names and (iii) results retrieved as rele-
vant should be carefully examined, since, e.g. sequence changes
might have happened in referenced miRNAs, after the publication
date.

mirPub is a database with a powerful and intuitive interface that
addresses the aforementioned issues. During miRNA literature
search, mirPub takes into account both inconsistencies in naming
miRNAs and the history of miRNA data as being recorded in all
available miRBase (Griffiths—Jones et (11., 2005) versions. mirPub
considers miRNA-publication associations based on text mining

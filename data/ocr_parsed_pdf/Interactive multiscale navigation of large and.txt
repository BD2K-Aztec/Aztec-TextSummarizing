ABSTRACT

Motivation: Many types of omics data are compiled as lists of
connections between elements and visualized as networks or graphs
where the nodes and edges correspond to the elements and the
connections, respectively. However, these networks often appear as
‘hair—balls’—with a large number of extremely tangled edges—and
cannot be visually interpreted.

Results: We present an interactive, multiscale navigation method
for biological networks. Our approach can automatically and rapidly
abstract any portion of a large network of interest to an immediately
interpretable extent. The method is based on an ultrafast graph
clustering technique that abstracts networks of about 100 000 nodes
in a second by iteratively grouping densely connected portions
and a biological-property-based clustering technique that takes
advantage of biological information often provided for biological
entities (e.g. Gene Ontology terms). It was confirmed to be effective
by applying it to real yeast protein network data, and would greatly
help modern biologists faced with large, complicated networks in
a similar manner to how Web mapping services enable interactive
multiscale navigation of geographical maps (e.g. Google Maps).
Availability: Java implementation of our method, named
NaviCluster, is available at http://navicluster.cb.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/.

1 INTRODUCTION

In the post-genomic era, a great number of biological data that
are available via the Internet or obtained through high-throughput
experiments are signiﬁcantly inhibiting researchers from making
sense of the data and communicating them to others in a concise
and meaningful way (Evanko, 2010). Among these, one data type
that has become increasingly common is binary relationship data,
which are deﬁned as sets of elements and 1-to-1 associations

between them. Protein—protein interactions (PPI), correlatively
expressed gene pairs, and genetic regulatory relationships exemplify
this data type. They are conventionally presented using network
(graph) visualization where nodes (vertices) and edges correspond
to the elements and associations, respectively (Merico et al., 2009;
Suderman and Hallett, 2007).

The network visualization is widely used because it is typically
assumed to be more interpretable by humans than a long list
of associations. High quality visualization should allow for
effective investigation of the information, hypothesis generation
and biological discovery (Merico et al., 2009). Unfortunately,
network representations often fail to effectively convey information
to readers in cases where the networks are large and complicated
(e.g. >100 edges). The drawings of such networks, referred to
as ‘hair balls’ (Suderman and Hallett, 2007), occur frequently
when analyzing high-throughput biological data. To avoid being
overwhelmed by such complicated networks, effective navigation
approaches that can abstract data properly and present them
insightfully at a right level of detail are hence required (Gehlenborg
et al., 2010; Hu et al., 2007; O’Donoghue et al., 2010).

Hierarchical Clustering is a technique used with many types of
data, including networks or graphs, that meaningfully groups data
elements in a recursive manner, thereby producing a hierarchy,
or tree, of Clusters (Andreopoulos et al., 2009) (Supplementary
Figure S1). Higher levels in the hierarchy contain fewer, larger
Clusters, each of which encompasses more data elements (or nodes,
in the case of networks) than lower levels. In the case of hair-
balls, some methods (Abello et al., 2006; Freeman et al., 2007;
Pavlopoulos et al., 2009; Royer et al., 2008; Vlasblom et al., 2006)
use hierarchical Clustering to create an interpretable visualization by
displaying only the high-level Clusters, thereby reducing the number
of elements in the ﬁgure and abstracting the networks (e.g. the top
panel in Supplementary Figure S1). By descending the hierarchy and
showing the actual members of each Cluster, detailed information can
still be intuitively shown at a particular scale (e.g. the dotted arrows
and regions in Supplementary Figure S1). A recent study reported
that natural networks display hierarchical properties (Clauset et al.,
2008), suggesting that hierarchical Clustering of biological networks
is both reasonable and promising.

Despite the advantages of hierarchical Clustering, existing
visualization methods using this technique have some drawbacks
that hinder effective investigation of large biological datasets.
First, some methods (Freeman et al., 2007; Shannon et al., 2003;
Vlasblom et al., 2006) require researchers to provide information on

hierarchies or Clusters, data which is usually not known in advance.
Secondly, existing methods do not allow for ﬂexible navigation
beyond ﬁxed Cluster boundaries (Abello et al., 2006; Freeman et al.,
2007; Pavlopoulos et al., 2009; Royer et al., 2008; Vlasblom et al.,
2006). In other words, they can visualize the members of one Cluster
at a time but do not support visualization and navigation of members
of different Clusters, despite the fact that nodes/Clusters of interest to
biologists may belong to various high-level nodes in the hierarchy
(e.g. nodes in the light blue area in Supplementary Figure S1).
Thirdly, existing methods are inappropriate for interactive, real-
time navigation. Researchers frequently Change their focus in the
course of biological investigation to generate hypotheses and need
to visualize different sets of nodes/Clusters. Thus the long running
times (minutes to hours) needed to produce the abstractions are
unacceptable (Abello et al., 2006; Enright et al., 2002; Pavlopoulos
et al., 2009; Royer et al., 2008). Methods that can provide
appropriate abstractions of any given portion of the network rapidly
and automatically, such as those that process about 100 000 nodes in
seconds, are therefore necessary for efﬁcient, interactive biological
investigation. In addition to the previously mentioned problems,
the Clustering techniques employed by existing methods are often
insufﬁcient for abstracting large networks to a level that is simple
enough for interpretation (Abello et al., 2006; Pavlopoulos et al.,
2009; Royer et al., 2008). Recent investigations have revealed that
in some common biological datasets, hub-like nodes tend to connect
with low-degree nodes and the majority of nodes interact with only
few partners (e.g. yeast PPI networks) (Yamada and Bork, 2009).
Large, densely connected regions of such networks are therefore
quite few; instead, small, densely connected modules are more
frequently found. Consequently, even the highest level of the created
hierarchies can contain over 100 Clusters, resulting in Cluttered
and difﬁcult to manage visualizations. Therefore, means for ﬁirther
abstraction are required to allow for effective navigation of large
biological networks.

We developed an interactive, multiscale network navigation
method with three advantages: (i) our method can work without a
user-provided hierarchy; (ii) the method can rapidly, automatically
and interactively produce abstractions of any region of the network,
including nodes/Clusters belonging to different ancestors in the
hierarchy; and (iii) an intuitive visualization with a manageable
amount of information is reliably produced at every step of
navigation. The effectiveness of our method was conﬁrmed using
real yeast protein network data. Our approach will aid modern
biologists faced with large and complicated network data.

2 METHODS

Our method consists of three components: an ultrafast graph clustering
component, a property-based clustering component, and an interface that
presents an abstracted View and permits researchers to ﬂexibly choose
nodes/clusters (Fig. 1). First, the method abstracts the whole network
using the ultrafast graph clustering component. It detects topologically
dense, connected regions, which may correspond to biologically meaningful
clusters, such as protein complexes. It rapidly identiﬁes clusters in huge
networks of about 100000 nodes within a few seconds, thus particularly
suitable to be applied to the problem of interactive navigation of large and
complicated networks. Additionally, if the property-based clustering needs
to be executed afterwards, this graph clustering method displays another
advantage in that it signiﬁcantly reduces the number of clusters to be input
to the next slower clustering.

Secondly, in case the abstraction is insufﬁcient because of the
characteristics of the biological network, the property-based clustering
component further abstracts the network to an extent sufﬁcient for Visual
interpretation. This component automatically groups clusters with similar
biological properties by utilizing the fact that biological entities are often
assigned property information, such as Gene Ontology (GO) terms. The
new clusters resulting from the property-based clustering are used in the
next component instead of those generated by the ultrafast graph clustering
component, thereby reducing the number of clusters on the screen. There
are two main advantages of the property-based clustering: (i) the property-
based clustering allows researchers to directly control the number of clusters
shown on the screen through a parameter K of its underlying algorithm.
To solve the problem of the cluttered Visualization produced by applying
only the graph clustering, the number of clusters shown on the screen
must be decreased to an extent that biologists can manage to interpret. In
addition, because the preferred numbers of clusters on the screen might
differ according to the circumstances, it is important that biologists be
allowed to adjust the number of clusters displayed; and (ii) because the
clusters generated by the property-based clustering are based on the property
information that carries biological meaning, the clusters are expected to be
highly intuitive.

Thirdly, the resultant clusters/nodes are immediately displayed with meta-
edges and property edges, which represent the numbers of edges that exist
between any members of two clusters and the similarities between their
properties, respectively. In the case that the number of clusters is less than
the parameter K , the biggest cluster is recursively split until either the number
of the clusters is equal to K or breaking only one more cluster makes the
number of the clusters larger than K. While showing the abstracted View, the
interface allows researchers to interactively zoom, move laterally beyond
cluster boundaries, focus on an arbitrary set of clusters/nodes, etc. Any
subset of the entire network of particular interest to the researcher can be
fed into the clustering components and the abstracted View of that cluster
is displayed. This cycle can be completed in a few seconds on a typical PC
with a CPU of about 2 GHz and a memory of about 1 GB for datasets with
100000 nodes, permitting truly interactive navigation of large biological
networks.

2.1 Graph clustering

Graph clustering detects clusters in networks by ﬁnding densely connected
sets of nodes where weighted connections of nodes within the sets are
stronger/denser than weighted connections between nodes inside and outside

of the set. This metric is called the modularity, or Q function (Newman
and Girvan, 2004), and numerous graph clustering algorithms have been
developed to identify clusters that optimize modularity (Blondel et al., 2008;
Clauset et al., 2004; Newman and Girvan, 2004; Wakita and Tsurumi, 2007).
The NewmaniGirvan is a well-known, pioneering algorithm that iteratively
removes edges most likely to lie between clusters, splitting the clusters
into two, until no edges remain (Newman and Girvan, 2004). This process
results in a dendrogram (a tree showing the order of the splits) and the
best clustering can be identiﬁed from this tree by choosing the split with
the highest modularity. This algorithm has a high computational cost, as
it requires a traversal of all remaining edges at every step. Until recently,
the best known algorithm developed to overcome this shortage with near-
linear time complexity was devised by Wakita and Tsurumi (Wakita and
Tsurumi, 2007). However, the speed of this algorithm was still insufﬁcient
and the quality of the clusters produced had room for improvement when
incorporated into an interactive navigation of large networks (e.g. human
gene networks of >20 000 nodes) (Blondel et al., 2008). Recently, Blondel
et al. (2008) developed a breakthrough algorithm for quickly identifying
high modularity clusters in huge networks of about 100000 nodes (the
Louvain algorithm). We found that this algorithm for ﬁnding meaningful
communities in large and complicated networks could be applied to the
problem of interactive navigation.

2.2 The Louvain algorithm

The Louvain algorithm works in two phases, as follows:

(1) Starting from the state that each node belongs to a cluster different
from every other node, for each node the algorithm considers its
neighbors” clusters and moves the node to a neighboring cluster. The
cluster to be joined is determined by choosing the movement that
results in the highest positive modularity gain among all possible
movements to the node’s neighboring clusters. If no movements result
in a positive gain in modularity, the node is not moved. This process
is repeated until no members are added to/removed from any clusters
and yields clusters with the maximum local modularity.

(2

V

Every cluster from Phase 1 is then treated as a new node. For each
pair of new nodes, an edge connecting them exists if there is at
least one edge between any member of one of the new nodes and
any member of the other. Edge weights are determined based on the
number of previous edges. Self-loops are drawn on nodes to represent
corresponding inter-cluster edges.

The output of Phase 2 is then fed back to Phase 1 and the algorithm
iteratively runs these two phases until no additional changes are made. More
details of this algorithm can be found in (Blondel et al., 2008).

This algorithm can ﬁnish clustering networks of 70000 nodes in one
second (Blondel et al., 2008). Thus, it works swiftly on many biological
networks that generally contain less than 100 000 nodes (e.g. yeast or
human PPI networks). The ultrafast speed of the algorithm is essential for
accomplishing the goal of truly interactive navigation of large networks.

The clusters produced by this algorithm, which we call Louvain clusters
or LCs, are characterized by high modularity. It has been shown that clusters
with high modularity in biological networks correspond to biologically
functional units [e. g. protein complexes in PPI networks and transcriptional
modules in gene regulatory networks (Dunn et al., 2005)]. Thus, the LCs are
expected to be intuitive and meaningful groups in navigation of biological
networks.

Note that it is also possible to continue Louvain clustering to further reduce
the number of clusters, even if the gain in modularity becomes negative.
However, in such cases, the biological intuitiveness of the clusters produced
would be lowered due to the decreased modularity (Dunn et al., 2005).
Therefore, at this stage, it would be better to adopt another reliable source
of information, in addition to the topology of the networks.

2.3 Property-based clustering

The property-based clustering component aims to decrease the complexity
remaining after the application of the Louvain algorithm by further grouping
LCs based on property information typically associated with the nodes
(Supplementary Figure S2). The Visualization step displays the clusters
resulting from the property-based clustering instead of those generated by
the graph clustering approach, thereby reducing the number of clusters
on the screen. The VisANT tool works similarly to our property-based
clustering and offers integrated Visualization of the GO hierarchy and user-
speciﬁed networks, but it requires the user to manually create clusters
containing the same GO terms (Hu et al., 2009). In contrast, our property-
based clustering automatically generates clusters having similar properties
to achieve interactive navigation.

Let N be the number of nodes in the original input graph and L
be the number of LCs. For each n, where 1 5 nSN, node v” has a
set of terms, T(v,, ), that denotes the properties of the node (e.g. a set
of GO terms). A weight, w (t ), is given to each term t to quantify
its importance (e.g. properties that are rare and/or of particular interest
to researchers may be given higher weights). Let TauEU l <n<1\,T(v,,)
and Tan={tj‘1§j§|Tan|}. For each LC, LC), where 1%[5 L, let
Prop (t, LC) )=| {v e LCllt e T (v ) } l/lLC) |. Then the property vector for
LC) or PV (LC)) is a lTanl-dimensional vector whose j-th element is the
score of term tj, which is calculated as w(tj)Prop(t]-,LC1). (Note that,
in our implementation, a property term to be used for labeling LC) is
the term t;1 which is w(t;1 )Prop(th,LC1 )3 w(tj)Prop(tj,LC1),Vj,15j5
lTanl.) Next, the similarity between two LCs, LC” and LCb, is given as a
normalized dot product of the two property vectors; that is, Sim (LCa, LC), ) 2
PV (LCa )-PV (LC), )/|PV (LCa )| IPV (LC), )I. Then LCs having similar
property vectors are grouped by the Farthest First Traversal K -center (FFT)
algorithm (Andreopoulos et al., 2009). The FFT algorithm is a complexity-
reducing variant of the K -means algorithm, where initial K cluster centers
are chosen as follows. The ﬁrst center (vector) is chosen randomly and each
remaining center is determined by greedily choosing a vector farthest from
the set of already chosen centers. The rest of the vectors are assigned to the
cluster to which they are most similar.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

The proposed method was implemented as a Java 6 Swing
application with a graphical interface for ﬂexible navigation.
The JUNG (Java Universal Network/Graph Framework)
library (http://jung.sourceforge.net) was employed to create the
visualization. Three input ﬁles are required to run the application:
a node list ﬁle, an edge list ﬁle and a property information ﬁle. The
node list ﬁle describes node names, property terms annotated with
the nodes, and database names and IDs used in those databases
(e.g. SGD for yeast proteins). The database information is used to
provide URL links. The edge list ﬁle contains connected pairs of
node names and the weights of the connections (weights describe
how strongly the nodes are connected). The property information
ﬁle describes the property terms in the node list ﬁle: terms’ IDs,
names, display names (used in labeling Clusters in abstracted
views), narnespaces, default weights and their parent terms. In
the case of the GO property information ﬁle bundled with the
software, the default weights are terms’ depths in the GO hierarchy.
This treats more speciﬁc terms as more important properties. In
addition, each term belongs to one of three narnespaces (biological
process, molecular ﬁinction or cellular component). By using the
namespace information, researchers can put heavier weights on all
biological process terms at once if they want to group nodes having
similar biological process terms, rather than other namespace terms.
If parent terms are provided for each term, they are automatically

assigned to the nodes that the term annotates as well. The is_a
and part_0f relationships in G0 are handled by this entry. The
implemented software, NaviCluster, works on any platform that
can run Java 6. The program has a minimum memory requirement
of 1 GB for networks of about 100 000 edges.

In addition to the highlighted features, NaviCluster has many
additional functions designed for interactive network navigation.
Views containing only nodes/Clusters that the user wants to explore
can be created, as well. Undo/Redo ﬁinctions allow users to easily
move backwards and forwards between previously created network
views. As previously mentioned, users can adjust the namespace
factors to Change their importance, which Changes the weights of all
terms in the same narnespaces, as long as at least one namespace
weight is not zero. Furthermore, the number of Clusters resulting
from the property-based Clustering, 12 by default, can be freely
Changed to match the individual preferences of the user. The user
can trace a node of interest easily with the search ﬁinction; the
software can highlight the Cluster in the current graph View that
contains the node of interest. In addition, users can customize the
View according to their preferences in many ways; for example, the
property edges can be ﬁltered based on the similarity value. Besides,
visual appearances are designed to intuitively describe the different
Characteristics of the nodes/Clusters and edges (e.g. node/Cluster
labels, Cluster sizes and edge thicknesses). Context-speciﬁc popup
menus, which contain links to external databases, are also available
to accelerate knowledge discovery and hypothesis generation as
much as possible.

4 RESULTS

4.1 Interactive and multiscale navigation

Our method provides zooming and re-centering functions, which
imitate the functions of common Web mapping services such
as Google Maps. The zooming ﬁinction executes the two-stage
Clustering instantly, using all node members of the selected Clusters
as input, and displays the abstracted network afterwards. Given
researcher-selected nodes/Clusters, the re-centering function runs
the Clustering on all nodes in the entire network whose geodesic
distances to the selected Clusters/nodes are less than/equal to a
provided value. The neighbor nodes do not need to be included in
the current View; this ﬁinction corresponds to the panning ﬁinction
Web mapping services provide to see surrounding regions. The
resulting View shows the Clusters/nodes of interest in the center of the
display, as well as the nearby ‘neighbors’. By Changing the geodesic
distance value, both ﬁne and rough visualization centered on the
Clusters/nodes of interest can be obtained. Note that the zooming
operation can be run on more than one Cluster at a time, useful for
cases where the nodes of interest belong to different Clusters. This
function, as well as the re-centering function, correspond to seeing a
map of several Cities in different countries in Web mapping services
and were not possible with previously existing methods.

ﬁgure in just a few seconds on a typical PC. The log-likelihood
scores indicating the probabilities of true ﬁinctional linkages in
YeastNet were adopted as the edge weights for the ultrafast graph
Clustering component. Edges with high weights connote that the
protein pairs of the edges have strong relationships and thus highly
likely to be grouped in the same Clusters in the ultrafast graph
Clustering. GO terms assigned to the proteins in the SGD database
[http://downloads.yeastgenome.org/ (access date: March 29, 2010)]
were used as property information for the property-based Clustering.
The property-based Clustering was conﬁgured to focus only on
the biological process namespace because we wanted to group
proteins involved in the same biological process. This can be
done by excluding all terms of the other two narnespaces in the
property-based Clustering—which can be easily performed using the
namespace sliders in the implemented tool. The numbers displayed
above Clusters represent the numbers of nodes within the Clusters
and the labels following those numbers are the abbreviated property
terms that can best describe the properties of the Clusters, providing
insight into the biological meaning of the Clusters. Such property
terms are the ones that are shared by most proteins in the Clusters
and meanwhile most speciﬁc (deepest in the GO hierarchy) among
all terms annotated to the proteins in the Clusters (see Section 2 for
details). In case there are more than one Cluster labeled with the
same property term, the next highest score term of each Cluster is
additionally displayed in brackets to discriminate the Cluster from
the others. The display sizes of the Clusters are proportional to linear
normalizations of the numbers of the Clusters over the interval from
the minimum and the maximum numbers among all Clusters. The
color saturations of the Clusters also reﬂect the number of proteins
inside. Meta-edges are drawn between any two Clusters that have
at least one edge between at least one member in each of the two
Clusters (solid lines in Fig. 2). The gray number next to each meta-
edge is the total numbers of all edges existing between the members
of the two Clusters, which are also reﬂected in the thickness of the

pair of Clusters if the similarity between their property vectors,
represented by the associated gray number, is larger than a speciﬁed
threshold (dashed lines in Fig. 3; the threshold is 0.1).

4.3 Untangling hierarchical organization of large and
complicated protein networks

Large biological networks can be interactively navigated in a
multiscale manner as illustrated in Figure 3. Using the YeastNet v.2
dataset as an input network, Figure 3 demonstrates how the zooming
and searching ﬁinctions of our implemented tool can be employed

together to lead researchers to the protein of interest, in this case
Cla4. Cla4 is a p21-activated protein kinase that acts as an effector
of Cdc42. It has been implicated in many important biological
processes such as cell polarization (Bi et al., 2000; Bose et al.,
2001; Gulli et al., 2000), cytokinesis (Benton et al., 1997; Cvrckova
et al., 1995) and exit from mitosis (Bosl and Li, 2005; Hoﬂ<en and
Schiebel, 2004; Jensen et al., 2002; Seshan et al., 2002; Tiedje et al.,
2008). In Figure 3, the Clusters containing Cla4 are highlighted in all
views; the granularities of detail in the views vary from coarsest to
ﬁnest. Each zooming operation (a solid arrow) performs Clustering
on the member proteins of the highlighted Cluster and immediately
shows 12 more detailed Clusters.

In the ﬁrst view, which abstracts the whole network, the Clusters
are labeled with broad biological processes such as DNA repair,
rRNA processing and translation (Fig. 3A). Cla4 is grouped under
the protein amino acid phosphorylation Cluster, which is highlighted.
The members of this Cluster are mostly involved in phosphorylation
processes, that is also true for Cla4, which functions as a kinase
to phosphorylate proteins. After zooming in on the protein amino
acid phosphorylation Cluster, one can ﬁnd Clusters of more speciﬁc
processes, such as mitotic cell cycle spindle assembly checkpoint,
pseudohyphal growth and establishment of cell polarity (Fig. 3B).
In this view, Cla4 is found in the Cluster involved in establishment
of cell polarity, which is consistent with previous studies suggesting
this role for the protein (Bi et al., 2000; Bose et al., 2001; Gulli et al.,
2000). Some Clusters found deeper in this Cluster are Characterized
by actin ﬁlaments or budding processes (Fig. 3C); as expected, they
are related to cell polarity. Cla4 is a member of the regulation of exit
from mitosis Cluster at this navigation level. After zooming in on
this Cluster, the ﬁnal view illustrates the relationships between Cla4
and other proteins such as Gicl, Gic2 and Ste20 (Fig. 3D). In fact,
these proteins were found to be involved in mitotic exit by three
different mechanisms (Tiedje et al., 2008). Cla4 was discovered
to promote mitotic exit and cytokinesis by activating a guanine
nucleotide exchange factor, Ltel, which in turn causes the activation
of Teml, thereby terminating the M phase of the cell cycle (Jensen
et al., 2002; Seshan et al., 2002; Tiedje et al., 2008). In addition,
Gicl and Gic2 were also proposed to be involved in stimulating
mitotic exit in parallel with Cla4 by inhibiting GTPase-activating
proteins of Teml, both of which result in Teml activation (Hoﬂ<en
and Schiebel, 2004; Tiedje et al., 2008). Moreover, Cdc24 and Beml,
which play important roles upstream in the regulation of mitotic exit
(Bi et al., 2000; Bose et al., 2001; Gulli et al., 2000; Tiedje et al.,
2008), are also Clustered together with Cla4 in this view.

This example illustrates that in all views proteins of related
biological processes are Clustered together sensibly and their roles
are indicated informatively, correctly and appropriately based on
the granularity of each view. The amount of information displayed
is kept tractable by showing coarse and ﬁne information on the
abstracted and detailed views, respectively. Every zooming step is
rendered in a matter of seconds, which allows researchers to gather
interesting information at the desired degree of detail easily and
effectively.

4.4 Discovering knowledge about proteins of interest
from a large network intuitively and effectively

As zooming is always performed on all members of selected Clusters,
it alone is insufﬁcient to provide ﬂexible enough navigation for

researchers to explore relationships between some nodes that may
belong to different Clusters. To fulﬁll this requirement, we designed
the re-centering function. By performing re-centering, researchers
can focus on nodes/Clusters of interest and their relationships with
other nodes within a speciﬁed geodesic distance from the entire
network (i.e. not restricted to the nodes contained in the current
View).

Figure 4A shows the view resulting from selecting the proteins
Nas6, an14, and Hsm3 and invoking the re-centering function to
gather all direct interactors. Recent studies have reported that these
three proteins, previously known to bind to regulatory particles
of proteasomes, actually ﬁinction as Chaperones, assisting in the
regulatory particle assembly in yeast (Funakoshi et al., 2009;
Le Tallec et al., 2009; Roelofs et al., 2009; Saeki et al., 2009). In
Figure 4A, the fundamental roles of the three proteins as proteasome-
related proteins are delineated explicitly; speciﬁcally, they interact
with many proteins involved in the ubiquitin-dependent protein
catabolic process.

It is also possible to investigate the relationships between Nas6,
an14, and Hsm3 and other proteins that are farther from them,
to understand their roles in a broader context (Fig. 4B; the
abstracted view collecting all proteins within two hops from the three
selected proteins). In addition to the relationship with the ubiquitin-
dependent protein catabolic process cluster, this view reveals
relationships with other Clusters of more general processes. Among
them, the relationships with the protein folding and cellular response
to heat Clusters actually suggest the recently reported roles of the
three proteins as Chaperones (proteins denatured due to heat are
rescued by Chaperones, which help fold and assemble proteins). It
should be noted that these Clusters were formed without using any
property information from the three selected proteins.

These examples indicate that our method can be used to intuitively
and effectively retrieve knowledge on nodes of interest from
large and complicated networks. Abstraction of the three proteins’
neighbors is necessary because, even if it is possible for biologists
to manually investigate all 49 direct neighbors shown in Figure 4A,
it is not practical to do the same for the 1443 indirect neighbors
shown in Figure 4B. This is a ﬁindamental issue because this
indirect information suggested the Chaperone role; however, it was
not possible to interactively create these views using methods that
depend on ﬁxed Cluster hierarchies.

5 DISCUSSION

To conﬁrm the novelty and capabilities of the present method,
we compared it to other existing visualization methods such as
GenePro (Vlasblom et al., 2006), Power Graphs (Royer et al.,
2008), VisANT (Hu et al., 2009), BioLayout Express3D (Freeman
et al., 2007) and jClust (Pavlopoulos et al., 2009) (Supplementary
Table 1). Our method was the only one capable of representing the
hard-to-manage and complicated visualization of the overwhelming
numbers of nodes and edges and providing the capability to
navigate networks beyond Cluster boundaries. GenePro, BioLayout
Express3D and jClust can visualize Clusters of nodes, but only
at a single level. They do not support visualization of recursive
Clustering. VisANT provides multiscale visualization; however,
the user must manually create metanodes (equivalent to Clusters)
themselves. CyOog (Power Graphs) hierarchically visualizes power
nodes (equivalent to Clusters) created by the Power Graph algorithm,

Fig. 4. Re-centered Views for retrieving knowledge from both direct and
indirect neighbors of proteins of interest in a large network. Two Views
focusing on three proteins related to proteasome regulatory particle assembly
(Nas6, an14 and Hsm3) were created using the re-centering function. Edges
not connected to these center proteins are omitted for clarity. (A) Re-centered
with the geodesic distance from the central nodes set to one. Twenty seven
of the 49 direct neighbors of the three proteins form a ubiquitin-dependent
protein catabolic process cluster, nine form a DNA repair cluster and eight
form a chromatin silencing at telomere cluster. (B) Re-centered with the
geodesic distance set to two. This View delineates the more general functions
of the proteins (see the main text). A large version of this ﬁgure is available
at Supplementary Figure 4.

but the speed is not fast enough to be used for interactive navigation
of large biological networks.

It should be noted that our method is highly extendable in several
ways. First, any type of property information, not just GO categories,
can be used in the property-based Clustering. For example, if
a researcher is interested in diseases, she/he can use disease
names associated with proteins derived from disease databases to
investigate PPI networks by Clustering proteins related to similar
diseases. Secondly, because the Clustering components of the present
method can abstract any sub-network very rapidly, any interactive
function for producing network views of interest can be achieved if
modules for selecting appropriate Clusters/nodes are implemented.
For example, it is easy to devise a module that interactively produces

Interactive, multiscale navigation of large networks

 

networks of genes regulated by a selected regulatory factor, given
information on gene regulatory relationships. Thirdly, the presented
method is not limited to biological applications. In fact, it is general
enough to be tailored to network data from other sources as well,
as long as information adequately describing the properties of the
nodes is provided. For example, citation networks of biomedical
research articles can be explored with the MeSH (Medical Subject
Headings) vocabularies that are stored in the MEDLINE database,
and friendship networks of university students can be explored with
information of class names they attend. In addition, implementing
the method as a plug-in of an existing platform, e.g. Cytoscape
(Shannon et al., 2003) would be a promising way to effectively
integrate the beneﬁts from the method with the abundant features of
the platform, such as connection with important databases.

To summarize, we present the ﬁrst method for interactive and
multiscale navigation of large, complicated biological networks that
displays appropriately abstracted views at all levels of detail. The
specially designed interface, particularly the re-centering function,
enables ﬂexible navigation across cluster boundaries. Application
to real biological network data demonstrates how it achieves the
goal of providing effective, intuitive and interactive navigation, and
why it is eminently suitable for large biological networks. As shown
by analysis of Cla4, every time the researcher zooms in, clusters
were constructed on the ﬂy and visualized immediately along with
meaningful labels. All views were informative as to the hierarchical
structure of the network. As for Nas6, anl4 and Hsm3, their
roles as chaperones were suggested in the view created by the re-
centering ﬁinction, which encompassed the indirect neighbors of
these nodes. This outcome indicates that, in addition to the usual
network exploration accomplished by displaying direct interactors,
our methods can also uncover interesting hidden facts in large,
complicated networks. This feature will help researchers formulate
new hypotheses more easily and systematically, even if they possess
little experience in bioinformatics. We believe that the presented
method will aid modern biologists in discovering knowledge from
massive binary-relationship datasets, which are accumulating at an
accelerating pace.

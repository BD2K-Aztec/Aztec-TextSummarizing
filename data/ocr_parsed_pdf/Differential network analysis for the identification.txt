Differential network analysis

 

Here, we developed and applied a simple but powerful pro—
cedure named DINA (DIfferential Network Analysis), which
differently from other methods does not aim at identifying
de novo subnetworks of genes but rather at identifying whether
a known pathway is differentially coregulated across a set of
conditions. DINA is also able to predict which transcription
factors (TFs) may be responsible for the condition—speciﬁc co—
regulation. DINA requires in input a set of N networks and a set
of M genes, and it aims to identify whether co—regulation among
the M genes in the set changes signiﬁcantly across the N different
conditions.

We first applied DINA to identify tissue—speciﬁc pathways,
and their TF regulators, starting from a collection of ~3000
GEPs across 30 different tissues. DINA correctly discovered
that the amino acid and fatty acid metabolic pathways are
speciﬁcally active in liver and kidney (Hakvoort et al., 2011;
Jagoe et al., 2002), despite the level of expression of these en—
zymes being similar across the tissues. DINA correctly identiﬁed
TFs of the nuclear receptor family as the main regulators of these
pathways. DINA also revealed a novel candidate negative regu—
lator of metabolic pathways, YEA T $2, a gene not well charac—
terized (Wang et al., 2008). We experimentally verified its
association to metabolic pathway regulation using starvation
response in primary hepatocytes (Ding et al., 2009).

We then applied DINA to three different hepatocyte cell lines,
from different stages of hepatocarcinoma (HCC). DINA correctly
predicted that the main metabolic pathways, as well as the p53
transcriptional program, get severely dysregulated in HCC.

2 METHODS
2.1 Database of GEPs

We implemented a GEP database in the open source DataBase
Management System PostgreSQL environment. We downloaded all the
MicroArray Gene Expression Markup Language (Brazma et al., 2001)
annotation ﬁles present in the ArrayExpress repository and extracted the
relevant information on the tissue or cell type for each experiment. We then
re-annoted each experiment in a semi-automatic way using the tissue ontol-
ogy eVOC (Hide 8! al., 2003).

2.2 Reverse engineering of tissue-specific gene
co-regulation networks

We classiﬁed 2930 microarrays (Affymetrix HG-U133A and HG-
U133plus2) extracted from ArrayExpress in 30 different tissues. We nor-
malized microarrays independently for each tissue using Robust Multichip
Average as implemented in the R package Bioconductor (Rafael et al.,
2003) (Supplementary Material). We computed the Spearman Correlation
Coefﬁcient (SCC) (Hardin et al., 2007) for each pair of probes in each
tissue, obtaining a correlation matrix of dimension 22215 X 22 215 (we
excluded control probes) for each tissue. We estimated the SCC signiﬁ-
cance for each pair of probes by computing t statistics of each SCC value
and then using a Student’s t—test distribution to estimate the P-value. To
control the number of False Positives owing to the multiple hypotheses test
problem, we estimated the degrees of freedom of the t—test distribution
from the data by ﬁtting the parameters of a Student’s t—location-scale dis-
tribution to the t statistics computed for all the probe pairs. We estimated
the parameters by minimizing the squared error between the theoretical
and the empirical distribution (Supplementary Material).

In the construction of the SCC matrices, we did not apply any pre-
ﬁltering step to exclude low-variance probe-sets; however, we applied a

stringent threshold (corrected P 5 0.001) to call a SCC value signiﬁcant,
thus reducing the number of False Positive co-regulatory interactions.

To obtain gene-wise SCC matrices starting from the probe-wise SCC
matrices, we first excluded probes that were associated to more than one
gene using the Affymetrix platform HG-U133A Ballester et a]. (2010),
but keeping genes associated to more than one probe.

Speciﬁcally, we mapped 12161 genes from the probes in the HG-
U133A Affymetrix platform (Ballester et al., 2010). Of these 12 161
genes, 68% of the genes were associated to only one probe, and only
11% of genes were associated to >2 probes (Supplementary Fig. S1).

Hence, for the same pair of genes, there could be multiple values of the
SCC because the same gene can be associated to multiple probes in the
microarray. In this case, we chose to assign to the gene-pair, the ‘signed’
maximal absolute value of SCC across all the different probe pairs. At the
end of the procedure, we thus derived 30 gene-wise networks from the
30 probe-wise networks.

An alternative way to transform the probe-wise SCC matrices to gene-
wise SCC matrices would have been to apply a ‘gene centered’ normal-
ization (Ferrari et al., 2007) of the microarrays using a custom CDF,
before the SCC computation, thus eliminating the problem of multiple
SCC values. We however decided to preserve information on possible
alternative transcripts for future work and for experimental validation.
To demonstrate that our probe-wise to gene-wise network transformation
was robust and comparable with the custom CDF approach, we chose as
a case of study the three cancer cell line networks presented in the Section
3.8. We applied a ‘gene centered normalization’ method recently pro-
posed (Ferrari et al., 2007). Finally, we measured the similarity between
the ‘gene centered’ SCC matrices and the one we obtained with our strat-
egy by computing the 2D correlation (Supplementary Table S1). The
results show that the two approaches yield similar SCC values.

2.3 DINA

DINA requires in input a known set of M genes (i.e. genes belonging to a
known pathway, or known targets of a TF), and it aims at assessing
whether the co-regulation among the genes in the set changes signiﬁcantly
across N networks.

We downloaded the full manually curated list of 186 Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways from Msing
(Liberzon et al., 2011). We selected only those pathways consisting of
genes that were present in our gene networks (i.e. at least 80% of the
genes had to be present) obtaining a ﬁnal list of 110 KEGG pathways
(Supplementary Table S2).

DINA uses an entropy like measure to identify in which tissue(s) a
pathway is active. In information theory, entropy is a measure of the
uncertainty associated to a random variable. If V is a discrete random
variable, then the entropy H(V) can be computed as:

N
. 1
H(V) _ ;P(V_ megm

Hence, the entropy H reaches its maximum value when each event is
equi—probable and its minimum, i.e. H(V) = 0, when there is no uncer-
tainty. In our settings, V assumes N categorical values, representing the
N condition-speciﬁc networks. To compute P(V = i), we ﬁrst computed
the number of edges n,- connecting the M genes in the i,,, network (adding
a pseudo-count of 1) for i e {1, . . . ,n}, and we then computed
P(V = i) = 2,5" . P(V = i) can be interpreted as a probability because

Fl (m)

 

it is a number greater than 0 and it sums to 1 across all the N condition-
speciﬁc networks by deﬁnition. P(V: i) will be equal to 1 only when
the genes in the pathway are speciﬁcally co-regulated (i.e. connected) in
network i and not co-regulated (connected) in any other network. Thus,
P(V: i) represents the probability that M genes in a pathway are
co-regulated only in the i,;, network and not in the other networks.

We also developed and tested a slightly modiﬁed version of the
entropy H(V), which also takes into account the pathway topology
(i.e. which genes are connected to which in the known pathway) (Sales
at al., 2012) as described in Supplementary Material. However, in the fol-
lowing analyses, we always used the H(V) formula previously described.

We applied a permutation test in order to assess the entropy signiﬁ-
cance for each one of the KEGG pathways. The null distribution of
H(V) was approximated by selecting a set of N random networks,
with the same density as the original networks, and a set of M random
genes. Random networks were obtained from the original network
by randomly shufﬂing the gene labels. This procedure was repeated
10000 times to estimate the H(V) P-value for each pathway. The
P-value was then corrected using the BenjaminiiHochberg method
(Benjamini et al., 1995).

2.4 Identification of transcriptional regulators of
tissue-specific pathways

We selected 1358 TFs including putative TFs (Supplementary Table S3)
from a list of 1988 human DNA-binding TFs compiled using information
from public repositories (Ravasi et al., 2010). We mapped the TFs onto
the HG-133A Affymetrix platform using only the probe sets associated to
a single gene.

For each TF, we computed the number of edges connecting it to the
genes in the pathway of interest in each of the 30 Tissue Speciﬁc
Co-regulatory Networks. We then assigned a P-value to each TF using
the non-parametric Fisher’s exact test, by comparing, in each tissue,
the number of edges between the TF and the genes in the pathway
with the number of all the possible edges between the TF and the
genes minus the real number of edges. The P-value was corrected using
the BenjaminiiHochberg correction (Benjamini et al., 1995).

2.5 Animals and tissues

Primary cultures of mouse hepatocytes were obtained from two wild-type
mice using the Pichard’s protocol (Pichard et al., 2006). Following col-
lagenase perfusion and sedimentation, primary hepatocytes were washed
and seeded at a density of 105 per well in gelatin-coated dishes (0.1%
Gelatin Type I from porcine skin, Sigma). Cells were cultured in Williams
E medium (Gibco, 12551) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal
bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen), 50 U Penicillin7Streptomycin 100><
Solution (P/S Gibco 15140-122), 1% L-glutamine. After 5h, the
medium was replaced with Williams E medium supplemented with
Hepatozyme-sfm medium (Gibco 17705-021) with 5% heat-inactivated
FBS (Invitrogen), 50U Penicillin7Streptomycin 100>< Solution (P/S
Gibco 15140-122), 1% L-glutamine and ITS 1>< (Insulin Transferrin
Selenium -Sciencell 0803). HeLa cells were seeded at a density of 105
per well in a 6 wells multi-well cultured in complete medium,
Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (GIBCO BRL) supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Invitrogen) and 1% antibiotic/antimy-
cotic solution (GIBCO BRL) and 1% L-glutamine. Primary hepatocytes
and HeLa cells were maintained at 37°C in a 5% CO2-humidiﬁed incu-
bator over-night. After 24 h, the medium was removed and replaced with
starvation medium, Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (Gibco 14025-050)
supplemented with HEPES solution 10 mM.

The cells were collected at different times points from starvation (30
min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h and 8 h). The primary hepatocytes used as control
were seeded at a density of 105 cultured in Williams E medium supple-
mented with Hepatozyme-sfm medium (Gibco 17705-021) with 5% heat-
inactivated FBS (Invitrogen), 50U Penicillin7Streptomycin 100><
Solution (P/S Gibco 15140-122), 1% L-glutamine and ITS 1>< (Insulin
Transferrin Selenium -Sciencell 0803). HeLa cells used as control were
seeded at a density of 105 and were cultured in complete medium,
Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (GIBCO BRL) supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Invitrogen)and 1% antibiotic/

antimycotic solution (GIBCO BRL) and 1% L-glutamine. Animal use
and analyses were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the
Animal Care and Use Committee of Cardarelli Hospital in Naples and
authorized by the Italian Ministry of Health.

2.6 mRNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR
The cells were collected at each time point, and mRNA was extracted and
retro-transcribed using the RNeasy mini kit and the Quantitec reverse
transcription kit (Qiagen), respectively. We performed a Quantitative
Real Time PCR reaction, set up in duplicates using the LightCycler
480 SYBR green master mix (Roche), and the amplification was per-
formed using a LightCycler 480 Real Time PCR instrument (Roche).
The quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCRs) were carried out using dif-
ferent pairs of primers for human and mouse isoforms of Yeats2. Gapdh
was used as control. The primer sequences for all genes are listed in
Supplementary Table S4. Data analysis was performed using the
LightCycler 480 Software(Roche). GAPDH mRNA levels were used
to normalize the amount of mRNA, and ACts were calculated as the
difference between the average GAPDH Ct and the average of Ct for
each gene.

To asses whether genes change their expression significantly in the
qRT—PCR experiments, we used the software package Bayesian
Analysis of Time Series (Angelini et al., 2008). This method is based on
a Bayesian Approach to automatically identify and rank differentially
expressed genes from time-series data according to a Bayes Factor,
where a Bayes Factor less than one means that the gene is differential
express respect to the control.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Construction of a semantic database for
tissue-specific GEPs

One of the main hurdles in using GEPs from public repositories
is the abysmal state of the experiments’ meta—data containing
information on the biological samples and experimental proto—
cols. To select tissue—specific GEPs, we built a semantic data—
base, structured according to a human tissue ontology (Hide
et al., 2003), to retrieve and classify, in a semi—automatic
fashion, microarrays from ArrayExpress (Parkinson et al.,
2005). We assigned to each GEP the correct tissue, according
to the available meta—data, and kept only GEPs with a reliable
annotation. We were thus able to collect 2930 high—quality GEPs
(Affymetrix HG—U113A and HG—U133 Plus 2.0 platforms)
for 30 different tissues (Section 2 and Supplementary Tables SS
and S6).

3.2 Reverse engineering of tissue-specific gene
co-regulation networks

Although Mutual Information has been shown to be a better
alternative to correlation in identifying co—regulated genes
(Basso et al., 2005; Belcastro et al., 2011), we decided to use
the SCC owing to the limited number of GEPs available in the
different tissues. We also decided not to use network pruning
techniques (Faith et al., 2007; Margolin et al., 2006; Soranzo
et al., 2007), as we were not interested to distinguish between
direct and indirect interactions, but rather in how co—regulation
among genes changes across the different tissues.

We first normalized GEPs within each tissue (Rafael et al.,
2003); we then computed the SSC (Hardin et al., 2007) for

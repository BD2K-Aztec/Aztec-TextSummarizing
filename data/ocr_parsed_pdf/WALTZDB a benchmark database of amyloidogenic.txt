Abstract

Summary: Accurate prediction of amyloid—forming amino acid sequences remains an important
challenge. We here present an online database that provides open access to the largest set of ex—
perimentally characterized amyloid forming hexapeptides. To this end, we expanded our previous
set of 280 hexapeptides used to develop the Waltz algorithm with 89 peptides from literature
review and by systematic experimental characterisation of the aggregation of 720 hexapeptides
by transmission electron microscopy, dye binding and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
This brings the total number of experimentally characterized hexapeptides in the WALTZ—DB
database to 1089, of which 244 are annotated as positive for amyloid formation.

Availability and implementation: The WALTZ—DB database is freely available without any
registration requirement at http://waltzdb.switchlab.org.

1 Introduction

Aniyloid formation by proteins is widely recognized as a pathogenic
mechanism in diverse diseases such as Alzheimer Disease and type II
diabetes, but also as a functional mechanism of biological nano-
structure formation, such as the chorion protein that stabilizes insect
eggshell (Fowler et (11., 2006). It has been generally established that
the formation of amyloid fibrils by proteins is nucleated by short ag-
gregation prone segments (APR) of the polypeptide chain, which are
a necessary and sufficient requirement to allow amyloid conversion
of a folded protein (De Baets et (11., 2014). In amyloid, these short
stretches form an intermolecular beta-sheet that runs parallel to the
fiber axis, indicated as the cross-beta structure (Sunde et (11., 1997;
Eisenberg and Jucker, 2012). The sequence that constitute APRs are
usually characterized by a high beta-sheet propensity and hydropho-
bicity and a low net charge (Chiti et (11., 2003). Computational tools

have been developed to predict amylogenic or aggregation propen-
sities of proteins by detecting APRs in polypeptide sequences, re-
viewed elsewhere (Ho et (11., 2006; De Baets et (11., 2014). We earlier
developed the Waltz amyloid prediction algorithm (Maurer—Stroh
et (11., 2010), which is a data-based statistical method that uses a
position-specific scoring matrix for its data representation. As the
quality of statistical methods depends critically on the quantity
(number and sequence diversity of known positive and negative
examples) and quality (confidence of the amyloid status) of the
available data, we decided to increase the available high confidence
learning data by an order of magnitude. This was achieved by
expanding the set of 280 hexapeptides of known amyloid forming
proteins with an additional experimentally verified 720 hexapepti-
des derived from 63 different proteins, combined with an additional
89 peptides derived from literature review, bringing the total nun]-
ber of hexapeptides to 1089.

2 Methods

In order to study the amylogenic properties of hexapeptides, 720
uncharacterized hexapeptides were synthesized by JPT Technologies
GmbH. Peptides were dissolved in 5 0 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4,
0.05% sodium—azide to a final concentration of 1 mM. The peptide
solutions were incubated for 4 weeks at 25°C with shaking at
1000 r.p.m. prior to analysis. Transmission electron microscopy was
applied to gather high contrast images of the peptides in triplicate.
Morphological differences between the peptides were examined
with a JEM—2100 microscope (JEOL, Japan) at 80 keV using nega—
tive staining with uranyl acetate of samples adsorbed on formvar
film coated 400—mesh copper grids (Agar Scientific Ltd., England).
If a peptide did not reveal fibrils by TEM after 4 weeks, the incuba—
tion period was prolonged for at least two weeks. ProteoStat dye
staining was carried out in duplicate on all peptides using a BMG
PolarStar platereader in 96—well format, mixing 30 ul of peptide so—
lution with 70 ul of Proteostat Reagent (ENZO Life Sciences). Upon
interaction with the cross—beta sheet structure of protein aggrega—
tion, the dye shows an increase in fluorescence intensity. Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was measured using a
Bruker Tensor 27 infrared spectrophotometer equipped with a Bio—
ATR II accessory to determine the secondary structure of the peptide
formations. A hexapeptide was identified as an amyloid forming fi—
bril when the FTIR spectrum showed peaks around 1635 cm’1 and/
or 1680 cm71. Additional hexapeptide properties such as WALTZ,
TANGO (Fernandez-Escamilla et 41., 2004) and PASTA scores
(Trovato et al., 2007), hydrophobicity, Chou—Fasman values for
helix and strand propensity (Chou and Fasman, 1974) were calcu—
lated and amyloid structural class (Eisenberg et al., 2009) prediction
and predicted atomic structure models were obtained through com—
parative modeling using the FoldX force field (Schymkowitz et al.,
2005) on the publically available structures of amyloid cores
(Eiscnbcrg et al., 2005; Morris et al., 2013). All peptide data is
stored in a MySQL database and is available through a webserver
built with the Drupal content management system to provide fast
and secure data access. An extended version of these experimental
methods are available in the help page of the website.

3 Results

3.1 Datasets

The database consists of these distinct sets of hexapeptides: (1) FUS:
49 peptides from Fused in sarcoma protein, (2) TDP—43: 94 peptides
from TAR—DNA Protein 4, (3) SOD—1: 30 peptides from Superoxide
Dismutase, (4) Sup35: 205 peptides from the yeast Sup35 prion pro—
tein, (5) Lindquist: 105 hexapeptides from a bioinformatics amyloid
prediction study from the Lindquist group, (6) Functionals: 140 pep—
tides from bacterial and yeast adhesins, (7) Diversity set: collection
of 50 wild type and mutant hexapeptides from different unrelated
disease proteins, (8) Newcores: 47 peptides where the hexapeptides
cores positions 3 and 5 were systematically explored to eliminate
residue bias on these positions, (9) Literature: 200 peptides from the
Amylhex database (Maurer-Stroh, et al., 2010) and 169 hexapepti—
des mined from the literature annotating their amylogenic
properties.

3.2 Online database content

3.2.1 Peptide listing and filtering

The homepage of WALTZ—DB immediately lists a paged table of
the entire database content. The visible columns are the peptide
sequence, source (in—house or literature), morphology decision

(amyloid or non—amyloid), WALTZ and TANGO score. The exten—
sive filter block on the right serves to fine—tune a peptide search.
Filtering can be done on sequence, morphology decision, source,
hydrophobicity, UniProt identifier, PDB identifier, availability
of TEM image or FTIR spectrum and amyloid— or aggregation—
prediction by WALTZ, TANGO and PASTA. At the bottom of the
table, two buttons activate a download of the resulting peptide list
in CSV or Excel format.

3.2.2 Detailed peptide data

Clicking on a peptide sequence opens a peptide—centered page with
detailed annotation and experimental data. When a TEM image was
positive for fiber formation or even a vague impression of fiber for—
mation was present, we show three TEM images, the FTIR spectrum
and the ProteoStat dye staining values. For non—synthetic peptides,
the location of the peptide sequence in the parent protein is colored
red inside the full sequence. On top of the page is a summary includ—
ing FTIR peak values, ProteoStat binding values, WALTZ, TANGO
and PASTA scores, hydrophobicity and Chou—Fasman values for
helix and strand propensity. WALTZ—DB also provides an atomic
structure model for the peptide including information about the pre—
ferred amyloid structure class. The model is a PDB file and can be
downloaded for analysis. At the bottom of each peptide—centered
page there are links to external sites that offer amyloid prediction
tools (De Baets, et al., 2014), so the user can run the peptide through
other predictors and annotation tools.

4 Summary

WALTZ—DB contains 1089 hexapeptides and is currently the largest
database for amyloid morphology annotation. To this end, we ex—
perimentally verified the fiber forming potential for 720 hexapepti—
des through TEM, FTIR and ProteoStat dye staining. We make
available the TEM images and FTIR spectra to allow researchers to
reach independent decisions on the amyloid status of each peptide.
In addition, we provide our own classification based on the presence
of amyloid aggregates by TEM, supported by at least one evidence
for beta—sheet structure by FTIR or Proteostat dye binding. As the
database contains amyloid—positive as well as amyloid—negative sam—
ples, it serves perfectly as a reference set to develop novel prediction
tools.

ABSTRACT

Summary: A useful step for understanding the function of
microRNAs (miRNA) or siRNAs is the detection of their effects
on genome-wide expression profiles. Typically, approaches look
for enrichment of words in the S’UTR sequences of the most
deregulated genes. A number of tools are available for this purpose,
but they require either in-depth computational knowledge, filtered
S’UTR sequences for the genome of interest, or a set of genes
acquired through an arbitrary expression cutoff. To this end, we
have developed SylArray; a web-based resource designed for the
analysis of large-scale expression datasets. It simply requires the
user to submit a sorted list of genes from an expression experiment.
SylArray utilizes curated sets of 3’UTRs to attach sequences to
these genes and then applies the Sylamer algorithm for detection of
miRNA or siRNA signatures in those sequences. An intuitive system
for visualization and interpretation of the small RNA signatures is
included.

Availability: SylArray is written in Perl-CGI, Perl and Java and also
uses the R statistical package. The source-code, database and
web resource are freely available under GNU Public License (GPL).
The web server is freely accessible at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/enright/

1 INTRODUCTION

Non-coding RNAs can have a profound inﬂuence on global mRNA
expression. Small RNAs such as small interfering RNAs and
microRNAs bind to 3’UTRs of mRNAs as a part of the RNA-induced
silencing complex (Tang, 2005; Yazgan and Krebs, 2007). This
binding event stimulates cleavage or degradation of the target
molecule (Lim et (11., 2005). Efﬁciency of silencing is determined by
various factors, the most important one being complementarity to
the target mRNA 3’UTR in a conserved region of 6—8 nt, also called
the ‘seed’ (Grimson et (11., 2007). Analysis of the overrepresentation
of particular seeds in 3’UTRs across an experimental gene set can
be used to detect the inﬂuence of speciﬁc miRNAs and siRNAs on
an expression proﬁle (Farh et (11., 2005).

Recently, the Sylamer algorithm was devised to assess
signiﬁcantly over or under-represented words in 3’UTR sequences
according to a sorted gene list (van Dongen et (11., 2008). The
original algorithm required the user to provide both an ordered

gene list of sufﬁcient size and a matching set of 3’UTR sequences.
In order to make this approach accessible to non-expert users we
have developed SylArray.

SylArray combines a curated database of 3’UTRs with a user-
friendly interface to visualize and detect the inﬂuence of miRNAs or
siRNAs on gene expression proﬁles. Several other tools have been
published with similar aims, such as DIANA-mirExTra (Alexiou
et (11., 2010) and GeneSet2miRNA (Antonov et (11., 2009). SylArray
allows for analysis of larger number of species, containing a premade
database of both ﬁltered 3’UTRs and coding sequences for seven
model organisms. We will continue to update and maintain the
SylArray database with new arrays and platforms as they become
available.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

The starting point for analysis is a sorted gene list obtained by the
user from a gene-expression experiment. The goal of SylArray is to
take this list through the full protocol of miRNA and siRNA seed
enrichment analysis using a simple and intuitive interface.

2.1 Algorithm

SylArray provides a database and a user interface to the Sylamer
algorithm (van Dongen et (11., 2008). It measures signiﬁcance
of word enrichment in 3’UTRs of ranked gene sets based on
hypergeometric P-values.

2.2 Database

The SylArray MySQL database stores curated 3’UTR sequences
and microarray platform information for a large variety of sources.
This was created through the R software environment and the
Bioconductor package biomaRt. Currently, 3’UTR sequences are
available for: Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus,
Xenopus tropicalis, Danio rerio, Drosophila melanogaster and
Caenorhabditis elegans. Sequences were obtained from ENSEMBL
for all available BioMart gene sets of the following id types:
aﬁ‘ymetrix, agilent, illumina, symbol, refseq, unigene, entrez gene
and ensembl. The ﬁill list of gene sets can be found as a
supplementary material on the website. The longest UTR was
selected for each of the Ensembl gene IDs and the sequences were
cleaned of low complexity regions using the DUST algorithm with
default parameters (Morgulis et (11., 2006). The gene sets were then
individually purged of repetitive and redundant sequences by using
the RSAT purge-sequence interface to Vmatch (Thomas-Chollier
et (11., 2008). Purging has been previously shown to be essential for
reliable statistical sequence analysis (Defrance et (11., 2008).

2008). Colored lines represent log of enrichment/depletion P-Value for
miRNA seeds in 3’UTRS, calculated in incremental parts of the submitted
ranked gene list. Genes are sorted by change in expression, from most to least.
Statistically signiﬁcant depletion is observable in the ﬁrst ~800 upregulated
genes (red vertical line from the peak selection tool). Search panel (top right):
allows queries for individual words or known miRNA seeds. Table panel
(bottom): provides information for selected words or miRNAs and allows
access to the lists of genes on either side of the selected peak.

2.3 Web server

The web interface allows the user to upload an ordered gene list
obtained from a microarray or other genome-wide experiment.
Ideally, this list is sorted according to a measure of differential
expression (e.g. log fold-change or t-statistic) and also contains
a sufﬁcient number of genes for statistical power. For each gene
provided, curated 3’UTR sequences are retrieved from the SylArray
database and submitted with the ranked list to Sylamer for analysis.
User can also submit his own premade set of curated FASTA
sequences to the web server for the further analysis. Once analysis is
complete the results are passed to the Java-based Analysis Toolkit.

2.4 Analysis toolkit

The Analysis Toolkit is written in Java (1.5+ compatible) using
the Eclipse framework via Web Start. It runs on all Java-
supporting operating systems (Mac OS X, MS Windows, UNIX
and Linux). The toolkit enables inspection and export of plots for
all standard seed lengths (6mers, 7mers and 8mers) simultaneously
(Fig. 1). Individual miRNAs can be highlighted and their behavior

cross-referenced across different seed lengths. Furthermore, ‘peak
selection’ tool enables access to individual genes that have
contributed to the Sylamer miRNA signal. All the biological entities
are linked to the corresponding databases and easily exported.

3 CONCLUSION

We have created a web server for the analysis, visualization and
interpretation of miRNA and siRNA inﬂuence on gene expression
proﬁles. This tool is both freely available and simple to use. This
resource should allow researchers from a broad area of expertise to
perform fast and accurate detection of small RNA signatures in their
gene-expression datasets.

Abstract

Motivation: To gain insight into how biopolymers fold as quickly as they do, it is useful to deter—
mine which structural elements limit the rate of RNA/protein folding.

Summary: We have created a new web server, FoldNucleus. Using this server, it is possible to cal—
culate the folding nucleus for RNA molecules with known 3D structures—including pseudoknots,
tRNAs, hairpins and ribozymes—and for protein molecules with known 3D structures, as long as
they are smaller than 200 amino acid residues. Researchers can determine and understand which
elements of the structure limit the folding process for various types of RNAs and protein molecules.
Experimental d) values for 21 proteins can be found and compared with those determined by our

method: http://bioinfo.protres.ru/resources/phi_values.htm.

1 Introduction

In theoretical studies of the structure of RNA molecules, the focus
is often on the prediction of secondary and tertiary structures of
RNA and on RNA folding kinetics, which can be described as a
free energy landscape. Because the function of RNA depends on its
conformation, which is analogous to the relationship between the
function and folding structure of proteins, researchers have suc—
cessfully applied methods developed for proteins, such as the (1)
analysis (Matouschek et (11., 1990). In the folding process, the
RNA strand, like a protein globule, passes through numerous
intermediate states able to play a key role in the kinetics of the pro—
cess. The problem of how a biopolymer chooses its native fold be—
tween a huge number of alternative folds is crucial for both RNA
and protein molecules (Levinthal, 1968). Computer experiments
with RNA— and protein—like model chains have shown that all can
reach their lowest—energy fold without an exhaustive search over
all possible folds (Thirumalai and Hyeon, 2005). It is obvious that
not all nucleotides/residues play a decisive role in the RNA/protein
folding. Thus, the knowledge of folding nuclei (a folding nucleus is
the structured part of the molecule in a transient state) makes it

possible to reveal the structural elements that limit the rate of
RNA/protein folding. The theoretical prediction of the RNA nu—
cleotides/residues important for the formation of a folding nucleus
would define the most probable kinetic pathway of folding. This,
in turn, makes it possible to base RNA/protein—engineering efforts
on the experimental detection of the nucleus of folding for an
RNA/protein structure.

It has recently been demonstrated for tRNAASP that secondary
and tertiary interactions are generated simultaneously (Wilkinson
et (11., 2005) but not in a hierarchical process as was supposed for a
long time. This allows us to adopt and apply an algorithm that was
previously developed for the prediction of protein folding nuclei
(Galzitskaya and Finkelstein, 1999) for RNA structures. The calcu—
lated (1) values for tRNA structures agree with the previously ob—
tained experimental data (Pereyaslavets et (11., 2011). According to
the experiment, the nucleotides of the D and T hairpin loops are the
last to become involved in the tRNA tertiary structure (Maglott
et (11., 1999). The purpose of this work is the creation of a server for
the prediction of the structure of folding nuclei for proteins and
RNA molecules, starting from known 3D structures.

2 Algorithm

The algorithm, previously developed for the prediction of protein fold—
ing nuclei, has been successfully adopted and applied to RNA struc—
tures (Pereyaslavets et (11., 2011). The protein or RNA folding/
unfolding process is modeled using the technique of dynamic program—
ming as the reversible unfolding of its native structure. The construc—
tion of a network of protein/RNA unfolding pathways and the point of
thermodynamic equilibrium, estimation of the free energy for proteins/
RNAs and calculation of CI) values are described at http://bioinfo.
protres.ru/foldnucleus/descr/FoldNucleus_RNA.pdf and http://bioinfo.
protres.ru/foldnucleus/descr/FoldNucleus_Protein.pdf.

3 The FoldNucleus server

The FoldNucleus webserver is available at http://bioinfo.protres.ru/
foldnucleus/. For the prediction of (1) values using this server, one
should specify RNA or a protein structure for which the prediction is
to be made. For this purpose, one should specify the corresponding
PDB entry (in a standard 4—symbol format, e.g. the PDB entry is
1evv). For a protein or RNA in which more than one chain (or a pro—
tein—RNA complex) exists in the PDB file to be used, one should also
specify which chain should be used (in the current version, the pro—
gram simulates unfolding of a single—chain protein or RNA molecule).

For example (Fig. 1), if one writes B: in the corresponding field
(region:) (default prediction), the server will use chain B of the pro—
tein or RNA. In addition, there is the option to make a prediction
for a fragment of the chain: e.g. B:120—220 according to the number—
ing of the corresponding PDB entry, which means that the server
will simulate only fragment 120—220 of chain B.

In the current version, the simulation is complete when the size
of a chain link is one nucleotide for short RNA molecules (<30 nu—
cleotide residues), two nucleotides for RNA less than 60 nucleotide
residues and four (or three) nucleotides for larger RNAs. The server
allows the user to choose the fragment length. In the default mode,
the program uses the size of the fragment determined by the equa—
tion N/50, where N is the chain length. The cutoff values for atom—
atom contacts are 6A for heavy atom—heavy atom contacts, 4A for
hydrogen atom—hydrogen atom contacts and 5 for heavy atom—
hydrogen atom contacts. For protein molecules, there is only one
method, the method of contacts. For RNA molecules, the user can
choose one of two methods to calculate the free energy: the method
of contacts or the coarse—grained model adapted from Doholyan’s
model (Ding et (11., 2008). The predictions of CI) values are made
upon consideration of mutations of all residues to glycine or alanine
residues. In the case of RNA, all nucleotides will be deleted similar

4 Implementation

The server was used to determine the folding nuclei for 21 proteins. A
comparison of the calculation results with the experimental data
shows that the model provides good @—value predictions for protein
structures determined by X—ray analysis with consideration of hydro—
gen atoms and, less successfully, for structures determined by nuclear
magnetic resonance (see Table 1 at http://bioinfo.protres.ru/foldnu—
cleus/descr/FoldNucleus_Protein.pdf). For protein structures, we con—
sider all possible versions for the prediction of folding nuclei. They are
as follows. The size of a link is five residues, and the link has the min—
imum size. Only the optimal folding nucleus and the entire ensemble
of folding nuclei without hydrogen atoms and with hydrogen atoms
are taken into account. All of these versions are listed in Table 1. One
can see that the correlation is the best for the case when we consider
the entire ensemble of folding nuclei with hydrogen atoms. When we
consider the minimum size of a link, the correlation coefficient for 12
proteins is 0.56 i 0.08. In the case in which the size of a link is five
residues, the correlation coefficient is 0.58 i 0.09.

The tertiary unfolding transition state of unmodified yeast
tRNAPhe has been studied (Maglott et (11., 1999). The authors con—
cluded that the D/T—loop junction is formed last during the tRNAPhe
folding. The calculated (1) values for tRNA structures (N150 PDB
structures) agree with the previously obtained experimental data.
According to the experiment, the nucleotides of the D and T hairpin
loops are the last to be involved in the tRNA tertiary structure. One
of the advantages of our method is that it allows us to calculate the
energy and folding nucleus in the structures with nontrivial RNA
motifs, such as pseudoknots and tRNAs, if their spatial structures
are in the PDB or NDB databases (see Tables 2 and 3 at http://bio—
info.protres.ru/foldnucleus/descr/FoldNucleus_RNA.pdf).

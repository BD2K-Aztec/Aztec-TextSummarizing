ABSTRACT

Summary: We present RNASquUl R package, a graphical user inter-
face (GUI) for the identification of differentially expressed genes across
multiple biological conditions. This R package includes some well-
known RNA-Seq tools, available at www.bioconductor.org.
RNASquUl package is not just a collection of some known methods
and functions, but it is designed to guide the user during the entire
analysis process. RNASquUl package is mainly addressed to those
users who have little experience with command-line software.
Therefore, thanks to RNASquUl, they can conduct analogous ana-
lyses using this simple graphical interface. Moreover, RNASquUl is
also helpful for those who are expert R-users because it speeds up the
usage of the included RNASeq methods drastically.

Availability and implementation: RNASquUl package needs the
RGTK2 graphical library to run. This package is open source and is
freely available under General Public License at http://bioinfo.na.iac.

1 INTRODUCTION

There is a plethora of RNA-Seq data analysis tools available to
study the difference of the gene expression across multiple bio-
logical conditions; see Soneson and Delorenzi (2013) for a
review. Generally, a complete analysis requires carrying out sev-
eral steps, using different methods and comparing their outputs
to obtain more reliable and less biased results. RNASquUI is a
tool that facilitates and speeds up the exploration of the RNA-
Seq data, the usage of several RNA-Seq methods and the com-
parison of different results. Moreover, RNASquUI is a modu-
lar software. This gives the user the possibility to customize the
software for a speciﬁc type of study.

1.1 Other GUIs and objectives of RNASquUI

Several bioinformatics tools (Angelini et al., 2008; Lohse et al.,
2012; Pramana et al., 2013; Sanges et al., 2007; Wettenhall and
Smyth, 2004; Wettenhall et al., 2006) have been implemented as
user-friendly graphical interfaces to provide point-and-click
access to sophisticated data analysis. Among them,
RNASquUI has a clear focus on the analysis of RNA-seq
data. Analogous focus, but with different functionalities, is

present in Lohse et a]. (2012). More recently, Sanges et al.
(2007) has been extended to RNA-Seq data analysis as well.
With respect to these interfaces, RNASquUI has some over-
laps, but also several unique features to be considered a useful
and valid alternative.

The design of RNASquUI main interface is inspired to that
one presented in Angelini et al. (2008). It tries to be intuitive and to
guide the user through the RNA-Seq data analysis. To meet this
goal, the main interface (described in detail in the rest of the art-
icle) is organized into several different sections/interfaces (Fig. 1),
each of them devoted to a specific stage of the analysis. Usability is
enhanced thanks to the presence of numerous explanatory Vi-
gnettes. Moreover, RNASquUI is designed to facilitate the ex-
tensibility, thanks to its software development organization. In
fact, it is extremely easy to add new buttons that call new func-
tionalities. Therefore, a user can customize RNASquUI inter-
faces f or his own purposes and beneﬁts by adding the methods he
needs mostly (for more details see How to customize RNASqu UI.‘
Adding a new button in just three steps of the user manual).

2 STRUCTURE OF RNASEQGUI MAIN INTERFACE

RNASquUI R package was implemented by following and ex-
panding the idea presented in Villa-Vialaneix and Leroux (2013)
and using the RGTK2 graphical library (Lawrence and Temple
Lang, 2010). Its main interface is divided into ﬁve sections (Fig. 1).
Each section corresponds to a particular step of the RNA-Seq
data analysis work-ﬂow and includes one or more graphical
interfaces. Inside each interface, there are several available func-
tions (also called methods). Each function takes speciﬁc inputs that
can be numeric ones, strings or both and produces one or more
outputs that can be plots, text files or both. Each analysis starts by
creating or retrieving a speciﬁc project. Despite the fact that each
function can be executed by simply clicking the corresponding
button, for each project a detailed history of all performed steps
is automatically saved in a report ﬁle.

In the following, we brieﬂy describe all sections of
RNASquUI main interface.

2.1 Bam exploration section

In the ﬁrst section of RNASquUI main interface, we ﬁnd the
Barn Exploration Interface that can be easily called by clicking
the corresponding button (Fig. 1). This interface includes five
different methods to explore the alignment ﬁles (in barn
format), such as Read Counts, Mean Quality of the Reads, Per
Base Quality of Reads, Reads Per Chromosome, Nucleotide
Frequencies. Each of these functions takes as input a folder con-
taining all the barn files that the user wants to explore. Usually,

Fig. 1. RNASquUI main interface. It appears on the screen after typing
1ibrary(RNASquUI) and RNASquUIO in an R environment

each bam ﬁle corresponds to a sample. This section is important
to discover possible errors that may have occurred either during
the alignment step or during the experimental steps (i.e. sequen-
cing, PCR, extraction of RNA-sequences).

2.2 Count section

In the second section of RNASquUI, we ﬁnd the Read Count
Interface that gives the possibility to perform the quantification
process against an annotation file in gene transfer format (GTF)
format. It works similarly to htseq—count (www.huber.embl.de/
users/anders/HTSeq). The Count Reads button, inside this
interface, calls summarizeOverlaps function from the pack-
age GenomicRanges (Lawrence et al., 2013). It can be used in
three different modes (Union, IntersectionStrict and
IntersectionNotEmpty) and returns a table of counts,
where the ﬁrst column represents the gene names, while the re-
maining columns correspond to the names of the barn ﬁles. Rows
report the number of reads that have hit a particular gene in the
given sample. Read counting can be a computationally expensive
process, especially for large experiments with several samples and
big alignment files. The R environment is not optimized for
this particular task. Therefore, this procedure makes use of
bplapply function of the BiocParallel package (Morgan
et al., 2014) to parallelize the code to reduce the execution time.

2.3 Pre-analysis section

In the third section of RNASquUI, there are two interfaces:
Data Exploration Interface and Normalization Interface. Both
interfaces take an input count ﬁle that must be tab-delimited
as those provided by Count Reads function as output, with

rows representing genes names and the columns representing
the samples.

Data Exploration Interface: This interface includes 12 meth-
ods, such as Plot Pairs of Counts, Plot all Counts, Count Distr,
Density, MDPlot, MeanVarPlot, Heatmap, Principal
Component Analysis (PCA), PCA3D, Component Histogram,
QplotHistogram and Qplot Density. This interface uses several
functions deﬁned in Risso et al. (2011), and it is crucial to ﬁnd
out possible biases that could affect the RNASeq-experiment and
provide useful diagnostic ﬁgures to decide whether a normaliza-
tion procedure is needed.

Normalization Interface: This interface includes four normal-
ization procedures, such as reads per kilobase per million
mapped reads (RPKM) (Mortazavi et al., 2008), Upper
Quartile (Bullard et al., 2010), trimmed mean of M-Values
(TMM) (Robinson and Oshlack, 2010), Full Quantile (Bolstad
et al., 2003; Smyth, 2005).

2.4 Data analysis section

This section is the core of RNASquUI and contains the Data
Analysis Interface. This interface includes ﬁve different statistical
methods to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes, such as
edgeR (McCarthy et al., 2012; Robinson et al., 2007, 2008, 2010),
DESeq, DESeq2 (Anders and Huber, 2010), NOISeq (Tarazona
et al., 2011), baySeq (Hardcastle and Kelly, 2010). Each method
takes an input count ﬁle and returns two text ﬁles and one or
more plots. The ﬁrst text file shows the results of the chosen
method, whereas the second text ﬁle shows the differentially ex-
pressed genes only.

2.5 Post—analysis section

This section includes two interfaces: Result Inspection Interface
and Result Comparison Interface.

Result Inspection Interface: This interface includes the possibility
to generate volcano plots, fold change plots and histograms of
the false discovery rates (FDRs) or P—Values for each method for
the user to explore the results. It is also possible to display a
speciﬁc gene of interest inside the volcano or the fold change
plot. All generated plots are automatically saved in pdf format.
Result Comparison Interface: This interface includes the possibil-
ity to generate Venn diagrams and text files that show those
genes that have been identiﬁed as differentially expressed by
the methods used in the Data analysis section.

3 USAGE EXAMPLE

In this usage example, we start the analysis of the RNASeq data
from alignment ﬁles and we compare the results of edgeR,
DESeq and NOISeq among them. We analysed the dataset pub-
lished by Brooks et al. (2011) and used in Anders et al. (2013) as
a real data working example. We selected the chromosome 2L
only to reduce the execution time. Aligned data (bam ﬁles) are
available at http://bioinfo.na.iac.cnr.it/RNASquUI/Example.
We analysed the expression of 2986 genes belonging to 2L
chromosome. The methods found 128, 148, 102 DE genes, re-
spectively. The intersection of these three gene sets contains 86
genes. Hence, all the three methods used found 86 DE genes in
common (for more details, see the Supplementary data).

4 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS

RNASquUI is an R package that allows the quick usage of
several methods to identify the differentially expressed genes
from RNASeq experiments. In future, we will include new meth-
ods, new normalization procedures, the possibility to deﬁne more
complex experimental designs, the pathway analysis and
the Gene Ontology.

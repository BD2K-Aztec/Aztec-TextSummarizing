ABSTRACT

Motivation: Computer Aided Identification systems provide users
with the resources to relate morpho-anatomic observations with
taxa names and to subsequently access other knowledge about the
organisms. They have the ability to manage descriptive data and
make identifications through interactive keys. They are essential for
both authors and users of biodiversity information. Xper2 version 2.0
is one of the most user-friendly tools in its category and provides a
complete environment dedicated to taxonomic management.
Availability: Xper2 software can be freely downloaded at http://lis-
upmc.snv.jussieu.fr/lis/?q=en/resources/softwares/xper2

1 INTRODUCTION

Linnaeus wrote that naming is the ﬁrst stage of knowledge. Indeed,
names of taxa are the main access keys to biological information
(Polaszek, 2005). They link the real world of living organisms
and the conceptual world proposed by systematists through the
description and characterization of taxa. Identifying life forms is
crucial for all activities related to biology and their taxonomic
descriptions are more than necessary in the study of Biodiversity
(Godfray, 2002; Lebbe and Vignes, 1991, 1998). Systematists
inventory, study and structure biological diversity as precisely
as possible (Matile et (11., 1987). All this information may be
summarized into knowledge bases to perform identiﬁcation of
specimens for new inventories and monitoring surveys, phylogenetic
analyses, as well as biogeographic and ecological studies. A
signiﬁcant increase of this kind of digitized information should be
expected in a near future. The deep social and scientiﬁc impact
of web 2.0 stimulates sharing of digital data and proposals of
‘cybertaxonomy’ projects to study global biodiversity and climate
changes. The generalization and the integration of knowledge-base
management systems into current taxonomic work may be the next
revolution in taxonomy. International projects are already opening
the way of this new, delocalized taxonomy.

2 WHAT IS XPER2?

Xper2 is a management system for storage, editing, analysis and
on-line distribution of descriptive data. It dynamically creates
interactive keys for identifying specimens (Fig. l). Xper2 does

not require any special computer skills. It is written in Java and
available on WindowsTM MacTM or Linux in French, English or
Spanish versions. It has a user-friendly and intuitive interface aimed
at professional taxonomists as well as naturalists who merely want
to identify specimens using a ready-made application. Xper2 ’s users
are taxonomists, teachers, fauna and ﬂora experts (for biodiversity
monitoring or survey) and ecologists. Formalization of knowledge
is the main difﬁculty for taxonomists. How to structure and organize
different types of data? How to keep the scientiﬁc sources of
the data in order to maintain traceability? Xper2 is designed to
manage this rich and heterogeneous information. Divided into four
modules, Xper2 allows taxonomists to either access the descriptive
environment, the taxonomic description module, the management
tools or the free access key:

(1) descriptive model: creation and editing of a standardized
description (structured into characters, states, groups and
logical dependencies);

(2) taxonomic editor: characteristics of the taxon, i.e. its name,
descriptions, comments and pictures;

(3) management tools (see Section 3.4); and

(4) free access key: creation of interactive identiﬁcation keys
(IIK).

3 NEW FUNCTIONALITIES

3.1 Import/export structural descriptive data

Many international research programs focus on the establishment
of standard formats for data and knowledge exchange. Xper2
implements the structured descriptive data (Hagedorn et al, 2006),
the exchange format for taxonomic descriptions that has emerged
from the work of the Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG,
http://www.tdwg.org, formerly known as taxonomic database
working group). Xper2 can seamless import/export data from/to
SDD, following international recommendations.

3.2 Nexus export

Xper2 extends the descriptive morpho-anatomic work and the
taxonomic expertise of taxonomists into phylogenetic studies. A
knowledge base can be exported in nexus format and directly be
run in most phylogeny programs such as PAUP*.

3.3 HTML export

Xper2 provides users with a user-friendly tool to instantly format
the knowledge base in a set of HTML ﬁles according to a deﬁned
cascading style sheet provided by the application. These pages
include a form for each taxon displaying its complete description,
pictures and any additional comments. By this way, monographies
can be easily computed and published in order to serve the entire
community. As an example, a website on monitor lizards (http://lis-
upmc.snv.jussieu.fr/varanID) has been created by a naturalist group
from the Paris Museum.

3.4 An accurate knowledge representation and more
tools to analyze descriptive data

Xper2 offers solutions to control and prevent inconsistencies via a
check base function. Furthermore, analyzing descriptive data is one
of the most important taxonomists’ tasks and Xper2 gives tools to
carry it out:

0 Xper2 is able to manage uncertainty by selecting several
descriptor-states and using logical operators (logical AND,
logical XOR, logical NOT).

0 Mismatch threshold: one can deﬁne a different threshold
according to his expertise level when performing identiﬁcation.

0 Instant comparison of all taxa in a matrix summarizing
descriptions.

4 FORTHCOMING DEVELOPMENTS

Management of extended descriptor types are under development.
This includes management of numerical data, hierarchical or
structured descriptor states, computed values, or any other user-
declared type (Chalubert and Vignes, 2006). Associated tools
allowing writing descriptions or diagnoses in natural language or
proposing different kinds of similarity index among taxa will be
implemented in ﬁiture versions.

5 AVAILABILITY

Xper2 is a versatile tool for editing and using taxonomic
descriptions. It is free of charge and can be downloaded at http://lis-
upmc. snv.jussieu.fr/lis/?q=en/resources/softwares/xper2. A mailing-
list facility provides users with any help or advice that may
be needed. Authors choose how they want to use or publish
their knowledge base: distributed on CD (i.e. Mascarene Corals
identiﬁcation tool, Conruyt et al., 2000) or online publication
(e.g. XperBotanica—a project to identify the ﬂora of France,
http://lis-upmc.snv.jussieu.fr/xperbotanica).

6 CONCLUSION

Many international projects such as GBIF, EDIT, BIOTA, Catalogue
of Life, Encyclopedia of Life, Key2Nature, etc. have a common
purpose: sharing knowledge and providing free web access to
Biodiversity Information (Bisby et al., 2002; Ramsey and Janzen,
2002; Tillier and Roberts, 2006). In this context of collaborative
work, Xper2 ﬁts with current taxonomists’ practices and gathers
functionalities to perform a suitable e—taxonomy!

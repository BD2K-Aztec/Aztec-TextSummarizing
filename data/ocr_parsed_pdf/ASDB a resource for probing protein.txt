Abstract

Summary: Identifying chemical probes or seeking scaffolds for a specific biological target is im—
portant for protein function studies. Therefore, we create the Annotated Scaffold Database (ASDB),
a computer—readable and systematic target—annotated scaffold database, to serve such needs. The
scaffolds in ASDB were derived from public databases including ChEMBL, DrugBank and TCMSP,
with a scaffold—based classification approach. Each scaffold was assigned with an InCthey as its
unique identifier, energy—minimized 3D conformations, and other calculated properties. A scaffold
is also associated with drugs, natural products, drug targets and medical indications. The database
can be retrieved through text or structure query tools. ASDB collects 333 601 scaffolds, which are
associated with 4368 targets. The scaffolds consist of 3032 scaffolds derived from drugs and 5163
scaffolds derived from natural products. For given scaffolds, scaffold—target networks can be gener—
ated from the database to demonstrate the relations of scaffolds and targets.

Availability and implementation: ASDB is freely available at http://www.rcdd.org.cn/asdb/with the

major web browsers.

1 Introduction

Medicinal chemists, phytochemists and chemical biologists are seek—
ing novel chemical scaffolds or probes for a specific biological target
(mainly a protein). Therefore, great attention has been paid in de—
veloping methods and resources to discover new chemical scaffolds
or probes associated with biological targets. In the high—throughput
synthesis and screening campaigns, privileged scaffolds were identi—
fied (Welsch et (11., 2010) to establish structure activity relations
(SAR) for further property and activity optimizations. Small chem—
ical scaffolds have been studied for many years (Schuffenhauer and
Varin, 2011; Xu, 2002), and resulted in many scaffold—oriented
techniques including scaffold hopping (Sun et (11., 2012), virtual
screening (Ertl, 2014), and diversity—oriented synthesis (Galloway

et (11., 2010). Bemis and Murcko are the pioneers in chemical scaf—
fold concept (Bemis and Murcko, 1996). Xu (2002) used the scaf—
fold concept to classify compounds and measure molecular
diversity. Bajorath and colleagues studied scaffolds and activity cliffs
relations (Hu and Bajorath, 2010), scaffolds and activities (Hu and
Bajorath, 2011).

These scaffold related studies generated new needs for chemical
scaffold resources. Shen and coworkers developed a scaffold data—
base for scaffold hopping studies (Yan et (11., 2009). To systematic—
ally study current chemical scaffolds associated with biological
targets, we created an annotated scaffold data base (ASDB). ASDB
collects chemical scaffolds derived from the major databases for me—
dicinal chemistry or chemical biology. The scaffolds have been

annotated with their known targets, drugs, natural product sources
and medical indications. ASDB is also cross—linked with the
ChEMBL (Gaulton et (11., 2012), DrugBank (Law at 111., 2014),
TCMSP (Ru et (11., 2014) and UniProt (Bateman et (11., 2015) data—
bases, and can be retrieved through structural query or text query
tools. To demonstrate scaffold—target and scaffold—scaffold relations,
ASDB provides a network viewing tool to present the database
search hits.

2 Methods

2.1 Data and the protocol for deriving chemical
scaffolds

Raw data were extracted from the ChEMBL_20 (Gaulton et (11.,
2012) (bioactive compounds), DrugBank (Law at 111., 2014) (drugs)
and TCMSP (Ru et (11., 2014) (natural products) databases. The raw
data were processed with the following protocol: (i) removing coun—
ter ion moieties; (ii) filtering compounds in ChEMBL_20 for activity
(IC50, K,, Kd) thresholds that were greater than 10 MM; (iii) deriving
scaffolds with the scaffold classification approach; and finally, (iv)
converting the scaffold data into InChI, InChIKey (scaffold identi—
fier), SMILES, and MOL2 formats by means of the OpenBabel pro—
gram (O’Boyle et (11., 2011). The protocol was written in the Golang
language. The ﬂowchart of the process is depicted in Figure 1.

2.2 Web—based database implementation

ASDB is a relational database implemented in MySQL technology
and, can be accessed through a web browser using the browser/ser—
ver framework, and the ChemDoodle web component (web.chem
doodle.com/) as a 2D molecule editor and 3D chemical structure
viewer. Four types of queries (structure query, substructure query,
2D similarity and 3D similarity query) are provided for a user to ac—
cess the ASDB. An online scaffold—target network can be dynamic—
ally generated and viewed in ASDB using D3.js (d3js.org/).
Technologies for creating ASDB are summarized in Supplementary
Table S1.

3 Results and discussion

3.1 ASDB statistics

Currently, ASDB collects 333 601 scaffolds, which are associated
with 4368 targets and, contains 491 208 scaffold—target relations.
3032 scaffolds come from drugs; 5163 scaffolds come from natural
products. 641 scaffolds were derived from natural products, and ex—
perimentally validated as bioactive scaffolds. 174 of the 641 scaf—
folds were associated with drugs. 4546 natural product associated
scaffolds are not annotated with any bioactivity or biological target.
These scaffolds are unexplored chemical diversity for chemical biol—
ogy or medicinal chemistry studies (Supplementary Fig. S1A.). 38%
of targets are associated with 0—5 scaffolds. 77% of targets are asso—
ciated with 0—50 scaffolds. 93% scaffolds are associated with less
than five targets (Supplementary Fig. S1 C). This data indicates that
most targets are biologically unexplored and most scaffolds are ei—
ther selective or biologically unexplored. 23% targets are associated
with 50—500+ scaffolds suggesting these targets have been signifi—
cantly explored, and the related scaffolds can be privileged chemo—
types (Xu et (11., 2013) (Supplementary Fig. S1B).

3.2 Web interface
ASDB can be accessed through web browsers. The ‘Search’ button
at the menu bar provides two options for a user to access ASDB

scaffolds. The first option is the text query, which can be used to
search the target name, UniProt ID or ChEMBL ID. The second op—
tion is structure query, which allows a user to conduct full structure
search, substructure searches, and 2D or 3D similarity searches.
Users can draw a structural query with ChemDoodle, set hit criteria,
and get combined search hits. There is a limit to avoid an undesir—
able amount of hits. The ‘Service’ button at the menu bar can dis—
play a scaffold—target network based upon your scaffold search
results. The scaffold—target network is associated with a scaffold list
or target list (UniProt IDs or CHEMBL IDs).

3.3 Case studies
Two case studies for target fishing and new scaffold exploring using
ASDB are provided in Supplementary materials.

4 Conclusions

Chemical scaffold concept is extensively studied, although it is still
controversial. ASDB provides a platform for scientists to explore
novel scaffolds or chemical probes for pharmaceutical innovations
and chemical biology studies. The scaffold concept is also related to
fragment—based drug discovery (FBDD). Chemical scaffolds or frag—
ments are associated with biological targets per se, and deserve to
have a systemic resource for further explorations.

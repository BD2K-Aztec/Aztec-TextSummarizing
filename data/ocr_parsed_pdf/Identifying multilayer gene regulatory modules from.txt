ABSTRACT

Motivation: Eukaryotic gene expression (GE) is subjected to precisely
coordinated multi-Iayer controls, across the levels of epigenetic,
transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations. Recently, the
emerging multi-dimensional genomic dataset has provided unprece-
dented opportunities to study the cross-layer regulatory interplay. In
these datasets, the same set of samples is profiled on several layers of
genomic activities, e.g. copy number variation (CNV), DNA methylation
(DM), GE and microRNA expression (ME). However, suitable analysis
methods for such data are currently sparse.

Results: In this article, we introduced a sparse Multi-Block Partial
Least Squares (sMBPLS) regression method to identify multi-
dimensional regulatory modules from this new type of data. A
multi-dimensional regulatory module contains sets of regulatory fac-
tors from different layers that are likely to jointly contribute to a local
‘gene expression factory’. We demonstrated the performance of our
method on the simulated data as well as on The Cancer Genomic
Atlas Ovarian Cancer datasets including the CNV, DM, ME and GE
data measured on 230 samples. We showed that majority of identiﬁed
modules have significant functional and transcriptional enrichment,
higher than that observed in modules identified using only a single
type of genomic data. Our network analysis of the modules revealed
that the CNV, DM and microRNA can have coupled impact on expres-
sion of important oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.

1 INTRODUCTION

Eukaryotic gene expression (GE) is a complex process controlled
at multiple levels, including epigenetic, transcriptional and
post-transcriptional regulation. Dynamic and precise coordin-
ation of these regulatory processes is essential to maximize the
efﬁciency and speciﬁcity in GE. Recent studies support the View

that, rather than a simple ‘step-by-step’ production line, the GE
machine is governed by multiple, complex and extensively
coupled networks (Maniatis and Reed, 2002; Moore, 2005;
Orphanides and Reinberg, 2002).

The development of high-throughput genomic technologies
has enabled researchers to obtain a global View of gene regula-
tion. Microarray and sequencing technologies can not only meas-
ure genome-wide GE levels but also proﬁle DNA modifications
(e.g. CNV [copy number variation]), epigenetic regulation
(e.g. DNA methylation [DM] and histone modiﬁcations) and
post-transcriptional regulation (e.g. microRNA expression
[ME]). However, most genome-wide studies have been restricted
to only one aspect of regulation such as studies based on GE
proﬁles (Alter et al., 2000; Omberg et al., 2007; Tamayo et al.,
2007). Recently, a new type of large-scale multi-dimensional gen-
omic dataset has been gaining in popularity. In these datasets,
the same set of samples is proﬁled on several layers of genomic
activity, e.g. CNV, DM, GE and ME. The Cancer Genomic
Atlas (TCGA) (McLendon et al., 2008) project and the NCI60
(Shoemaker, 2006) project provide this type of comprehensive
genomic characterization for a cohort of cancer samples and
cancer cell lines, respectively. Multi-dimensional datasets provide
unprecedented opportunities to discover connections between the
different layers of GE regulation.

The emerging large-scale multi-dimensional genomic data calls
for novel computational methods. In fact, as the cost of sequen-
cing falls, multi-dimensional characterization of samples will
soon become standard practice. However, suitable analysis meth-
ods are currently sparse. In particular, since the different types of
genomic data have different scales and units, we cannot simply
aggregate them for analysis. Previous relevant effort has mostly
focused on two-dimensional genomic datasets. For example,
various eQTL methods can jointly analyze single-nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) and GE data to identify regulatory SNPs
(Zhang et al., 2010); multivariate regression can correlate GE
and transcription factor (TF) binding data to associate TFs
with their target genes (Gao et al., 2004); and the Ping-Pong
algorithm integrates GE and drugiresponse data (Kutalik
et al., 2008). Recently, several methods have been developed to
analyze genomic datasets with more than two dimensions. For

example, the multivariate model developed by Mankoo et al.
(2011) and the sparse regression method proposed by Witten
and Tibshirani (2009), both can learn multi-dimensional genomic

data in the supervised manner. Another relevant method,
cMonkey, is a multi-species biclustering method that was applied
to analyze GE matrices from different species (Waltman et al.,
2010). In addition, there have been a series of multiple kernel learn-
ing methods designed for integrating heterogeneous genomic data
(Alpaydin, 2011; Hamid et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2010). These meth-
ods combine multiple kernels (each of which is transformed from a
data type) into a single kernel, known as kernel fusion, which is
then used for prediction, regression or feature selection.

In this article, we used a novel approach for supervised module
discovery from R-dimensional genomic data (R 3 3), a topic that
was not covered by the aforementioned methods. In particular,
we aim to identify multi-dimensional gene regulatory modules,
which from R—dimensional genomic data (R 3 3). In this appli-
cation, a regulatory module contains sets of regulatory factors
from different layers that are likely to contribute jointly to a local
‘gene expression factory’. Without losing generality, assume that
we are given a four-dimensional dataset consisting of GE, copy
number variation (CNV), DNA methylation (DM) and
microRNA expression (ME) proﬁles measured on the same K
samples (Figure 1). Considering CNV, DM and ME as the input
variables and GE as the response variable, we represent this
dataset as four matrices: X,- e IRKXN', where i = 1, 2, 3 and
Y e IRKXM. In each matrix the rows correspond to the same sam-
ples. The columns of the matrices correspond to measurements
of different types. We aim to identify subsets of the three types of
variables (CNV, DM and ME) that jointly explain the expression
of a subset of genes, in all or a subset of the samples. The union
of these four subsets of the different types of variables are termed
a ‘Multi-Dimensional Regulatory Module (MDRM)’ (Figure 1).
In our matrix representation, such a module consists of k rows,
and n,- (i: 1, 2, 3) and m columns for the CNV, DM, ME and
GE data. This approach captures the association between differ-
ent types of variables (CNViDMiME) in terms of their joint
impact on GE and facilitates the reconstruction of the regulatory
network across different layers.

To identify multi-dimensional regulatory modules, we intro-
duced a sparse Multi-Block Partial Least Squares (sMBPLS)
regression method. Partial least squares (PLS) is a class of re-
gression methods for ﬁnding the fundamental relations between
an input matrix (X) and a response matrix (Y). Instead of finding
hyperplane of maximum variance between the input and re-
sponse variables, it finds a linear regression model by projecting
both variables to a new space (Boulesteix and Strimmer, 2007;
Fornell and Bookstein, 1982; Le Cao et al., 2008; Liu and
Rayens, 2007; Tenenhaus et al., 2005). MBPLS method is an
expansion of the PLS for the regression analysis of input

variables that are blocked into multiple subsections (Wangen
and Kowalski, 1988; Wold et al., 1987). MBPLS was initially
developed for the chemometrics analysis and has been rarely
applied to Bioinformatics (Hwang et al., 2004; Li and Chan,
2009). The multi-dimensional genomic data provide a new op-
portunity for its application. In this article, we further expanded
the MBPLS method by imposing sparse constraints to identify
multi-dimensional modules. In particular, we imposed sparse
constraints in both genomic variables and the sample dimen-
sions. Different from the original MBPLS whose objective is
the regression analysis of the whole data blocks, the sMBPLS
aims to decompose the whole data blocks into a collection of
smaller building blocksiMDRMs.

We demonstrated the performance of our method on both
simulated data and the multi-dimensional TCGA datasets. The
simulation study showed that the sMBPLS method can accur-
ately identify embedded multi-dimensional modules and remark-
ably outperforms the non-sparse approach. We applied sMBPLS
method to a suite of TCGA data including the CNV, DM, ME
and GE data on 230 ovarian cancer samples. We showed that
majority of identiﬁed modules have significant functional and
transcriptional enrichment, higher than that observed in modules
identiﬁed using only a single type of genomic data. Our network
analysis of the modules revealed that the multi-dimensional gen-
omic components are tightly connected and the CNV, DM and
microRNA can have combinatorial impact on expression of
important oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Finally, we
compared our sMBPLS approach to the commonly used
approach in which all input data blocks were aggregated into a
single block for module discovery. We found that almost half of
modules from the single-block approach are not multi-
dimensional, demonstrating the importance of our ‘multi-block’
approach in capturing functional relationships of variables from
multiple dimensions.

2 METHODS

2.1 Deﬁnition of the MDRM

Given three input blocks X1,X2,X3 and a response block Y, a
multi-dimensional module is deﬁned by satisfying the criterion “the pro-
ﬁles extracted from n,- columns across k rows ofX,- (i: 1, 2, 3) has strong
association with (or has similar and coherent pattern with) those from m
columns across the same k rows of Y” (Fig. 1). Such association between
two submatrices from X ,- and Y can be measured by the covariance of
their ‘summary vectors’. The coincidence of these associations appearing
in the same k samples establishes the strong signals that multiple types of
input variables explain the response variables. Such distinct covariance
structure in subspaces of multiple blocks can be identiﬁed by the sparse
version of the MBPLS regression framework.

2.2 Objective function

We ﬁrst introduce the covariance function of measuring the association
between two matrices. Let X and Y be input and response matrices on the
same K samples, respectively. To summarize columns of a matrix X, we
introduce a ‘summary’ vector t which is a linear combination of all col-
umns of X, i.e. t: X w (w being the weights of input variables/columns).
Similarly, u is a summary vector of Y columns, i.e. u: Yq (q being the
weights of response variable/columns). Thus, the larger the covariance of

two summary vectors t and u are, the more similar two matrices look like
and the higher the association of two matrices is (Figure 2A). This asso-
ciation measure can be extended to multiple blocks of input variables.

Consider three input blocks X ,- e [RKXNI (where i=1, 2, 3), each of
which contains a set of N,- centered (zero-mean) input variables on the
same K samples, and let Y e [RKXM be the response data with M centered
variables on the same K samples (Figure 2B). We used the weighted sum
t = 2:1 bit,- of ‘summary vectors’ t,- = X,-w,- (i: 1, 2, 3) of the three sets
of input variables. The block weights b1,b2,b3 >0 indicate the contribu-
tion of each data block to the covariance structure of the input and
response data. Therefore, the covariance between t and u = Y q measures
the association between three input data blocks and a response data
block. The maximization of covariance between t and u can reveal the
associations between from X1,X2,X3 and Y, which lead to the discovery
of a multi-dimensional module (Figure 2B). The problem is formally
expressed as follows:

3
max cov (t,u) with t,- = X,-w,-, u = Yq, and t = Zbiti (1)
i:1

subject to H w,- ||2= 1, H q “2: 1, and H b “2: 1. This is also the objective
of the MBPLS regression problem (Wangen and Kowalski, 1988) which
seeks to best explain the covariance structure between multiple groups of
input variables and response variables. t,- and u are also called the ‘latent
variables’ of the ilh block X ,- and block Y, respectively, and w,- and q are
their associated ‘loading vectors’.

Although the solution to this objective can identify a multi-
dimensional module by selecting those variables and samples with large

     

  

absolute values from w,—,q,t, such module may not be the most distinct. As
shown in our simulation study, the MBPLS regression approach often
fails to identify distinct association signals of coherent structures. To
address this problem, we added the sparsity penalties to the above
objective.

2.3 Sparsity penalization

Sparsity penalization has recently attracted intense interest in regression
analysis (Friedman, 2008), variable selection (Chun and Keles, 2010; Le
Cao et al., 2008), matrix factorization (Kim and Park, 2007; Shen and
Huang, 2008) and module discovery. The concept of sparsity (also called
sparse coding in the literature) refers to a representational scheme
(e.g. loading vector) where only a few elements are effectively used to
represent data. Such sparsity is attractive from a data analysis viewpoint
and makes representational scheme easy to interpret, as it selects the
important elements and discards the rest. In effect, this implies most
elements taking values close to zero while only few take signiﬁcantly
non-zero values. In our sparse version of the MBPLS problem, we
searched the sparse representations of loading vectors whose non-zero
elements can form a multi-dimensional module. It is achieved by
adding sparsity penalties or regularizations to the optimization problem.
Speciﬁcally, we adopted the widely used ‘lasso penalization’ (Tibshirani,
1996), which has been successfully applied in many ﬁelds. Let x be the
vector to be computed in the optimization problem. The lasso regular-
ization of x, denoted P)‘(X) = Zipmxi) = Z2A|xil can be added to en-
force sparsity on the solution of x. Our maximization problem becomes

Fig. 2. Illustration of (A) the covariance function for measuring the association of two matrices and (B) the problem formulation of multi-dimensional
module discovery. To search a multi-dimensional module, columns of each block are represented by a ‘summary’ vector, e.g. t,- summarizing X ,- and u
summarizing Y. Then the association between each input dimension X ,- and the response dimension Y is measured by the covariance of their each
summary vectors, i.e. cov(t,-,u). The maximum covariance between summary vectors of X ,- and Y reveals a distinct association representing the coherent
proﬁles of X ,- and Y. The maximization can be achieved by how we construct the summary vectors by weighting variables and samples. This discovery

process is equivalent to the sparse version of the MBPLS problem

where the objective function Q(>) contains sparsity penalizations of the
loading vectors w,- (i: 1, 2, 3) and q.

2.4 Sparse multi-block PLS algorithm

To solve the problem in equation (2), we propose a sparse multi-block
PLS (sMBPLS) regression algorithm. In this algorithm, sparseo is the
soft thresholding function spars eA(x) = sign(x)(|x| — A) + that is used
to optimize the objective function with lasso penalties pA(x). We prove
that the sMBPLS algorithm can provide the maximizer of the sparse
multi-block PLS problem (see Supplementary material).

sMBPLS Algorithm

(1) Initialize: Apply the MBPLS algorithm to X1,X2,X3, Y and obtain
the latent variable u*. Set 11 = u*.

(2) Update:

(a) w,- = sparse),(X,—Tu), norm w,- (i = 1, 2, 3)

(b) t,- = Xiwi (or t,- = sparseu(X,-w,-)) (i = l, 2, 3)
(C) T: [t17t21t3]

(d) b = TTu, norm b

(e) t: Tb

(f) q = sparseA4(YTt), norm q

(g) u = Yq (or u = sparseu(Yq))

(3) Repeat Step 2 until convergence of t.

In this algorithm, 11 is regressed on each block X ,- to give the
loading vector w,- of the block, which are then multiplied through
the block to provide the latent variable t,—. All three latent variables
t1,t2,t3 are combined into the super block T and a classic PLS iterative
cycle between T and Y is performed to give the block weights b and
the combined latent variable t. We repeat this until convergence on t.
The computational complexity of one sMBPLS iteration is
0(Z?:1N,-K+ MK). We are also interested in selection over the
sample dimension. Specifically, we want to identify a multi-dimensional
module whose input variables have the maximum covariance with re-
sponse variables across a subset of samples. To achieve this goal, we
impose the sparse), function on Step 2(b) and Step 2(g) of the
sMBPLS algorithm to select samples.

The iterative procedure of the sMBPLS algorithm can be used to
obtain the ﬁrst set of sparse loading vectors wi,q and latent variables t.
The non-zero elements of converged loading vectors and latent variable
(t) identify a multi-dimensional module that contains subsets of input and
response variables and a subset of samples. After we identify a module,
we deﬂate the matrix by subtracting the signal of current set of loadings
and latent variables from the data matrices. Subsequent modules, or sub-
sequent sets of sparse loadings and latent variables, can be obtained se-
quentially by maximizing covariance on the deﬂated matrices. We used
the following deﬂation formula to remove the module’s signal from each
block:

1) = f,, (XiTti/(tiTti)), X,- <— X,- — tiuT, (i = 1,2,3)
11/ =fj, (YTu/(uTu)), Y <— Y— m/F

Whereﬁoo = 0 otherwise '

2.5 Tuning parameter selection

The sMBPLS algorithm is developed for ﬁxed A1,A2,A3,A4 (with the
option of including a). We tune these parameters using the
cross-validation procedure that was also used in recently proposed meth-
ods such as sparse PCA (Shen and Huang, 2008) and sparse PLS (Le Cao
et al., 2008). Tuning these parameters is equivalent to choosing the
‘degree of sparsity’, i.e. the number of non-zero components in each
loading vector and latent variable. Note that setting the degree of sparsity
to j (1 <j< Ill) (taking the loading vector q as an example) is equivalent to
setting A4 6 [|YTt|(D,|YTt|(I-+1)], where |YTt|(,-) is the jlh-order statistic of
YTt. Our computational framework allows different vectors to have dif-
ferent degrees of sparsity. To simplify notations, we use A1,A2,A3,A4 and p.
to denote the degrees of sparsity of loading vectors and latent variables in
the rest of the article. The cross-validation procedure is presented below.

(1) Randomly place the samples into L roughly equal groups. Each
group has a corresponding matrix from each block of data. That is,
the matrix of the rm genomic block data with only samples in the llh
group is denoted Xj; let XI.” be the matrix composed of data from
all other samples. The same notation applies to the response block
data Y, which is divided into Y’ and Y” for each group.

(2) For each combination of degrees of sparsity, A,- e {2,3,...,N,-}
(i: 1,2,3), A4 6 {2,3,...,]ll} and p. 6 {2,3, . 

(a) For I = 1, . . . ,L, apply the sMBPLS algorithm on
X1”,X2”,X3”, Y”, to derive loading vectors of independent vari-
ables: wf’,w2”,w3” and the loading vector of response variables

q”. Next, project X’l,X’2,X§,Y’ onto wl”,w2”,w3” and q” to

 

obtain the projection coefficients as all z iji” and
{I = Y’q”, respectively.
(b) Calculate the L-fold CV score deﬁned as
3 L r 1 4T 2 L r 1 4T 2
llX--S-W- || llY-{q II
V = I I I 3
C E KlNi + Z KIM ( )

':l [:1 [:1

where K, is the number of samples in the 1th group.

(3) Select the combination of degrees of sparsity {A1,A2,A3,A4,ﬂ} whose
CV score is the smallest.

L and the number of combinations of degrees of sparsity will impact
the computational efficiency. In practice, L is usually chosen to be S or 10
for large datasets. Naturally, a different random grouping in Step 1 may
result in different degrees of sparsity. Usually, the larger the value of L,
the more stable the degrees of sparsity selected by CV. In our study, we
use L = S, which is large enough for a stable selection of parameters. The
number of combinations of degrees of sparsity for the thresholds A,- (i = 1,
2, 3, 4) and p. is large for large-scale data. Therefore, in practice, we used
a subset of combinations in the cross-validation procedure.

3 RESULTS

To assess the performance of sMBPLS, we ﬁrst applied the
sMBPLS to a variety of simulated data, generated with various
complexities. We then applied sMBPLS to the multi-dimensional
TCGA ovarian cancer data to gain insights into the multi-layer
coordination of GE regulations. To reveal the advantages of
sMBPLS, we also compared our methods to several competing
methods including MBPLS, sparse PLS and biclustering methods.

3.1 Simulation study

The simulation data were generated by extending scenarios pro-
posed in the recent literature on sparse PLS methods (Chun and

Keles, 2010; Le Cao et al., 2008) to multi-dimensional data
(see Supplementary material for details). The scenario follow
the general model of Y = 2:1 ijjﬂj + E, where E is the
Gaussian noise and the settings of b,- and )3,- refer to the
Supplementary material. X,- is generated with various complexity:
different sizes, hidden component structures, correlation struc-
tures and even the presence of multicolinearity (simulated from a
multivariate normal with a ﬁrst-order autoregressive process’s
covariance matrix with auto-correlation p = 0.9).

In order to discover the multi-dimensional modules by using
MBPLS, an intuitive two-step procedure can be performed: first
applying MBPLS to the data, then selecting the top-ranking
input and response variables to form a module by ordering the
absolute values of the loadings and weight vectors. A more in-
tuitive comparison way is to sort the loadings and latent variable
from either MBPLS or sMBPLS, then to Visualize X1,X2,X3,Y
whose rows and columns are reordered by the sortings of their
loadings and weight vectors. The multi-dimensional module
would appear in the left-top and right-bottom corners (whose
corresponding variables and samples have large absolute values
of weights) in the reordered blocks. For example, the reordered
blocks by MBPLS as shown in Figure S1(B)-panel2 (in Supple-
mentary material) are observed to have no clear modular sub-
matrices in comers, while a multi-dimensional module can be
observed in reordered blocks by sMBPLS in Figure S1(B)-
panel3 and zoomed out in Figure S1(C).

We further systematically compared two methods by simulat-
ing data 50 times. We found that MBPLS always failed for all 50
simulation data in that it assigns totally different variables and
samples to the discovered module. In contrast, all modules iden-
tified by sMBPLS have significant overlaps with predefined mod-
ules. (Details of overlap significance test for modules can be
found in Section S3 of Supplementary material.) An example is
detailed in Figure S1. Since the MBPLS method maximizes the
covariance between all input and response variables across all
samples as shown in Figure S1(B), it overlooks embedded mod-
ules when the module’s signal is overwhelmed by background
noise. On the contrary, the sparsity penalty forces sMBPLS to
focus on ‘local’ (i.e. across a small subsets of variables and sam-
ples) peaks in the covariance, which correspond to (multi-
dimensional) modules of relatively small size. Our results show
that the sMBPLS method is more accurate at identifying mod-
ules in noisy data, and thus more suitable for biological
applications.

We also compared the sMBPLS with the sparse version of
PLS which is applied to the combined single input block
(i.e. X1,X2,X3 merged to a single block X). The same 50 times
of simulation data were used. The result showed that all modules
identiﬁed by sparse PLS have at least one dimension missing,
56% modules have two dimensions missing and none of these
modules module has signiﬁcant overlap with predefined module.
The lack of such power for the single-block approach may attri-
bute to the unbalanced covariance structures across multiple
blocks, i.e. the covariance signals of some blocks may be over-
whelmed by those of other blocks. The result is even worse when
we compared with a popular biclustering algorithm ‘SAMBA’
(Tanay et al., 2002) which is applied to the single block by mer-
ging X1,X2,X3,Y. All modules identiﬁed by SAMBA have at
least one dimension missing, and 84%/34% modules have at

least two/three dimensions missing. None of these modules has
overlaps with predefined modules.

3.2 Identifying MDRM in TCGA ovarian cancer data

We applied the sMBPLS method to the TCGA ovarian cancer
genomic data. We included four types of genomic data proﬁled
on the same 230 samples: CNV, DM, ME and GE. The data
were downloaded from http://cancergenome.nih.gov/. Detailed
preprocessing procedures can be found on the TCGA website
(we used the Level 3 data). We ﬁltered out genomic variables
with little variation across the whole sample (lu/a|<0.5, where u
and a are the mean and standard deviation of each variable),
resulting in a ﬁnal dataset with the expressions of 799
microRNAs and 15 846 genes, the CNV proﬁles of 31 324 loci
and the DMs of 14 735 marks (see Section S5 of Supplementary
material). We repeated the iterative cycle of sMBPLS to identify
the modules one by one, until no further signiﬁcant gain is
achieved on the covariances between input and response vari-
ables of the identiﬁed modules. In the following, we perform
further analysis on the top 100 modules. The details of the 100
modules can be found on the supplementary website.

On average, each module contains 30 samples, 45 CNV loci,
42 methylation marks, 5 microRNAs and 44 genes (see the figure
of the distribution of module sizes in Supplementary material).
We used the overlap signiﬁcance test on the identiﬁed 100 mod-
ules to investigate how distinct these modules are. Our results
showed that only one pair of modules has signiﬁcant overlap at
the level of P—Value after Bonferroni correction <0.05
(see Section S8 of Supplementary material). Figure 3 shows the
heat maps of two example modules, demonstrating the high
degree of (anti-)correlation between the four dimensions. As ex-
pected, genomic proﬁles of most CNV marks are positively cor-
related with the expression levels of genes. But we can also see
that genomic proﬁles of the methylation marks are sometimes
partially anti-correlated with the expression levels of genes. We
should note that our problem formulation shown in Figure 2(B)
is the covariance maximization between 11 (from Y) and the
weighted sum of t,- (from X,-), so it can well capture the holistic

correlations between response block and all input blocks. This
formulation can work well but cannot guarantee to identify those
modules in which each of input dimensions is highly correlated
with the response dimension. Therefore in some cases such as
shown Figure 3(B), there does exist some input dimension that
may not have expected correlation with the response dimension.
In addition to identifying multiple types of variables that jointly
explain the expression of a set of genes, sMBPLS also provides
the relative weights (i.e. the block weights b = [b1,b2,b3]) of each
dimension in contributing to the observed covariance. The
weight b,- (i=1, 2, 3) is proportional to the correlation of t,-
and u in the sMBPLS model. Among the 100 modules, we
observed a signiﬁcant correlation between the latent variables
t,- of the CNV, DM and ME dimensions and that u of the GE
dimension in 63, 100 and 91 modules, respectively (P-Value
<0.01, computed from a Student’s t distribution for a trans-
formation of the Pearson’s correlation). In reality, it is not ne-
cessary for all dimensions to be equally important. The block
weight information can help to identify important regulatory
factors from the selected variables. To evaluate how robust
these identiﬁed modules are, we randomly remove 10% samples
from the dataset and then performed the same procedure to
identify 100 modules. By using the overlap signiﬁcance test, we
checked the overlaps between them and the 100 modules identi-
ﬁed from full set of samples. The 74 modules identified from
90% samples show signiﬁcant overlaps over at least three dimen-
sions with 79 modules identified from full set of samples. This
result indicates good robustness of our method.

Because none of conventional methods can solve our problem,
we could only resort to comparing with those well-established
methods that can approximately arrive at our target. We used
two classes of conventional methods: (1) biclustering algorithms,
which identify correlated subsets of features across subsets of
samples from a single block (e.g. combined X and Y) and
(2) sparse PLS methods, which make regression analysis over
two blocks X and Y. The former is unsupervised learning for
exploratory data analysis while the latter is supervised learning.
We used SAMBA, a popular adopted biclustering algorithm
(Tanay et al., 2002), to perform on the block X combining all
four dimensions (CNV, DM, ME and GE). Out of the top 100
modules identiﬁed by SAMBA, 59% of the modules missed at
least one type of variables and 22% of the modules missed at
least two types of variables. We further compared our sMBPLS
approach to the sPLS approach in which we combined three
types of input data, CNV, DM and ME into a single combined
block X. Out of the top 100 modules identiﬁed by sPLS, 47% of
the modules missed at least one type of input variables and 17%
of the modules were only one-dimensional. This result showed
the unique advantage of multi-block modeling in capturing mod-
ules that elucidate relationships of variables from multiple
dimensions.

3.3 MDRMs reveal synergistic functions across multiple
dimensions

To evaluate the biological relevance of those identiﬁed
multi-dimensional modules, we first test the functional homogen-
eity for each dimension of them. A set of genes is deﬁned as
functionally homogenous if it is enriched in at least one GO

category (Ashburner et al., 2000) with a q—Value <0.05 (the
q—Value is the P-Value after a false discovery rate multiple testing
correction). This was often the case. The GE dimension is
functionally homogenous with respect to genes in 36% modules;
the CNV dimension with respect to CNV-harbored genes in
24% modules; the DM dimension with respect to Methylation
mark adjacent genes in 13% modules and the ME dimension
with respect to microRNA in 9% modules (microRNA function
was predicted based on the functions of their target genes), which
are signiﬁcantly higher than the 1.24%, 1.48%, 2.32% and
0.35% modules after randomization (Figure 4A), respectively.
Moreover, in 17 of those miRNA modules, miRNAs were
enriched with members from the same miRNA clusters
(q-Value <0.1 after multiple testing correction), where a
miRNA cluster is deﬁned as a set of miRNAs located within
50 kb in the genome (Baskerville and Bartel, 2005). miRNAs in
a cluster are expected to play related functional roles Wuan
et al., 2009). For example, the Module 96 includes five
miRNAs (miR-let-7e, miR-125a, miR-150, miR-200c and
miR-141). Two of these, let-7e and 125a, are members of a
miRNA cluster in chromosome 19, while miR-200c and
miR-141 belong to another miRNA cluster in chromosome 12.
It can also be shown that many modules contain genes targeted
by miRNAs in the same modules (see Section S6 in
Supplementary material). Members of the let-7-family have
been extensively reported to suppress ovarian cancers
(Koturbash et al., 2010). Also, miR-125a, miR-200c and
miR-141 were reported to be dys-regulated in ovarian cancer.
To take another example, Module 45 covers three miRNAs
(miR-27a, miR-23a and miR-205). Interestingly, miR-27a and
miR-23a are clustered in the genome and both have been re-
ported to be up-regulated in ovarian cancer (Koturbash et al.,
2010). In addition, miR-205 has been extensively studied in

relation to cancers of the bladder, lung, pancreatic, breast,
esophagus and prostate.

While the individual dimensions of those modules already ex-
hibit significant level of functional homogeneity, combining all
dimensions reveals an even stronger functional synergy. When
we consider all genes in the GE dimension, CNV-harbored genes,
methylation adjacent genes and microRNAs, 48 out of the 100
modules were found to be functionally homogenous (Figure 4),
compared to 3.8% modules in randomized data. This result high-
lights the power of multi-dimensional modules in grouping func-
tionally relevant factors from different regulatory layers. In
addition, we further compared the q-Values of GO terms enriched
for modules identified by either our method or the sparse PLS
method by following the comparison procedure described in
(Costa et al., 2008; Ernst et al., 2005). The result indicates that
our method can identify more functionally homogeneous
modules with more diverse GO terms (see Section S7 of
Supplementary material). Many of the identiﬁed modules are
enriched of the biological processes such as cell cycle, cell acti-
vation, immune system process and so on, implying their possible
involvement in cancer. Also, they contain many important genes
(or microRNAs) known to be related to ovarian cancer. For
example, Module 37 includes four HOX family genes (HOXBZ,
HOXB4, HOXB6 and HOXB7) that all have been extensively
reported to be related with ovarian cancer (Cheng et al., 2005;
Ota et al., 2009; Widschwendter et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2007). In
addition, the module contains a DM mark adjacent to HOXA9
that was reported to be signiﬁcantly hypermethylated in ovarian
cancer patients (W idschwendter et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2007). In
addition, the member genes FGFI9, GASZ, BMP7, TNFSFII,
and FGFR3 are all known to play important roles in tumor
genesis and progression. In the Module 76, miR-214, known to
be involved in cell cycle, has been reported to be dys-regulated in
ovarian cancer (Iorio et al., 2007; Nam et al., 2008; Yang et al.,
2008), and CDH]3 is a potential epigenetic biomarker for ovar-
ian cancer (Wu et al., 2007).

We then test the transcriptional homogeneity for each dimen-
sion of the identiﬁed multi-dimensional modules. We used the
191 ChIP-seq profiles generated by the Encyclopedia of DNA
Elements (ENCODE) consortium (Thomas et al., 2007). This
dataset includes the genome-wide binding of 40 TFs, 9 histone
modiﬁcation marks and 3 other markers (DNase, FAIRE and
DM) on 25 different cell lines (see Supplementary material).
These data provide a set of potential targets of regulatory fac-
tors. A set of genes is deﬁned as ‘transcriptional homogenous’ if
it is enriched in the targets for any regulatory factor with a 1]-
Value <0.05. We achieved similar results as those of functional
homogeneity analysis (Figure 4B). These modules are enriched of
the TFs such as SRF, STAT] and H3K27me3. SRF regulates the
activity of many immediate-early genes and thereby participates
in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, cell growth and cell differen-
tiation. STA T] enhances inﬂammation and innate and adaptive
immunity, triggering in most instances anti-proliferative and
pro-apoptotic responses in tumor cells (Pensa et al., 2009).
Particularly, STAT] negatively regulates the cell cycle by indu-
cing p2] WAFI/CIP] in ovarian cancer (Burke et al., 1999).
H3K27me3 has been evaluated as a prognostic indicator for clin-
ical outcome in patients with breast and ovarian cancers (Wei
et al., 2008).

3.4 MDRMs facilitate the regulatory analysis

Our method has provided sets of genomic features from different
regulatory layers that are likely to be synergistic in their impact
on GE. To further elaborate the relationships between
those implicated features, we used the Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis (IPA) system (Redwood City, CA, USA) to build mo-
lecular interaction networks. From each multi-dimensional
module, we formed a set consisting of genes involved in the
GE dimension, CNV-harbored genes, methylation-adjacent
genes and microRNAs. Using this set as the input, IPA con-
structs networks based on literature-derived relationships be-
tween genes (or microRNAs) and computes a ranking score
—Iog(p) for each network. The P—Value indicates the likelihood
that the genes in the input network would be found together due
to random chance. All of the multi-dimensional modules lead to
statistically significant interaction networks (P—Value < 1.0E-20)
by this analysis, which indicates the signiﬁcant associations
among them.

Below, we provide in-depth descriptions of the heterogeneous
regulatory networks that affect a key tumor suppressor gene
(EGR]) and an oncogene (AKT) in ovarian cancer. EGR] is a
cancer-suppressing gene known to be down-regulated in ovarian
cancer (Lamber et al., 2010). The network derived from the
Module 4 reveals that complex connections of heterogeneous
factors control the expression of EGR] (Figure 5A). A direct
regulation on ERG] comes from PITX2, a gene adjacent to a
DM mark in our module and known to be essential for the
expression of EGR] in rat (Suh et al., 2002). Multiple indirect
inﬂuences on EGR] are transmitted by the TF NFICB, by GNA]5
and GNA]] (genes hosted by CNVs in the module) and by
FCERZ (genes adjacent to the methylation marks in the
module). In particular, WT] (regulated by DM) is known to
positively regulate AMH (Nachtigal et al., 1998) (which is also
regulated by a CNV), which in turn positively regulates EGR]
Via NFICB. In addition, EGR] is regulated by both TMEMI73
and ENTD] (adjacent to methylations) Via ERK and P38
MARK, respectively. The disruption of multiple neighbor
nodes to EGR] by different regulatory mechanisms highlights
the complex nature of the controls on this key suppressor gene
for ovarian cancer. As another example, from Module 61 we
derived a multi-layer coordinated network (Figure 5B) regulating
AKT, a key oncogene for ovarian cancer (Altomare et al., 2004;

Multi-layer gene regulatory modules

 

Yuan et al., 2000) and an important component of the
PI3—kinase/AKT pathway. The expression of AKT is positively
regulated by the loss of a CNV-containing PTEN, which would
otherwise down-regulate the expression of AKT (Pore et al.,
2003). Moreover, AKT is activated by CDHZ (Rieger-Christ
et al., 2004), the expression of which, in turn, is increased by
EDN3 (Bagnato et al., 2004). AKT is further up-regulated due
to the methylation of RASSF] (a tumor suppressor gene), which
is consistent with the previously observed over-expression of
AKT in RASSF]A-depleted cells (Dallol et al., 2005). Additional
regulations are exerted by the loss of KSR] (CNV), the methy-
lated S TAT5A and the expression of MAG, among others. These
factors, intertwined together, paint complex mechanisms leading
to the activation of the important oncogene AKT in ovarian
cancer.

In addition to the two examples detailed above, we observed
multi-layer coupled regulatory networks around multiple onco-
genes or tumor suppressor genes (e.g. PIK3CA and CCNEI).
The results of this analysis clearly illustrate and illuminate the
complex genetic origins of ovarian cancer. In fact, CNV, methy-
lation and microRNA regulation are only few of the many
expression regulatory mechanisms, and much more sophisticated
coordination likely exists in the origins of this illness. The algo-
rithm proposed in this study takes the first steps along the path
to effectively integrate multi-dimensional data to explore the
complex regulatory mechanisms.

4 CONCLUSIONS

In this study, we developed a sMBPLS regression method to
identify multi-dimensional regulatory modules in diverse types
of genomic data measured on the same set of samples.
Classical eQTL analysis can only be applied to relate one type
of genomic marker (e. g. SNP) to GE. In contrast, sMBPLS can
identify combinations of multiple types of genomic markers that
jointly impact the expression of a set of genes. We have applied
the sMBPLS method to a suite of genomic proﬁles from 230
ovarian cancer samples, including CNV, DM, microRNA and
GE data. The algorithm identiﬁed 100 modules, many of which
display a high degree of functional homogeneity in at least one
genomic dimension. If all dimensions of data are considered to-
gether, the modules exhibit an even greater degree of functional
synergy. A detailed network View of individual modules reveals
that many genomic features would remain isolated if we only
considered one type of data. By combining diverse types of
data, sMBPLS links the different regulatory layers and thus dis-
covers more coherent and connected regulatory networks.
Furthermore, our method derives weights for the dimensions
of CNV, methylation and microRNA in each module, which
indicate their relative contributions to the expression of individ-
ual sets of genes. We have demonstrated that multiple heteroge-
neous factors in a module can have combinatorial effects on GE.
We should note that (1) this does not necessarily reﬂect the direct
causal mechanisms for GE, but the revealed modules can be a
good start point to further study the underlying mechanisms;
(2) sMBPLS outperforms most existing algorithms in analyzing
more than two data blocks, although it may not possibly im-
prove the results when applied to only two blocks X and Y.

In summary, we expect that there will soon be a rapid increase
of multi-dimensional data, and developing methods for such
data will become an active research area. We have proposed a
promising tool to extract coherent substructures from large-scale,
complex datasets, greatly facilitating downstream biological
analysis. Interpreting such complex modules is still a major
challenge, given our limited knowledge of multi-layer coordin-
ation in biological systems. However, the rapid accumulation of
multi-dimensional data and the knowledge derived from them
will deﬁnitely accelerate a positive cycle of the knowledge
discovery.

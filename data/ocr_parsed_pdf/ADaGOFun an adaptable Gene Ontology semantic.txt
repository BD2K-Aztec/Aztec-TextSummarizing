Abstract

Summary: Gene Ontology (GO) semantic similarity measures are being used for biological knowledge
discovery based on GO annotations by integrating biological information contained in the GO structure
into data analyses. To empower users to quickly compute, manipulate and explore these measures,
we introduce A—DaGO—Fun (ADaptable Gene Ontology semantic similarity—based Functional analysis).
It is a portable software package integrating all known GO information content—based semantic similar—
ity measures and relevant biological applications associated with these measures. A—DaGO—Fun has
the advantage not only of handling datasets from the current high—throughput genome—wide applica—
tions, but also allowing users to choose the most relevant semantic similarity approach for their biolo—
gical applications and to adapt a given module to their needs.

Availability and implementation: A—DaGO—Fun is freely available to the research community at
http://web.cbio.uct.ac.za/ITGOM/adagofun. It is implemented in Linux using Python under free soft—
ware (GNU General Public Licence).

1 Introduction

Recent years have experienced an exponential growth of publicly
available and accessible genomics, proteomics and other biological
data resulting from high-throughput biology technologies and compu-
tational scanning approaches. Retrieving information from these dif-
ferent biological data constitutes an essential step and challenging task
which requires the use of computational tools and algorithms for
translating these data into different applications. In the context of
functional annotation data, the Gene Ontology (GO—Consortium,
2012) provides a way of consistently describing genes and proteins in
any organism, producing a well-adapted platform to computationally
process data at the functional level. Currently, ~30 629514 proteins
are already annotated with Gene Ontology (GO) terms in the existing

biological databases (see the latest version of GOA UniProt version
143 at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA/uniprotirelease, released on 27
May, 2015), thus enabling protein comparisons on the basis of their
GO annotations. Several semantic similarity (SS) measures (Mazandu
and Mulder, 2013b, 2014) have been suggested to tackle major chal-
lenges for knowledge discovery based on these GO annotations.
The recent proliferation of these measures in the biomedical and bio-
inforniatics areas was accompanied by the development of tools
(http://neurolex.org/wiki/CategoryzResource:GeneiOntologyiTools)
that facilitate effective exploration of these measures. These tools in-
clude software packages and web-based on-line tools.

None of these tools support all relevant topology-based
approaches in the context of GO, except the DaGO-Fun on-line tool

Abstract

Motivation: Bacterial luciferases are heterodimeric enzymes that catalyze a chemical reaction, so
called bioluminescence, which causes light emission in bacteria. Bioluminescence is vastly used as
a reporter system in research tools and commercial developments. However, the details of the
mechanisms that stabilize and transform the reaction intermediates as well as differences in the en—
zymatic kinetics amongst different bacterial luciferases remain to be elucidated.

Results: Amino acid sequences alignments for 21 bacterial luciferases (both 06- and ﬁ—subunits)
were analyzed. For oc—subunit, containing the enzyme active center, 48 polymorphic amino acid pos—
itions were identified. According to them, the sequences fell into two distinct groups known as
slow and fast based on the decay rate of the bioluminescence reaction. The differences in the en—
zyme active site induced by structural polymorphism are analyzed.

Availability and implementation: Three—dimensional models of Photobacterium leiognathi lucifer—
ase and Vibrio harveyi luciferase (with reconstructed mobile loop) are freely available at PMDB

database: PM0080525 and PM0080526, respectively.

1 Introduction

Luminous bacteria are known as the most abundant and ubiquitous
bioluminescent organisms. Their traditional classification was
rooted in the morphological peculiarities, metabolism and ecological
distribution of light emitting species. Currently, according to the se—
quence analysis of 16S rRNA and gyrB genes, all known luminous
bacteria are assigned to three Gammaproteobacteria families:
Vibrionaceae, Shewanellaceae and Enterobacteriaceae (Dunlap and
Urbanczyk, 2013). In spite of several studies, many details about the
mechanism of bacterial bioluminescence including the differences in
reaction kinetics are yet to be known.

Although the investigations has identified the sequence of about
21 bacterial luciferases, but could only solve the crystal structure of

luciferase from Vibrio harveyi (Campbell et (11., 2009). Bacterial
luciferase consists of 0L— and B—subunit folded into the same type of
((3/008 or TIM barrel structure and encoded by luxA and luxB genes.
In addition to the structure similarities, 0L— and B—subunits share
about 32% of sequence identity, indicating that luxB gene might
have evolved as a result of luxA gene duplication (Baldwin et (11.,
1979). However, oc—subunit is larger due to additional 29 amino acid
residues, which constitutes a mobile loop ﬂanking the active site of
the enzyme and playing an important role in binding to the sub—
strates (Campbell and Baldwin, 2009).

All known bacterial luciferases catalyze the same oxidative reac—
tion (Fig. 1), where R—CHO and R—COOH are a long—chain aliphatic
aldehyde and corresponding carboxylic acid, FMNH2 and FMN—

reduced and oxidized ﬂavin mononucleotide respectively. Interaction
of luciferase with the substrates causes the electronically excited spe—
cies formation and following light emission. The emitted light then
slowly decays in a first—order kinetics manner (Fig. 1B and C). The
maximum light intensity of the reaction is proportional to the amount
of the enzyme, and the decay depends on the rate constant of the en—
zyme and the aldehyde chain length. Light intensity and decay kinetics
vary among luciferases from different species. However, two types of
luciferases slow and fast, can be distinguished by the decay patterns
(enzyme turnover time) (Fig. 1) (Nealson and Hastings, 1979).
Luciferases from Photobacterium species are fast decay enzymes (the
rate is within 0.64—1.0571), while the luciferase from Vibrio and
Photor/oabdus are slow (0.12 5’1) (Nealson and Hastings, 1979;
Tinikul and Chaiyen, 2014). The reasons for the kinetic differences
are associated with binding to the substrates (Tinikul and Chaiyen,
2014), duration of time that it takes to form the intermediates in the
reaction (Abu—Soud et (11., 1993), and the decay rate of the hydroper—
oxy ﬂavin intermediate upon stabilization by the binding pocket en—
vironment (Lin et (11., 2002). So far only a few luciferases from limited
range of bacterial species are studied. However, analysis of new lumi—
nous bacterial genomes can assist to better understand the bacterial
bioluminescence.

The current research aimed to identify the conservative motifs
that are involved in the active site formation of bacterial luciferases.
We analyzed the phylogenetic relationship of luciferase amino acid
sequences from 21 luminous bacteria. Our data showed two clades
of the luciferases that relate bacteria, which share similar reaction
kinetics. We also identified the residues that are important to form
the bacterial groups and discussed the structural differences between
the enzymatic active sites as well as the mechanisms to stabilize the
ﬂavin intermediates between two groups.

2 Materials and methods

We studied amino acid sequences of luciferases from 21 luminous
bacteria: Afisc/oeri E5114, A.logei KCh1 and A.salmonicida NCMB
2262 from Aliivibrio genus; Candidatus Photodesmus katoptron
Akat1; Raquimaris NBRC 104633, Rdamselae BT—6, Rkis/oitanii
NCMB 844, Rleiognat/oi lnuch.13.1, P.l. subsp. mandapamensis
ATCC 27561, Rphosphoreum MIE from Photobacterium genus;
Phasymbiotica and Phluminescens ATCC 29999 from
Photorhabdus genus; SJoanedai NCIMB 2157 and Swoodyi ATCC
51908 from Shewanella genus; Valbensis VL 426, Vazureus NBRC
104587, Vcampbellii ATCC BAA—1116, Vchagasii SB—52, Vbarveyi

NBRC 15634, Vorientalis ATCC 33934 and Vvulniﬂcus ATCC
43382 from Vibro genus. We performed the phylogenetic analysis
on the amino acid sequences of 0L— and B—subunits using the Jalview
program package (version 2.8.1, (Waterhouse et (11., 2009)). The
dataset was analyzed with the multiple sequence alignment software
MAFFT (Katoh and Standley, 2013) and BLOSUM 62 as substitu—
tion matrix, a gap open penalty of 1.53 and a gap extension penalty
of 0.123 were used. ProtTest (Abascal et (11., 2005) enabled to iden—
tify LG+G as the best—fit amino acid replacement model for the
evolution of both subunits. This model was used to build phylogen—
etic trees with the PhyML software (Guindon et (11., 2010). To find
the roots of reconstructed trees we added an outgroup. Moreover,
the ape package (version 3.1—4, (Paradis et (11., 2004)) enabled us to
perform other analysis in an open source environment
R/Bio—conductor (Gentleman et (11., 2004).

In order to build the tertiary structure of other bacterial lucifer—
ases—using the Swiss—MODEL server (Biasini et (11., 2014)—we
applied the crystal structure of Vbarveyi luciferase (PDB ID: 3FGC)
as a template. Then we optimized the obtained structures for 1 ns at
300 K and a constant pressure of 1 atm, using a model of explicit
water SPC/E and CHARMM27 force field in GROMACS (version
5.0.3, (Pronk et (11., 2013)). We also analyzed the enzymatic active
sites by using VMD (Humphrey et (11., 1996). The tertiary structures
for other slow luciferases in vicinity of active center were found un—
changed if compare with that of Vbarveyi luciferase. The enzymes
among the fast group also demonstrated very similar architecture of
the binding pocket, but different from the Vbarveyi one.

3 Results and discussion

3.1 Conservative regions

The amino acid sequence analysis revealed that the pairwise se—
quence identity among 21 species is 53—99% for oc—subunit and
43—98% for B—subunit (Supplementary Table $1). This finding is in
a good agreement with previously reported amino acid identity lev—
els that were obtained for 6 species of Photobacterium,
Photorhabdus and Vibrio genus (Meighen, 1991). oc—subunits were
found to have highly conserved amino acid sequences with 138 iden—
tical positions. Eight of them: ocGlu43, ocHis44, ocHis45, ocArg107,
ocTyrllo, ocAsp113, ocArgnS, ocGlu175 are known to be critical for
catalytic activity of the enzyme (Hou et (11., 2014; Huang and Tu,
1997; Madvar and Naderi—Manesh, 2007; Moore et (11., 1999; Xin
et (11., 1991). According to the crystal structure of Vbarveyi lucifer—
ase, the active center (a cavity within 6  distance from FMN bind—
ing site) consists of 35 amino acid residues where 20 of them are
conserved. Such conservative amino acids gathering allows forming
the proper structure of the substrate—binding pocket.

Another substantial part of oc—subunit conserved residues were
found on the 01/ B—interface: 25 identical amino acids can be observed
within 4  distance from the B—subunit surface. More than a third of
B—subunit conserved regions are also contacting with oc—subunit (25
positions). That confirms a proposed important function of the
B—subunit—the stabilization of the oc—subunit active conformation
(Campbell et (11., 2009).

3.2 Two groups of luciferases

Phylogenetic analysis of oc—subunit amino acid sequences revealed
two clades of luciferases with 65.01 and 53.99% identity within
each group (Fig. 2). These groups significantly correspond to the
previous classification of luciferases as slow or fast according to
their kinetic properties. Phylogenetic analysis of luciferase oc—subunit

Fig. 2. Phylogenetic tree for oc-subunit amino acid sequences of bacterial luci-
ferases. Bacteria in each clade share similar reaction kinetics. The names of
bacteria with experimentally confirmed enzyme kinetics are in boldface

sequences helped to predict the type of enzyme with unknown kin—
etics. According to the tree the luciferase from Candidatus
Photodesmus katoptron probably belongs to slow type, as well as
the rest of luciferases from Vibrio species, while luciferases of
Aliivibrio and Shewanella are of fast type.

Exact and partial matches found in specific positions of the
studied sequences characterize two observed clades (Supplementary
Table S2). Exact match refers to a residue that is strictly conserved
among a group. For instance, all fast luciferases contain Leu, while
all slow luciferases have Ala at position 183 without an exception
(ocLeu183 versus ocAla183). Partial match refers to less than four resi—
dues of the same type (according to polarity, side—chain group type,
etc.) in one position showing the tendency for the same clade forma—
tion. For example, all fast luciferases have Arg in contrast to Asn
of slow luciferases at a position 26 except for Phasymbiotica and
Phluminescence having ocLyszs.

We have identified 22 exact matches on the oc—subunit, which
constitute an inherent feature of the found clades. Vicinity of the ac—
tive site (the area within 6  distance from FMN molecule bound to
the active site and close to it) contains 11 out of 22 exact matches.
Four of them (ocAla74, ocAla75, ocCyslos, ocVall73 were previously
described as critical for proper functioning of slow Vharveyi lucifer—
ase (Fisher et (11., 1995; Hou et (11., 2014; Lin et (11., 2004)).

In addition to 22 exact residue matches specific for two groups of
oc—subunit sequences, 26 partial residue matches were found. Two of
them were experimentally identified as important residues for lucifer—
ase functioning: ctiSer227 (Chen and Baldwin, 1989) and orLys286
(Campbell and Baldwin, 2009). The latter is located on the enzyme
mobile loop and stabilizes the reaction intermediates. OLSer227 is im—
portant to form the tertiary structure of the enzyme. Inspecting the
crystal structure, we observed that residues meeting partial residue
matches spread across the structure unlike the residues identified as
exact matches. The observed tendency can indicate that residues with
partial matches are necessary to preserve the tertiary structure.

A number of previous studies have tried to convert a slow lucifer—
ase into fast type by changing a sequence of segment (residues 166—
233) near the active center with a template sequence from fast luci—
ferase (Valkova et (11., 1999) or site directed mutagenesis of ctiGlu175
residue (Hosseinkhani et (11., 2005). Valkova et al. recorded changes
in the kinetic properties of luciferase, but simultaneously observed a
substantial loss in the enzyme activity (up to 0.03% of the wild type
activity). According to our findings, the substituted part (67 a.a.)
consists of 24 conservative residues, 6 amino acids that meet exact
matches (i.e. are supposed to define slow or fast type of kinetics)

and 3 residues that are described here as partial matches. However,
the rest of the substituted residues (34 a.a.) are different from the
wild type enzyme. This difference might have caused tertiary struc—
ture distortion and less enzymatic activity. Regarding ocGlu175, we
found that it is conserved among all studied luminous bacteria;
therefore, this residue is unlikely to be responsible for the type of
kinetics. Mutation of ctiGlu175 induced higher structure ﬂexibility
and destabilized the reaction intermediates. These changes intensi—
fied the dark pathways of the reaction and finally increased the kin—
etics of the enzyme. It is noteworthy that natural fast luciferases are
highly active, and some of them even more active than the slow ones
(Katsev et (11., 2004).

The B—subunit of bacterial luciferase is assumed to stabilize the oc—
subunit active conformation through hydrogen bonds and a number
of specific hydrophobic interactions. Experiments revealed an import—
ant role of interaction between OlPl’l6272 and [3Tyr151 for the activity of
Vharveyi luciferase (Campbell et (11., 2009). We found that OlPl’l6272
meets the exact residue match: ocTyr in all fast luciferases versus ocPhe
in slow ones. Interestingly, the B—subunits also undergo BTyr—BPhe
substitutions, that probably indicates a similar stabilization mechan—
ism conserved among all luminous bacterial species including aro—
matic stacking interaction between amino acid side chains.

Phylogenetic tree for B—subunit exhibit distinct clades for slow
and fast luciferases as well as for oc—subunit (Supplementary Figure
S1). However only 7 exact and 19 partial matches were identified
through B—subunit sequences alignment analysis (Supplementary
Table S3).

The mechanisms for origin of fast and slow luciferases from the
only ancestor are poorly understood yet. Some correlation of kin—
etics type could be found only with ecological niches. Species having
slow luciferases are mostly free—living, while fast decay luciferases
are typical for symbiotic luminous bacteria (Dunlap and Urbanczyk,
2013). However, it was shown that phylogenies of luminous bac—
teria and their host organisms exhibited no meaningful topological
congruence (Dunlap et (11., 2007). To address functional evolution
of bacterial luciferases an investigation of changes on the lineages
with consensus tree reconstruction should be done (Arenas and
Posada, 2010).

3.3 Analysis of luciferases active centers

The fact that many of oc—subunit exact matches are located in the ac—
tive site or close to it allows examining all differences that might ap—
pear in the structure of this part of the enzyme. We have
reconstructed 3D—structure for Rleiognat/oi luciferase as the repre—
sentative of fast group and made structure optimization with mo—
lecular dynamics. Mapping of active centers revealed TIM barrel
structure preservation for both fast and slow luciferases. Moreover,
the structure of the binding pocket varied due to distinctions in
amino acid composition. Additionally we have identified two signifi—
cant differences in the active center structure for slow and fast en—
zymes caused by four exact amino acids substitutions.

We observed the phenylalanine shifting (orPhe6 <—> ocIleG, orLeu8 <—>
ocPhes) (Fig. 3A). orPhe6 (in Vbarveyi slow luciferase) and OLPhe8 (in
modelled P.1eiognat/7i fast luciferase) are found at the si—face side of
the isoalloxazine moiety. In both cases they form the active site es—
sential for protein—ligand binding which involves hydrophobic and
stacking interactions. Substitution to hydrophobic residues such as
leucine and isoleucine is also very common and preserves the hydro—
phobic surfaces in the active site.

Furthermore, we studied the utilization of alternative sulphur—
containing amino acid (OLAla74 <—> ocMet74, ctiCys106 <—> ocVallos) that

taining amino acid (ocAla7‘<—> at Met", ocCys106 <—> at Valms)

stabilize the ﬂavin derivatives (Fig. 3B). Bioluminescent reaction in—
cludes a step where the addition of 02 molecule and deprotonation
of N1 results in hydroperoxy ﬂavin formation in complex with en—
zyme (Hou et (11., 2014). Abu—Soud et al. showed that ctiCys106 i
involved into this reaction step, because its mutation to ocVa

s
1106
leads to extremely unstable complex of luciferase with hydroperoxy
ﬂavin intermediate and reduces the bioluminescence activity (Abu—
Soud et (11., 1993). However, a double mutant luciferase with ocGly75
and ctiVal106 instead of chla75 and ctiCys106 showed high enzyme ac—
tivity and a stable intermediate, but fast luminescence decay (Lin
et (11., 2002). This is in good accordance with our findings that
chla75 and ctiCys106 refer to exact matches of slow group, whereas
OlGly75 and ctiVal106 belong to exact matches of fast group.
Inspecting the modeled active sites of fast luciferases for sulfur—
containing residues that could manage the same function as

106

ocCys , we observed ctiMet74 residue. It is one of highly conserved

amino acids among fast luciferases group (exact match). Therefore

106 in fast

we can conclude that ctiMet74 roles as a substitute to ocCys
luciferases which is also able to form a hydrogen bond through its
sulphur group. It is likely that ctiMet74 interacts with N5 atom, while
ctiCys106 probably contacts with N1 (Fig. 3B). Consequently ocMet74,
ocGly75 and OlVallOG probably form an important part of the active
site that stabilizes the intermediates in fast luciferases, similar to
orAla74, orAla75 and ctiCys106 in slow ones.

To our knowledge the existence of two evolutionary conserved
binding platforms could not be related with all variations in metabol—
ism and luminous system regulation. The important physiological role
of luminescence reaction is proposed to be as a secondary respiratory
chain that is active when oxygen or iron levels are too low for the
cytochrome system to operate (Dunlap and Urbanczyk, 2013). It per—
mits cells to continue growing even under microaerobic conditions,
such as in animal gut tracts. Previously it was obtained some correl—
ation between type of kinetics and sensitivity of bacterial strains to
hydrogen peroxide (Katsev et (11., 2004). But causal relationship in
this observations and connection with the luciferase polymorphic
forms is had to be understood on the basis of whole picture on lumi—
nous bacteria evolution and metabolism. The occurrence of two bind—
ing platforms probably plays an important role relying on the whole
picture of luminous bacteria phylogeny and metabolism.

4 Conclusion

Study of the conservative motifs critical for the interaction of the
bacterial luciferase with substrates and intermediates stabilization is
far reaching in terms of understanding the mechanism of biolumin—
escence. In this study, we presented a phylogenetic analysis of amino

acids important for light emitting reaction. Our data suggested the
conservative positions in structure of all known bacterial luciferases,
and amino acids causing the division into fast and slow types of this
enzyme. We found two sets of critical amino acids exactly matching
each types of luciferases and probably responsible for kinetic decay
rate. Through protein structure homology modelling, we observed
the formation of two different binding platforms that probably sta—
bilize the reaction intermediates. Two evolutionary fixed types of re—
action kinetics could indicate the appearance of two different
functions carried by bacterial luciferases that never been discussed
before from the structural point of view.

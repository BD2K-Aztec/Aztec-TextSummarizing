ABSTRACT

Motivation: Pathway diagrams from PubMed and World Wide Web
(WWW) contain valuable highly curated information difficult to reach
without tools specifically designed and customized for the biological
semantics and high-content density of the images. There is currently
no search engine or tool that can analyze pathway images, extract
their pathway components (molecules, genes, proteins, organelles,
cells, organs, etc.) and indicate their relationships.

Results: Here, we describe a resource of pathway diagrams
retrieved from article and web-page images through optical
character recognition, in conjunction with data mining and data
integration methods. The recognized pathways are integrated into
the BiologicalNetworks research environment linking them to a
wealth of data available in the BiologicalNetworks’ knowledgebase,
which integrates data from > 100 public data sources and the
biomedical literature. Multiple search and analytical tools are
available that allow the recognized cellular pathways, molecular
networks and cell/tissue/organ diagrams to be studied in the context
of integrated knowledge, experimental data and the literature.
Availability: BiologicalNetworks software and the pathway
repository are freely available at www.biologicalnetworks.org.

Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at
Bioinformatics online.

1 INTRODUCTION

Biological pathways provide intuitive views of the myriad of
interactions involved in biological processes. A typical signaling
pathway, for example, can represent receptor-binding events,
protein complexes, phosphorylation reactions, translocations and
transcriptional regulation, usually depicted with a set of symbols,
with lines and arrows. Automated detection of genes and proteins
and inference of signaling network architecture and dynamics from
general (Peng et (11., 2008; Rodriguez-Esteban et (11., 2009; Shatkay
et (11., 2006) as well as domain speciﬁc (Brass et (11., 2008; Conrad
et (11., 2004; Kaplow et (11., 2009; Nir et (11., 2010; Neumann et (11.,
2006; Peng et (11., 2008) imaging data, has been of increasing interest
during last years. These sophisticated methods were implemented
only for a speciﬁc domain and do not provide public services
for extracted pathways analysis or a software for a broader use.
Thus in spite of the importance of collecting and maintaining
pathway information, with the attendant biological annotations and
experimental data, pathways construction, curation and integration

with public databases and experimental data remain a tedious and
time-consuming task (Cerami et (11., 2011; Kanehisha et (11., 2010;
Kelder et (11., 2009; Schaefer et (11., 2009).

A small number of systems have considered the issue of ﬁgure
retrieval: Sub-cellular Location Image Finder (Murphy et (11., 2004)
that retrieves ﬂuorescence micrograph images from a single-journal
corpus; BioText (Hearst et (11., 2007) and Yale Image Finder (YIF)
(Xu et (11., 2008) that performs text queries of ﬁgures legends. None
of these methods analyzes information embedded in the image itself,
nor do they compare with and supplement knowledge available in
public databases and PudMed.

Here we present the system that addresses the problems
of extraction, comparison, searching and managing biological
knowledge embedded in pathway imaging data. The system provides
a repository of freely available pathways recognized from imaging
data. The repository allows biologists to explore, search over
pathway components in open access publications and World
Wide Web (WW) and construct user’s pathways and interaction
networks. These pathways can be visualized and dynamically
analyzed in concert with data integrated from other public databases
and literature.

2 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
2.1 Methods

The process of image recognition, data extraction and integration
consists of several steps (Supplementary Fig. 51). First, objects
and relations are extracted from the image, together with their
coordinates. This is done using mathematical morphology and binary
analysis routines of Image] (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). The image
is transferred to binary gray-scale 32-bit RGB mode by applying
a threshold adjustment with a Huang Filter. Special mathematical
morphology ‘Opening’ after ‘Closing’ operations are applied to
reduce the number of domains for recognition by removing areas
that are too small. Finally, an ‘analyze particles’ procedure applied
to the last image retrieves all possible candidates for nodes as objects
represented by points of an enclosing polygon.

Text recognition is done separately with preliminary image
processing (Kou et (11., 2007; Li et (11., 2008). Cleaning non-textual
elements using properties that Characterize horizontal text objects,
such as alignment, height—width ratio, Character separation and
connectedness, is performed. ‘Cognitive OpenOCR (Cuneiform)’
(http://en.openocr.org) software is used for batch image text
recognition and ‘AutoIt v3’ (http://www.autoitscript.com)
for automated batch operations. The scanning procedure is
executed both horizontally and vertically to extract horizontal and
vertical text.

The next step involves the extracted text, objects and relations
being sent to the IntegromeDB (Baitaluk et (11., 2010) (back-end

database) data integration pipeline to Check the consistency of
the data (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Table S1). We Check that
all recognized objects are genes/proteins, processes, cell types,
diseases or any other object type constituting BioNets ontology
(Baitaluk et (11., 2010; Kozhenkov et (11., 2011) in our database.
Recognized relations are compared with the existing (literature
or pubic databases) interactions, reactions and relations integrated
in the IntegromeDB from >100 of public databases. Only those
recognized relations that are supported by at least one type of
evidence from our integrated database are included in the ﬁnal
pathway.

We scanned a collection of >150 journals, 50000 articles and
~25 000 ﬁgures available in PubMed Central and WW through
the Google Image service API by querying terms from Pathway
Ontology (e.g. ‘Nicotine pathway’), Gene Ontology Biological
Process (e.g. ‘molecular synthesis’), ‘$GeneName pathway’ (e.g.
‘NF-B pathway’), etc. After ﬁltering out images not containing
objects/relations, top 1012 pathway/network diagrams (richest
in number of literature-supported relations) are stored on a
remote server and the Lucene open-source search engine (http://
lucene.apache.org) is used to index, retrieve and rank the image
text descriptions (using the default statistical ranking). In case of
publication, the image description is the image legend, whereas
in the case of a web page, the speciﬁcally designed algorithm
retrieves the most appropriate description from the web page text
surrounding the image. Image publication date and source journal
are stored as separate ﬁelds that can also be used to sort the
results.

2.2 Quality evaluation

Out of the top 1012 pathways, 600 were randomly Chosen for expert
evaluation (see also Section 2 in Supplementary Material). We asked
six experts (each evaluating 100 different pathways/images) to tell
which pair of pathway image is Close or equivalent from the point of
View of a biological user. The recognized pathways were considered
Close/equivalent to its source image if the difference between them
was < 10% of the total number of objects and relations in the
pathway. In the experiments in which the experts made 600 similarity
assertions on different random pathways, the quality of recognition
was estimated as ~87%, i.e. 521/600 recognized pathways were
qualiﬁed as equivalent to its image by the experts.

For additional quality evaluation and community assessment,
every pathway in the repository has a ‘Like/Don’t Like’ option
button (Fig. 21) and a Report Form for the user’s opinion and to
leave comments on the quality of the pathway. This feedback will
be used in reﬁning our data mining and integration methods.

2.3 Data access

The constantly growing ‘Imaging Pathways’ repository currently
contains 1012 pathways. To access ‘Imaging Pathways’ repository,
run BiologicalNetworks integrated environment and open Pathway
Data Panel on the left (Fig. 1). The pathways recognized from
imaging data are under ‘Imaging Pathways’ node in the pathways
data tree. An example of NF-KB signaling pathway (Fig. 2) and
related data are also accessible upon launching the program from the
Welcome Screen (Click on the ‘Imaging Pathways’ demo project).
Additionally, BiologicalNetworks’ back-end database IntegromeDB
integrates Reactome, KEGG, BioCarta, NCI-Nature pathways,

the richest compendium of integrated pathways.

2.4 Functionality

‘Imaging Pathways’ can be explored in conjunction with public
knowledge and experimental data (Fig. 2) collected in the
BiologicalNetworks’ back-end database, IntegromeDB, for a variety
of species from > 100 data sources (Baitaluk et (11., 2010).
BiologicalNetworks allows the building of integrative models
starting from a given pathway (Fig. 2A, A’, B and B’) exploring
gene/protein (Fig. 2G) and interaction/relation (Fig. 2H) properties,
interaction networks (Fig. 2D and F), microarrays and other
experimental data (e.g. transcriptomic, metabolomic, proteomic)
(Fig. 2E), functional sequences, drugs, tissues, developmental stages
and other types of data (Kozhnekov et (11., 2010).

Users can start with a simple search over the pathway repository
from the Quick Search bar located above the Pathway Data Panel
(Fig. 1, left) for pathways, gene/protein descriptions and other
metadata. For example, searching ‘p53’ in the current pathway
collection produces only 14 results when run over ﬁgure caption
text (as most of the current search engines do), but returns 68 results
if analyzing information embedded in the image itself (Fig. 1). The
search results can be viewed either in a tree list View or in a grid
View (Fig. 1), which is especially useful for seeing commonalities
among topics, such as all the pathways that include a given gene,
or seeing all pathways/images of embryo development of some
species. Text description as well as source image together with image
caption, references to PubMed articles and links to source web pages
are provided for every pathway (Fig. 1). The ‘Similar Pathways’
Window/Tab (Fig. 2D) shows pathways having the highest number
of common objects (gene, proteins, etc.) with the opened pathway.
Advanced functionality on pathways exploration is described in
the Supplementary File and Video Tutorial (Demo #5, ‘Pathway
Collection’) on the BiologicalNetworks main page.

3 DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK

The compendium of pathways is constantly growing, and thus we
will be adding more pathways into compendium. We estimate that
the total size of pathway imaging data available in the PubMed
and W is at least ~100 times bigger than what we have
currently processed. We will be adding additional data types such as
miRNA to our list of recognized object types and will integrate
pathways repository with a gene regulatory modules discovery
tool available in BiologicalNetworks to enable exploration and
discovery of regulatory regions and regulatory modules using
canonical pathway enrichment tool. We will also maintain accuracy
by high-level curation of our pathways. We plan to extend image
and accompanying metadata search. Our text and object recognition
methods will be reﬁned to include other types of pathways (e.g.
biochemical reactions, high-level cellular processes) and derive
the relation direction and type. We will improve the database’s
check/verify procedures by clustering and comparison of similar
or relative pathways to ﬁnd doubtﬁil components.

Additional improvements of the system will include: (i) ﬁirther
examination of the images for the potentially novel interactions; (ii)
using NLP technology to decipher abbreviations used in the image
by reference to the ﬁgure legend or an external synonyms table
and usage of the ﬁgure legend in case when objects are labeled
by numbers; (iii) using NLP technology to decipher color-coded
information (see Section 8 in Supplementary Material).

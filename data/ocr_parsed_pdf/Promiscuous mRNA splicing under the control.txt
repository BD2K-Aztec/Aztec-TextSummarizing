Abstract

Motivation: The expression of tissue—restricted antigens (TRAs) in the thymus is required to ensure
efficient negative selection of potentially auto—reactive T lymphocytes and avoid autoimmune dis—
ease. This promiscuous expression is underthe control of the autoimmune regulator (AIRE), a tran—
scription factor expressed in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs). Tissue—specific alternative
splicing may also produce TRAs but the extent to which splice isoforms that are restricted to spe—
cific tissues are expressed in mTECs is yet to be investigated.

Results: We reanalyzed microarray and RNA—Seq datasets from mouse mTECs and other epithelial
and non—epithelial cell types and found that the diversity of splice isoforms in mTECs was greater
than in any of the other cell types or tissues studied. We identified tissue—specific isoforms from a
panel of mouse tissues and found several examples of such isoforms that are expressed in mTECs.
The number of isoforms with restricted expression found in mTECs was significantly higher than for
comparable cell types. Furthermore, we found evidence that AIRE influences the increased splicing
diversity observed in mTECs as the genes for which tissue restricted isoforms are produced in
mTECs were significantly more likely than other genes to be differentially spliced between AIRE
knock—out and wild—type samples. Our results suggest that developing T lymphocytes are exposed to
diverse tissue—restricted splice isoforms in the thymus and that AIRE has a direct or indirect role in
this process, representing a novel aspect of its role in the maintenance of immune self—tolerance.

1 Introduction

 

T lymphocytes are cells of the adaptive immune system that are cap—
able of recognizing and binding foreign peptides presented on the
surface of other cells by major histocompatibility (MHC) class mol—
ecules. Recognition is mediated by the T cell receptor (TCR), a
surface bound receptor, generated by a stochastic process of gene—
rearrangement during T cell development in the thymus. This som—
atic rearrangement results in a diverse repertoire of T cells, each
expressing a single TCR that is capable of recognizing a limited set
of peptide—MHC complexes. However, given the stochastic process
by which these TCRs are generated, the possibility arises that a TCR

may show an affinity for self—peptide—MHC complexes, leading to
an autoimmune response. To avoid this, T cells undergo a process of
selection in the thymus, whereby the developing T cell is exposed to
a range of self—peptide—MHC complexes. This process, referred to as
negative selection, results in the deletion from the T cell repertoire
of cells with high affinity for self—peptide—MHC complexes (Klein
et (11., 2009).

The range of self—peptides to which the developing T cells are
exposed includes a number of peptides that are normally only
expressed in specific tissues outside the thymus. This ectopic expres—
sion of tissue—restricted antigens (TRAs), which helps to prevent

autoimmune responses targeted against TRAs, is mediated by the
autoimmune regulator (AIRE), a transcription factor expressed pri—
marily in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs; Anderson et (11.,
2002). AIRE induces the expression of tissue restricted genes in
mTECs, and mutations in Aire lead to autoimmune polyendocrinop—
athy candidiasis ectodermal dystrophy (APECED), an autoimmune
disease which affects multiple endocrine organs (Peterson et (11.,
2004). Although AIRE has been shown to increase the level of
spliced versus un—spliced mRNAs (Zumer et (11., 2011), little is
known about the impact of AIRE on alternative splicing, and the ex—
tent to which it can cause expression of alternative splice isoforms,
resulting in isoform—specific TRA expression in the thymus. Previous
work has shown that AIRE interacts with a number of proteins
involved in pre—mRNA processing and spliceosome binding
(Abramson et (11., 2010), including splicing factors such as SC35, an
SR protein involved in transcriptional elongation through the re—
cruitment of the positive transcription elongation factor b (p—TEFb;
Lin et (11., 2008), and in the commitment of pre—mRNAs to the splic—
ing pathway (Fu, 1993). AIRE can also interact directly with
p—TEFb (Oven et (11., 2007). A mutation in the transcription activa—
tion domain (TAD) of AIRE, found in APECED patients, can
prevent this interaction, leading to a decrease in the level of spliced
versus un—spliced mRNAs (Abramson et (11., 2010; Zumer et (11.,
2011). In order to ensure efficient negative selection, a diverse range
of peptides needs to be presented in the thymus to developing T
cells. This includes peptides that are introduced by alternative splic—
ing (Klein et (11., 2000), specifically TRAs resulting from tissue—
specific alternative splicing.

To investigate the diversity of alternative splicing in the thymus,
we calculated splicing entropy (Ritchie et (11., 2008) using existing
RNA—Seq data from mTECs and compared it with the splicing en—
tropy of other tissues. Entropy can be considered as a measure of un—
certainty, and splicing entropy reﬂects the diversity of observed
splice isoforms in a given sample. We also compared mRNA splicing
between wild—type and knock—out mTECs. Finally, we investigated
the ectopic expression of tissue—specific splice isoforms in mTECs.
We suggest that AIRE plays a role in promiscuous splicing in
mTECs, resulting in the expression of TRAs in the thymus for the
purpose of negative selection of T cells. This is likely to contribute
to the role of AIRE in inducing tolerance to self—antigens.

2 Methods
2.1 Splicing entropy

Splicing entropy is a measure of the diversity of observed transcript
isoforms in a given sample. Ritchie et al. (2008) used splicing en—
tropy to measure splicing disorder using isoform expression values
obtained from expressed sequence tag (EST) data. Here, we used
isoform expression values calculated using RNA—Seq data. Splicing
entropy was calculated for each gene G, as

g
—ZP,-log2(P,-) (1)
i:1

where g is the number of isoforms that make up G, and P,- is the pro—
portion that each isoform 1' contributes to the overall expression of G.
We calculated this for each sample independently and summarized
each sample using the median splicing entropy value obtained.

2.2 Microarray data analysis
Affymetrix MoGene 1.0 ST microarray data from AIRE wild—type
and knock—out mTECs, generated by Giraud et al. (2012), was

downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under ac—
cession GSE33 878. This microarray platform contains probesets tar—
geting individual exons, allowing for exon level splicing analysis.
Detected above background (DABG) probabilities and exon level
expression estimates were calculated with Affymetrix Power Tools
using the probe logarithmic intensity error (PLIER) algorithm with
GC background correction. Unexpressed genes were removed from
the dataset. A gene was considered expressed if over 50% of its pro—
besets could be detected with a DABG P—value < 0.05 in over 50%
of all samples. Genes with single probesets were discarded. We
applied the alternative splicing robust prediction based on entropy
method (ARH) (Rasche and Herwig, 2010), to detect differences in
splicing between experimental conditions.

2.3 RNA—Seq data analysis
We downloaded RNA—Seq data generated by St—Pierre et al. (2013;
GEO accession GSE44945). This data consisted of paired—end se—
quences from mTECs as well as from cortical thymic epithelial cells
(cTECs) and skin epithelial cells (sECs). Raw reads were processed
using Trimmomatic v0.30 (Bolger et (11., 2014) to remove low—
quality sequences. These were then mapped to the mouse genome
(mm9) with TopHat v1.4.1 (Trapnell et (11., 2009) using default par—
ameters and RefSeq transcript expression levels were calculated with
Cufﬂinks v1.3.0 (Trapnell et (11., 2010) using the following param—
eters (—multi—read—correct —min—isoform—fraction 0). Genes with only
one annotated isoform were discarded from further analysis.
Splicing entropy was then calculated for each gene. Bootstrap ana—
lysis of the splicing entropy distribution was conducted in R v3.0.1.
To compare splicing entropy across different tissues, we used the
mouse 9—tissue dataset generated by Merkin et al. (2012; GEO ac—
cession GSE41637). These RNA—Seq datasets contain reads of vary—
ing lengths. For comparability across experiments, all reads were
trimmed to a maximum length of 50 bp before mapping to the
mouse genome with TopHat using the following parameters (—mate—
inner—dist 200 —mate—std—dev 30). RefSeq transcript abundances
were calculated with Cufﬂinks and splicing entropy was then calcu—
lated for each gene.

2.4 Tissue—specific alternative splicing

We used the nine—tissue dataset from Merkin et al. (2012) to identify
tissue—specific splice isoforms. An isoform 1, of a gene G, was con—
sidered to be specific to a tissue, if the proportion of transcripts
from G corresponding to I was significantly >0.1 in all replicates of
that tissue and in no replicate of any other tissue. Expression of an
isoform, as a proportion of gene expression, was considered to be
significantly greater if the lower bound of the 95% confidence inter—
val for the isoform proportion exceeded 0.1. In order to avoid
including tissue—specific genes, we considered only genes with frag—
ments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM)
>0.5 in more than one of the tissues examined.

3 Results and discussion

3.1 Splicing entropy in mTECs compared with other cell
types

The thymic epithelium creates a specialized environment that sup—
ports the development and maturation of T lymphocytes. This pro—
cess involves interactions of developing lymphocytes with epithelial
cells in the medulla and cortex of the thymus, called mTECs and
cTECs, respectively. These cell types arise from a common bi—potent
progenitor cell (Rossi et (11., 2006), but assume distinct roles in T cell

development (Anderson and Takahama, 2012). At a mature stage of
development, mTECs express AIRE, a transcription factor that in—
duces TRA expression in the thymic medulla (Anderson et al.,
2002). We hypothesized that there may exist a mechanism to ex—
press tissue—restricted splice isoforms in mTECs, to ensure negative
selection of T cells that react to TRAs resulting from tissue—specific
splicing. A prediction of this hypothesis is that thymic epithelial cells
should express a diverse set of splice isoforms, including isoforms
that are normally restricted to specific tissues. To investigate this
prediction we calculated splicing entropy based on previously pub—
lished RNA—Seq data (St—Pierre et al., 2013) from mouse mTECs,
cTECs and sECs, the latter being an example of a non—thymic epi—
thelial cell type. Only genes that were expressed in all three cell—
types and for which more than one annotated isoform was available
were considered for the calculation of splicing entropy. We found
that the median splicing entropy across genes was higher in the
mTEC than in the cTEC and sEC samples (P: 1 X 10 T 36,
P: 6 X 10756, respectively, Wilcoxon signed—rank test; Fig. 1A and
B). It should be noted that just one sample was available per cell
type and the statistical significance reported here reﬂects consistency
in the differences in splicing diversity across genes, rather than repli—
cation in multiple samples. Interestingly, the difference in splicing
entropy was more apparent for AIRE—induced genes [as identified by

(Supplementary Table S1), which is suggestive of a role for AIRE in
the diverse splicing output of mTECs.

We next compared thymic epithelial cells to a range of non—
epithelial cell types using data from nine mouse tissues from Merkin
et al. (2012). This dataset contains RNA—Seq samples from brain,
colon, heart, kidney, liver, lung, skeletal muscle (SkM), spleen and
testes. For each tissue, three samples (denoted mouse A, B and C)
were available, with the exception of heart for which only two sam—
ples were available. Each sample originates from a different mouse
strain (DBA/2], C57BL/6 and CD1 for samples A, B and C, respect—
ively). Differences in alternative splicing have been observed across
mouse strains (Su et al., 2008), which may contribute to some of
the differences in splicing entropy observed across samples from
the same tissue. The median (across genes) of the splicing entropy
in mTECs was higher than for any of the tissues examined and
for all samples, except for one of the mouse brain samples
(Mouse_B_Brain) the difference was highly statistically significant
(P < 0.0001 for all pair—wise comparisons, other than Mouse_
B_Brain for which P:0.19; Wilcoxon signed—rank test; Fig. 1C).
Although based on a single available sample of mTECs these results
suggest that mTECs express a wider range of isoforms compared
with other cell types. This is consistent with the proposal that tissue—
restricted splice isoforms are produced in the thymus and presented
to T cells for the purpose of negative selection. The absence of a

particular isoform gives rise to the potential for T cells capable of
directing auotimmity towards that isoform to escape the thymus,
causing autoimmunity.

3.2 AIRE plays a role in alternative splicing in mTECs

To measure directly the impact of AIRE on alternative splicing, we
applied the ARH method (Rasche and Herwig, 2010) to AIRE
knock—out and wild—type mTECS, using microarray data obtained
from Giraud et al. (2012). These data were generated using the
Affymetrix MoGene 1.0 ST array platform, which contains probe—
sets targeting individual exons. Genes that were either not expressed
or to which only one probeset was mapped were removed prior to
calculation of ARH values. We found that 4572 genes show differ—
ences in alternative splicing between AIRE knock—out and wild—type
mTECs with an ARH P value<0.05 (Supplementary Table S2).
Interestingly, this list of genes was significantly enriched for genes
with tissue—restricted isoforms that are expressed in mTECs
(P:0.01, from logistic regression, with gene expression level and
the number of expressed isoforms as covariates). We also counted
the number of exons detected in each sample. An exon was con—
sidered detected if it was assigned a DABG P—value<0.05. The
mean number of exons detected per expressed gene was significantly
higher for the wild—type samples than for the AIRE knock—out sam—
ples (P20.04, two sided t—test; Table 1). Together, these results
show that AIRE inﬂuences alternative splicing in mTECs, increasing
the number of exons detected in AIRE wild—type compared with
knock—out, consistent with a role for AIRE in the diverse splicing
output of mTECs. Although AIRE has previously been shown to in—
crease the level of spliced versus un—spliced mRNAs (Zumer et al.,
2011), a role for AIRE in alternative splicing has not been estab—
lished. Here we show that AIRE plays a role in alternative splicing
and increases the inclusion of exons, and therefore isoforms contain—
ing these exons and this is likely to be an aspect of the role of AIRE
in negative selection.

3.3 Ectopic expression of tissue—specific isoforms in
mTECs

Given that alternative splicing can give rise to tissue—specific iso—
forms (Xu et al., 2002), we asked if ectopic expression of tissue—spe—
cific isoforms could be detected in mTECs. We identified a set of
339 tissue—specific isoforms using the nine mouse tissue dataset
(Merkin et al., 2012; see Supplementary Table S3 for the list of all
detected TS isoforms). Of these, 72 were also expressed in mTECs,
compared to 26 in cTECs and 21 in sECs (P22 X 10’7 and
P: 3 X 1079, respectively, for the comparison of the proportion of
tissue—specific isoforms expressed in mTECs to the proportions in
cTECs and sECs, respectively; two—proportion z—test; Fig. 2A; see
Supplementary Table S4—S6 for TS isoforms detected in mTECs,
cTECs and sECs, respectively). We found that 50 tissue—specific

isoforms were expressed in the mTEC sample and not in either of
the cTEC or sEC samples. These represented tissue—specific splice
isoforms from eight of the nine tissues examined. This is compared
with three tissues represented in all tissue—specific isoforms detected
in sECs (Fig. 2B). We found that the range of tissue—specific isoforms
expressed in mTECs represents almost all of the tissues studied. This
is consistent with previous findings that mTECs express a diverse
range of tissue—restricted genes which represent most tissues of the
body (Derbinski et al., 2005). The tissue—specific isoforms that were
found in mTECs and not in cTECs or sECs included the long form
of the gene Oxrl (Fig. 3A), which is known to undergo brain—spe—
cific alternative splicing (Wakamatsu et al., 2009). The Oxrl gene
was expressed across all samples (Fig. 3B) but the long form of
Oxrl, NM_001130166, was expressed only in brain and in mTECs
(Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S1). We also found that mTECs ex—
press a tissue—specific splice isoform of sperm associated antigen 16
(Spag16). An alternative splice isoform of Spag16 has been identi—
fied as a B cell autoimmune target in multiple sclerosis (Bock et al.,
2014). It has been found that isoform—specific regions of autoanti—
gens that undergo alternative splicing often encode MHC class I and
II restricted epitopes (Ng et al., 2004), and therefore Spag16 may
also represent a T cell target in autoimmune disease. The ectopic ex—
pression of tissue—specific isoforms is likely to contribute to negative
selection, by providing an additional source of TRAs in the thymus.
The importance of TRAs for this purpose is well established; how—
ever, previous studies have focused on TRAs derived from tissue—
restricted genes (Derbinski et al., 2001). Promiscuous splicing may
be an important factor in establishing T cell tolerance to tissue—
specific isoforms. Experimental validation would be required to
formally show that T cells which are specific to isoform—specific pep—
tides do escape the thymus and cause autoimmunity in the absence
of AIRE and confirm our conclusion that AIRE introduces isoform—
specific TRAs for the purpose of negative selection.

4 Conclusion

It is well established that AIRE induces the expression of tissue re—
stricted genes in the thymus. Here, we show that AIRE also inﬂu—
ences alternative splicing in mTECs, increasing the number of exons
detectable per gene and allowing antigens on these exons to be pro—
duced. mTECs express a range of tissue—specific splice isoforms and
knock—out of AIRE affects splicing of the genes for which tissue—
restricted splice isoforms are found in mTECs. We suggest that pro—
miscuous splicing in mTECs is under the control of AIRE, and that a

breakdown in this mechanism would result in the absence of
isoform—specific TRAs in the thymus, allowing T cells capable of dir—
ecting autoimmunity towards tissue—specific isoforms to escape the
thymus and contribute to autoimmine disease.

ABSTRACT

Summary: The accurate prediction of protein folding rate change
upon mutation is an important and challenging problem in protein
folding kinetics and design. In this work, we have collected
experimental data on protein folding rate change upon mutation
from various sources and constructed a reliable and non-redundant
dataset with 467 mutants. These mutants are widely distributed
based on secondary structure, solvent accessibility, conservation
score and long-range contacts. From systematic analysis of these
parameters along with a set of 49 amino acid properties, we have
selected a set of 12 features for discriminating the mutants that
speed up or slow down the folding process. We have developed a
method based on quadratic regression models for discriminating the
accelerating and decelerating mutants, which showed an accuracy
of 74% using the 10-fold cross-validation test. The sensitivity and
specificity are 63% and 76%, respectively. The method can be
improved with the inclusion of physical interactions and structure-
based parameters.

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein folding is a process by which a polypeptide chain of
amino acid residues folds into a speciﬁc 3D structure. The rate of
protein folding is a measure to understand the tendency of folding
(slow/fast) from unfolded state to its native 3D structure, and it
varies several orders of magnitude, ranging from microseconds to an
hour (Bogatyreva et al., 2009; Fulton et al., 2005; Jackson, 1998).
Studies of protein folding rates enhance our understanding of the
variations in protein folding kinetics, which may lead to several
pathologies such as prion and Alzheimer’s diseases. Hence, several
investigations have been carried out to measure protein folding
rates, and the data are accumulated in different databases, such
as protein folding database (PFD; Fulton et al., 2005) and protein
folding kinetics database, kineticDB (Bogatyreva et (11., 2009).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

These databases provide annotated structural, methodological,
kinetic and thermodynamic data of proteins and mutants.

Currently, experimental data for protein folding rates are available
for less than 100 proteins, which demand the necessity of
computational methods to predict protein folding rates from 3D
structures of proteins and/or just from amino acid sequence. Plaxco
et al. (1998) proposed the ﬁrst method based on contact order
to relate protein folding rates with the total number of contacts
in protein structures. Gromiha and Selvaraj (2001) introduced the
concept of long-range order, which relates long-range contacts
(LRC, contact between two residues that are close in space and
far in the sequence) in protein structures with protein folding rate.
Consequently, several parameters such as total contact distance
(Zhou and Zhou, 2002), cliquishness (Micheletti, 2003), multiple
contact index (Gromiha, 2009), etc. have been developed to
understand protein folding rates using 3D structures of proteins.

On the other hand, several methods have been proposed
for predicting protein folding rates from amino acid sequence
with/without the structural class information. These methods include
the relationship with amino acid properties (Gromiha, 2003;
Gromiha, 2005; Gromiha et (11., 2006; Huang and Tian, 2006),
predicted secondary structures (SSs) (Ivankov and Finkelstein,
2004), predicted inter-residue contacts (Punta and Rost, 2005),
amino acid composition (Ma et al., 2006; Huang and Gromiha,
2008), SS length (Huang et al., 2007a) and hybrid sequence
representation (Jiang et al., 2009). Gromiha and Selvaraj (2008)
reviewed the details of computational methods for predicting protein
folding rates.

All the above mentioned studies are focused on predicting the
folding rates of proteins without any modiﬁcations of amino acids.
In fact, the substitution of amino acid residues in a protein drastically
alters the folding, stability, speciﬁcity and functions of proteins
(Gromiha et al., 1999a; Gromiha et al., 2009; Kumar and Gromiha,
2006; Lopez et (11., 2007; Porter et al., 2004; Prabakaran et al., 2001).
The problems related to protein stability and ﬁinction upon point
mutations have been addressed in earlier studies (Chea and Livesay,
2007; Gromiha, 2007; Holliday et al., 2009; Pugalenthi et al., 2008;
Sankararaman et al., 2010). Consequently, several methods have
been proposed to predict protein stability and ﬁinction due to amino
acid replacements (Bordner and Abagyan, 2004; Bromberg et al.,
2008; Capriotti et al., 2005; Carlsson et al., 2009; Cheng et al.,
2006; Dehouck et al., 2009; Gao et al., 2009; Guerois et al., 2002;
Huang and Gromiha, 2008; Huang and Gromiha, 2009; Yin et al.,
2007). However, the inﬂuence of amino acid mutations to protein

folding rates has not yet been explored. Hence, it is essential and
important to understand and predict protein folding rates upon amino
acid substitutions.

In this work, we have collected the experimental data on protein
folding rates upon point mutation and compiled a dataset. It
contains many mutants that are not included in PFD (Fulton et al.,
2005) and kineticDB (Bogatyreva et al., 2009), and the newly
compiled dataset would serve as a useful resource for further
studies. We have developed a method using quasi-regression models
and various features such as amino acid properties, SS, solvent
accessibility (SA), conservation score and LRC’s for discriminating
the effect of folding rates (increase or decrease; in other words,
accelerating or decelerating mutants). Our method showed an
accuracy of 74% using the 10-fold cross-validation test with a
speciﬁcity of 76% and sensitivity of 63% in a dataset of 467
mutants. We have developed a web server for distinguishing
the accelerating and decelerating mutants and it is available at
http://bioinformatics.myweb.hinet.net/freedom.htm.

2 METHODS

2.1 Protein mutant dataset

In this work, we have originally constructed a dataset (F467) of protein
mutants with experimental kf values and relevant features. The detailed
information about the mutants is given in Supplementary Table Sl. F467
consists of 467 unique mutants from 15 different proteins. Most of the
proteins have 15 to 68 mutants and the number of mutants in each protein
is shown in Supplementary Figure $1. The data were obtained from the
careful search of published reports in the literature as well as from two
freely accessible kinetic databases, PFD (Fulton et al., 2005) and kineticDB
(Bogatyreva et al., 2009). The original references for all the mutants in F467
dataset are listed in Supplementary Table S2.

F467 is obtained with the following conditions: (i) all single mutants,
(ii) kinetic type two; and (iii) kf values are extrapolated to zero concentration
(i.e. water). The folding rate change upon single mutation is calculated
by Akfzkfmam—kfild, where kmulam and kwild are kf values for mutant
and wild-type residues, respectively. The Akf ranges between —1193.60/s
and 1481.34/5, and the number of accelerating and decelerating mutants
is 79 and 338, respectively. It may be noted that some mutants cause
aggregation/precipitation and the proteins may not fold at all. Under these
circumstances, the protein folding kinetic databases miss the data on protein
folding rates upon mutations. Such data are not considered in the present
study.

2.2 SS and SA

SS and SA are important parameters to predict protein mutant stability and
binding sites in protein complexes (Gromiha et al., 1999b). We have utilized
these parameters in the present work and we obtained the information for all
the wild type residues from the Dictionary of SS of Proteins (DSSP; Kabsch
and Sander, 1983).

2.3 LRC

The residues in a protein molecule are represented by their oz-carbon atoms.
Using the C0, coordinates, a sphere of radius 8 A is ﬁxed around each residue
and the residues occurring in this volume are identiﬁed. The composition of
surrounding residues is analyzed in terms of the location at the sequence level
and the contributions from :l:3 to :l:4 residues as medium range contacts and
more than :l:4 residues are treated as LRCs (Gromiha and Selvaraj, 1997;
Gromiha and Selvaraj, 2004).

2.4 Conservation score

We have used the program Scorecons for computing the conservation
score for all the mutants in the considered proteins (Valdar, 2002). The
target sequence has been searched against non-redundant protein sequences
deposited in SWISS-PROT 57.0 (Boutet et al., 2007) using BLAST (Altschul
et al., 1990). We have used the default parameters (BLOSUM62 and the
threshold of 10) for BLAST search. Using the results obtained with BLAST,
we have performed multiple sequence alignment with MAFFT program
(Katoh et al., 2005). The aligned sequences have been utilized to compute
the conservation score for all the amino acid residues.

2.5 Amino acid properties

We used a set of 49 diverse amino acid properties (physicalichemical,
energetic and conformational), which fall into various clusters analyzed by
Tomii and Kanehisa (1996). The amino acid properties (i.e. vector p) were
normalized between 0 and 1 using the expression

a: Pgri_Pmin (1)
pmax_pmin7
where p” and pgri are the normalized and original property vectors,
respectively, of amino acid a; and pmin and pmax the minimum and
maximum vectors, respectively, for each property. The numerical and
normalized values for all the 49 properties used in this study along
with their brief descriptions have been explained in our earlier articles
(Gromiha et al., 1999c; Gromiha et al., 2000) and are available at
http://www.cbrc.jp/~gromiha/fold_rate/property.html.
The average property value of a segment in a protein sequence, pave, was
computed using the standard formula

ZPi

Pave = " . (2)
r

 

where p, is the property vector of i-th residue and the summation is over r,
the total number of residues in the segment.

2.6 Quadratic regression models

Regression models are prediction methods, which establish the relationship
between input and output variables by the polynomial equation. In this study,
we proposed regression models for discriminating folding rate change by a
quadratic form

17 17

p
y=b0+zbm+zzbjkxjxk+a (3)

1:1 1:1 kzj

where y is the output variable of folding rate change; 110, b]- and bjk are
regression coefﬁcients; Xi and xk the relevant features; [7 the total number
of features; uncontrolled factors and errors are modeled by 2. Given n
independent observations (xl , yl ), . . ., (x”, y”), the model becomes an n-by-m
system of equations

y] fl(xl)  fm(xl) Cl 31
2 = 2  2 2 + 2 ~ W
Y” f1(X")  fm(xn) Cm en

where yg is the output variable value of folding rate change for the g-th
(g=1,...,n) observation; xg=(xf,...,x§) the input vector of [7 variable
values for the g-th (g=1,...,n) observation; fh(xg) the h-th (h=1,...,m)
transferred term of the model (e.g. terms are f1(xl)=1, f2(xl)=xf and
f3(xl)=xé), and the value of m is calculated as m=1+p+[p(p+1)/2];
ch and eg the corresponding coefﬁcient and error values, respectively.
Therefore, the estimates of the model coefﬁcients are determined by using
the least-square method, which minimizes the statistics derived from errors.

Protein folding rate change upon point mutation

 

The present method has several main advantages of predicting folding
rate change. (i) The quadratic regression model (QRM) is a non-linear
but low-order model. Thus, it builds more complex and accurate models
using relatively few observations. (ii) The lower complexity of polynomial
equations is helpful to reduce computational cost and time. (iii) Further
inference can be carried out by well-known regression analysis.

2.7 Performance measurement

The discrimination of the folding rate change (accelerating / decelerating) can
be regarded as one of the binary classiﬁcation problems. Several measures
of prediction performance are regularly used for such classiﬁcations.

In this work, we have used overall accuracy (Q2), sensitivity (SE),
speciﬁcity (SP) and Matthews correlation coefﬁcient (MCC; Baldi et al.,
2000) for distinguishing the folding rate change of mutants. These measures
have been calculated by using the following expressions:

 

 

2 — TP+TN 10017 SE— 1007
Q _TP+FP+TN+FN X 0’ T TP+FN X 0’
= X 100%, and
TN+FP
TP >< TN + FP >< FN

 

 

C = ,
\/(TN+FN) >< (TN+FP) >< (TP+FN) >< (TP+FP)

where TP, TN, FF and FN refer to the number of true positives, true negatives,
false positives and false negatives respectively. Further, receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curves, which plot the true positive rate against the
false positive rate, are provided for showing the tradeoff between sensitivity
and speciﬁcity (Sonego et al., 2008). The area under the curve (AUC) is
calculated to summarize a curve in a single quantity.

We have carried out both jack-knife (leave-one-out cross-validation) and
n-fold cross-validation tests for validating the present method. J ack-knife test
systematically constructs the coefﬁcients of a prediction model by leaving
one-out observation at a time from the dataset, and then predicts the folding
rate change of the omitted mutant. For n-fold cross-validation test, the dataset
is divided into n subsets chosen randomly with approximately equal size. A
prediction model is built with n—l subsets of data and the remaining subset
of mutants is used for predicting the folding rate change. The procedure has
been repeated for n times to obtain the mean measure.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Distribution of mutants based on SA, conservation
score and LRCs

We have analyzed the distribution of protein mutants based on
various features used in the present study. The variation of SA for the
mutants in F467 dataset is shown in Supplementary Figure S2. We
noticed that the mutants are located at various ranges of SA. Most
of the mutants (47.8%) are located in buried/partially buried region
(SA<=20%) whereas the partially exposed (20% < SA§50%) and
exposed (SA> 50%) regions accommodate 32.8% and 19.5% of
mutants, respectively.

The analysis on LRCs shows that the mutants are widely
distributed with the normalized LRCs between 0 and 1
(Supplementary Fig. S3). The observed conservation score for all
the 467 mutants showed that the mutants are not populated with any
speciﬁc conservation score. On the other hand, the mutants are more
or less equally distributed between 0.3 and 1.0 with the intervals of
0.1 (Supplementary Fig. S4).

The systematic analysis of various features in all the mutants
used in the present study reveals that the dataset is not biased with

investigations on protein folding rates.

3.2 Discrimination of accelerating and decelerating
proteins upon point mutations

We have used various sequence and structure-based parameters and
QRMs for discriminating the accelerating and decelerating mutants.
The parameters wild type and mutant residues, 49 amino acid
properties, conservation score, SS, SA and LRCs have been used
as the initial set of parameters.

Further, these parameters have been optimized to obtain the
highest accuracy of discrimination with minimum number of
parameters. We have utilized genetic algorithm for feature selection
and the technical details are described in Supplementary Material.
The prediction performance with the increase of features is shown
in Figure 1. Interestingly, the combination of 12 selected features
showed the highest accuracy/MCC as well as the balance between
sensitivity and speciﬁcity for discriminating the accelerating and
decelerating mutants. It can also be seen from Figure 1 that a single
feature showed high speciﬁcity, whereas the sensitivity is poor. The
ﬁnal selected parameters are given in Table 1. The present method
utilizes only 12 parameters for discriminating 467 mutants. Among
49 amino acid properties 10 of them are used for discrimination
[El and AGph of wild type residue, El , -TASh and AH of mutant
residue, and average of MW, E1,NS, s and AG, unfolding Gibbs free
energy change (Oobatake and Ooi, 1993) for the three neighboring
residues on both directions].

Interestingly, the information on E1 (long-range non-bonded
energy) is used for wild type, mutant and neighboring residues,
showing the importance of long-range interactions for understanding
the folding rate change upon mutation.

We have analyzed the importance of each feature by computing
the discrimination accuracy without it. The results are shown in
Supplementary Table S3. Our result showed that the omission of a
single feature decreases the accuracy by 1—6% and speciﬁcally, the
parameters El and NS highly reduced the prediction accuracy.

Machine learning algorithms are commonly used for classifying
proteins based on their structure and function (Sonego et al.,
2007). The discrimination results obtained with the present method

as well as other widely used methods, support vector machines
(Chang and Lin, 2001), radial basis function networks (Moody

1986), and K* instance-based learner (Cleary and Trigg, 1995)
are presented in Table 2. Technical details of these methods are
described in Supplementary Material. We noticed that the present
method discriminated the accelerating and decelerating mutants with
an accuracy of 74% and 72% using the 10-fold cross-validation and
jack-knife tests, respectively. The sensitivity is 63% and 58% with
the speciﬁcity of 76% and 75%, respectively. It is noteworthy that
the speciﬁcity and sensitivity are close to each other and the average
is the balance between these two terms.

We have also analyzed the prediction performance of other
popular methods, such as neural networks, support vector machines,
radial basis function networks and k-nearest neighbors using the
same features. The results obtained with these methods indicated
that these machine learning methods are biased with high speciﬁcity
(86—100%), whereas the sensitivity is just 0—22%. Further, support
vector machines with various kernels predicted the mutants as
decelerating ones, the most abundant class in the dataset.

our method shows an AUC value of 0.71, whereas the AUC values
are 0.50, 0.54, 0.58 and 0.57 for support vector machines, neural
networks, radial basis ﬁinction networks and k-nearest neighbor
methods, respectively.

3.3 Prediction performance at different $85 and
various ranges of SA

We have analyzed the prediction accuracy at different SSs and
various ranges of SA, and the results are presented in Supplementary
Table S4. We noticed that the mutants at strand regions are better
predicted than those at helical and coil regions. It has been reported
that the neighboring residues inﬂuence the helical and coil segments,
whereas the strands are highly inﬂuenced with LRCs (Gromiha and
Selvaraj, 2004). Hence the inclusion of LRCs and the property, long-
range interaction energy enhanced the discrimination accuracy of
mutants at strands.

We have analyzed the inﬂuence of SA to discriminate the
decelerating and accelerating mutants. The inclusion of SA as a
feature did not improve the discrimination performance, and in
fact it decreased the accuracy by 3%. This result indicates that the
change of protein folding rates upon mutations did not depend on
the location of residues and the replacement of amino acid residues
at different locations may have similar effects on protein folding
rates.

The classiﬁcation of mutants based on SA is also included in
Supplementary Table S4. We noticed that the accuracy lies between
67% and 78% for the mutants in all the regions. Further, the mutants
in buried, partially buried and partially exposed regions are well
discriminated between accelerating and decelerating mutants. It is
noteworthy that the buried mutants are inﬂuenced with hydrophobic
interactions, whereas the exposed residues tend to form hydrogen
bonding, electrostatic and van der Waals interactions (Gromiha et al.,
1999b). The mutants in exposed regions are predicted with low
accuracy and sensitivity. The inclusion of all these interactions
may be necessary to correctly distinguish the accelerating and
decelerating mutants in exposed regions.

3.4 Variation of conservation score and LRCs for
discriminating the accelerating and decelerating
mutants

We have analyzed the inﬂuence of LRCs and conservation score
for discriminating the mutants, which enhance or slow down the
folding process. The sensitivity, speciﬁcity, accuracy and MCC of
discrimination are given in Supplementary Table S5. We noticed
that the mutants with more number of LRCs and high conservation
score are well predicted with the accuracy in the range 75—80%.
In Figure 3, we plotted the relationship between conservation score
and LRCs with correctly/wrongly predicted mutants. We observed
that the mutants with high conservation (>06) and more number
of LRCs (>0.6) are correctly predicted with our model. Among the
55 mutants, 42 of them are correctly predicted with the accuracy of
76.4%. Further, the sensitivity of mutants with normalized LRCs of
>075 is 100%.

3.5 Inﬂuence of neighboring residues for
discriminating the accelerating and decelerating
mutants

We have analyzed the inﬂuence of neighboring residues for
discriminating the accelerating and decelerating mutants. The results
obtained for different window lengths are shown in Figure 4.

The inclusion of three neighboring residues for the features, MW,
E1, NS, A G and s showed the best performance in terms of sensitivity,
speciﬁcity, accuracy and MCC. The performance did not improve
with additional neighboring residues.

3.6 Examining the performance of the method

We have examined the performance of the prediction method with
two typical examples, barnase (lBNR, 1BNR*) and acyl coenzyme
protein (2ABD) with 19 and 30 mutants, respectively. These proteins
belong to a+ﬂ class of proteins. The mutants have wide range
of LRCs and the conservation scores lie between 0.3 and 1.0. We
have utilized our model and predicted the change of folding rate
upon mutation. We obtained the accuracy, sensitivity, speciﬁcity

and MCC 0f 90%, 100%, 88% and 0.72, respectively for the
protein lBNR, which has 16 decelerating and 3 accelerating mutants.
The folding rates of 2ABD mutants showed the presence of equal
number of accelerating and decelerating mutants. Our method could
distinguish the mutants with an accuracy of 73% (sensitivity, 0.73
and speciﬁcity, 0.73) and MCC of 0.47. The variation of conserved
scores and LRCs for these proteins are shown in Supplementary
Figure S5.

Further, we have analyzed the discrimination performance in
different mutation pairs (e.g. A to G and G to A). We observed that
ﬁve pairs of mutations have appreciable number of data (at least in
one pair) in the F467 dataset. The discrimination accuracy obtained
for all these ﬁve mutation pairs are presented in Supplementary
Table S6. Our method could discriminate the accelerating and
decelerating mutants with high accuracy in most of the considered
pairs. The only exception is the mutation of P to A, which showed
an accuracy of 50%. The mutation A to G with 26 data and V to A
with 54 data discriminated the accelerating and decelerating mutants
with an accuracy of 81% and 76%, respectively.

3.7 Discrimination on the web

We have developed a web server, FREEDOM (folding rate
changg prﬁiction using regressign models), for discriminating the
accelerating and decelerating mutants and it is freely available
at http://bioinformatics.myweb.hinet.net/freedom.htm. Figure 5a
shows the necessary input parameters (wild type, mutant and three
neighboring residues, normalized LRC and conservation score)
for predicting the folding rate change upon mutation for the
mutant D23A in 2CI2. FREEDOM utilizes QRMs and returns the
predicted results within a minute. The output (Fig. 5b) contains the
information about the input sequence and the predicted folding rate
change (accelerating or decelerating). In this example, FREEDOM
showed that the mutant accelerated the folding process, which is
in agreement with the experimental observation. Further, we have
included the characteristic features of wild type residue and three
neighboring residues in terms of composition, polarity and metabolic
role.

3.8 Merits, limitations and possible improvements

The present method is the ﬁrst one for discriminating the accelerating
and decelerating mutants. The compiled dataset from various
resources can be used for further analysis and prediction of protein
folding rates upon mutations. The present work is focused on
various amino acid properties, conservation score, SS, SA and LRCs.
The problem is similar to the prediction of protein stability upon
mutations (Gromiha, 2007). Hence, for the proteins with known 3D
structures, different interactions (Guerois et al., 2002) and potentials
(Dehouck et al., 2009; Parthiban et al., 2006) can be derived and
applied for predicting protein folding rates upon mutation. Further,
the method can be reﬁned with other sequence-based parameters
(Capriotti et al., 2005; Huang et al., 2007b). These sequence and
structure-based methods can be extended to predict the numerical
values for the changes in protein folding rates upon mutations in
addition to discrimination. The works on these directions are on
progress.

4 CONCLUSIONS

We have compiled the ﬁrst dataset for protein folding rates upon
amino acid substitutions. The mutants are located in various ranges
of SA, distributed in different SSs, accommodated in variable and
conserved positions, and connected with variety of LRCs. We have
utilized the information on conservation score and LRC along with
10 amino acid properties for discriminating the accelerating and
decelerating mutants.

Our method showed an accuracy of 74% with the sensitivity
and speciﬁcity of 63% and 76%, respectively. The method has
been implemented on a web server and the discrimination results
are available at http://bioinformatics.myweb.hinet.net/freedom.htm.

This is the ﬁrst method to discriminate the accelerating and
decelerating mutants and it can be reﬁned with the inclusion of
various physical interactions and predicting the changes in folding
rates quantitatively.

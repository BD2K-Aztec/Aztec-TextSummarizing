ABSTRACT

Motivation: Off-target interactions of a popular immunosuppressant
Cyclosporine A (CSA) with several proteins besides its molecular
target, cyclophilin A, are implicated in the activation of signaling path-
ways that lead to numerous side effects of this drug.

Results: Using structural human proteome and a novel algorithm for
inverse ligand binding prediction, ILbind, we determined a compre-
hensive set of 100+ putative partners of CSA. We empirically show
that predictive quality of ILbind is better compared with other available
predictors for this compound. We linked the putative target proteins,
which include many new partners of CSA, with cellular functions, ca-
nonical pathways and toxicities that are typical for patients who take
this drug. We used complementary approaches (molecular docking,
molecular dynamics, surface plasmon resonance binding analysis and
enzymatic assays) to validate and characterize three novel CSA tar-
gets: calpain 2, caspase 3 and p38 MAP kinase 14. The three targets
are involved in the apoptotic pathways, are interconnected and are
implicated in nephrotoxicity.

1 INTRODUCTION

First identiﬁed in 1972, Cyclosporine A (CSA) was purified from
the fungus Tolypocladium inﬂatum (Agathos et al., 1987). This
drug is primarily used an immunosuppressant to prevent rejection
in solid organ transplants (Tedesco and Haragsim, 2012). The
mechanism of action of CSA involves binding to its therapeutic
target cyclophilin A and forming a complex with calcineurin
(Tedesco and Haragsim, 2012). Cyclophilin A is a peptidylproly-
lisomerase located in the cytoplasm that is inhibited by binding of
CSA (Takahashi et al., 1989). Peptidylprolylisomerases are
involved in the isomerization of proline peptide bonds in oligo-
peptides and allow accelerated folding of a protein. Calcineurin
is a calcium/calmodulin—dependent serine/threonine protein

phosphatase that is speciﬁcally involved in the dephosphorylation
of transcription factors involved in signaling events, including nu-
clear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). The binding of CSA to
cyclophilin and calcineurin prevents the dephosphorylation of
NFAT, thwarting transit to the nucleus. NFAT is critical for ini-
tiation of promoters that stimulate the production and activation
of T cells; consequently, the immune response is shut down
(Tedesco and Haragsim, 2012). CSA is also used to treat several
disease states, including heart failure, psoriasis and rheumatoid
arthritis. Unfortunately, use of CSA is associated with severe side
effects, including nephrotoxicity, fibrosis, hepatotoxicity and car-
diotoxicity, and their mechanistic details remain unclear (Rezzani,
2004; Tedesco and Haragsim, 2012). CSA was shown to interact
with many proteins other than its molecular target, cyclophilin A.
These off-target interactions could be involved in the activation of
signaling pathways that lead to the undesirable symptoms, and
their knowledge could be exploited in other disease states. As a
few examples, CSA-induced nephrotoxicity involves renal tubular
dysfunction that is thought to result from a blockade of the mito-
chondria permeability transition pore component cyclophilin D
(Devalaraja—Narashimha et al., 2009). CSA also causes endoplas-
mic reticulum (ER) stress by inhibiting the ER-localized cyclophi-
lin B (Lee et al., 2012) and indirectly activates other proteins, such
as TGF-ﬂ that is involved in ﬁbrosis (Wolf, 2006).

Motivated by the ubiquity of the proteiniCSA interactions, we
used inverse ligand binding predictions 0(ie et al., 2011) to com-
prehensively determine putative partners of CSA. This prediction
uses structures of a few proteiniligand (drug) complexes, in our
case, the available CSAwyclophilin complexes, to predict other
targets of CSA on the structural human proteome scale. The
predictions were generated with the ILbind method that was re-
cently shown to accurately ﬁnd distant targets (targets that have
structurally different folds compared with the proteins that are
known to interact with the given compound) for a diverse set of
>30 small organic ligands (Hu et al., 2012). Similar inverse ligand
binding-based approaches that used older predictors were used
to ﬁnd novel targets for other compounds, such as Comtan
(Kinnings et al., 2009), Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein
(CETP) inhibitors (Xie et al., 2009) and Raloxifene (Sui et al.,
2012). We empirically show that predictive performance of
ILbind is better when compared with other available predictors.
We assessed selected top-ranked putative partners of CSA in the

context of their involvement in the toxicity-related pathways, and
we focused on several targets that are potentially associated with
nephrotoxicity. We modeled their interactions with CSA using
docking and then veriﬁed their binding and changes in the cor-
responding enzymatic activity using in vitro assays.

2 METHODS

The datasets, methods related to computational modeling, experimental
analysis and evaluation protocols are described in the Supplementary
Material. Brieﬂy, we collected structures of protein£SA complexes
and used them to predict other protein targets of CSA in the structural
human proteome using ILbind. The top-ranked targets were analyzed
with Ingenuity platform, and their association with CSA was investigated
based on manual scanning of relevant publications. Three targets that are
involved in apoptotic pathways with links to nephrotoxicity were further
analyzed using docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and
were validated experimentally with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and
enzymatic assays.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Empirical evaluation of predictions

Predictions generated by ILbind were empirically compared
against predictions from other relevant approaches: SMAP
0(ie and Bourne, 2008) and FINDSITE (Brylinski and
Skolnick, 2008). Native targets of CSA were collected from mul-
tiple sources, including Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Berman et al.,
2000), BindingDB (Liu et al., 2007) and DrugBank (Knox et al.,
2011). Details of the assessment are explained in the
Supplementary Materials. First, we selected the best performing
(based on the AUtprlOO value) output of SMAP and FINDSITE,
which are raw score and identity score, respectively, to assess
their predictions. Using ILbind, we identiﬁed 38% of the
native targets of CSA in the top 0.3% of its predictions. The
last column in Table 1 shows that ILbind found all native targets
in the top 65% (66% when clustering proteins at 80%) of its
predictions, compared with the top 72% (73%) and 92% (96%)
of the predictions from SMAP and FINDSITE, respectively.
Table 1 also reveals that ILbind obtains higher predictive per-
formance (based on the area under the TPR curve, AUtpr, for
10, 20 and 100% of the top scoring predictions) compared with
the other two predictors. The corresponding absolute

improvements compared with the second best method are
modest at ~ 1% (relative improvements are 100% x (0.4470.43)/
0.43 = 2.3, 2.1 and 1.2% for AUtprlO, AUtpr20 and AUtprlOO,
respectively) and statistically signiﬁcant, except for the AUtpr100
measure.

We also performed a more detailed assessment of predictions
for the top 100 predicted targets from each method. We ex-
panded the annotation of the CSA targets collected from PDB,
BindingDB and DrugBank (direct targets) with the targets found
in articles from PUBMED (indirect targets). The indirect targets
were identified by PUBMED search using names of the drug and
a given putative target protein and assuming that the target inter-
acts with CSA if there is at least one article that links them
together using a meaningful association derived by reading the
full article; the results for ILbind are given in Supplementary
Table S1. Moreover, we included predictions performed using
molecular docking with AUTODOCK 4 (Osterberg et al.,
2002), motivated by popularity of this method (Sousa et al.,
2006). Because docking is computationally expensive, we limited
the scope to the top 100 targets predicted by ILbind, SMAP or
FINDSITE. Docking for each of these targets was repeated 40
times; we used the four representative CSA conformation col-
lected from the template targets (PDBid 3pmp_B, 2rmc_A,
1ikf_H and 2oju_A) to accommodate for ﬂexibility of this
drug, and we run each conformation 10 times to accommodate
for the randomization related to the use of a genetic algorithm in
AUTODOCK 4. The lowest docking energy over 40 runs was
used to score predictions from docking. We used the top 100
targets with lowest energies from the docking-based results to
perform assessment and then compared these results with the
top 100 targets generated by ILbind, SMAP and FINDSITE;
each set of the top 100 targets was clustered at 80% identity,
and we assessed the results for the corresponding clusters. The
TPRs of ILbind, AUTODOCK, SMAP and FINDSITE are
0.54 :l: 0.07, 0.45 :l: 0.05, 0.43 :l: 0.04 and 0.35 :l: 0.06, respectively.
This means that 54% (32 of 59) of the clusters in the top 100
targets predicted by ILbind are known to bind CSA; this rate is
significantly higher (based on the t—test) than the TPRs of the
other four methods (P<0.01).

3.2 Analysis of targets predicted with ILbind

We analyzed the putative CSAiprotein interactions provided
by ILbind and investigated whether these interactions could be

Characterization of Cyclosporine A targets

 

responsible for the side effects experienced by patients taking
CSA. We focused on the top 199 high-scoring targets generated
by ILbind; these targets and their annotations are available in
Supplementary Table S1. They were annotated as supported by
direct evidence of binding to CSA (based on PDB, BindingDB
and DrugBank) or indirect evidence (based on search in
PUBMED); otherwise they were annotated as having no prior
evidence of binding to CSA.

Supplementary Figure S5A shows the cumulative number of
putative targets in each of these three types of annotations and
their ILbind scores. The direct evidence exists for cyclophilins
and ILbind generated high scores for the corresponding top 42
cyclophilins and cyclophilin-like folds. We found 48 targets with
indirect evidence and another 109 targets that were annotated as
not being supported by evidence. The ILbind scores for these
targets were relatively high, >0.65, which was indicative of a
high likelihood of interaction. Supplementary Figure S5B,
which shows scores over the entire structural human proteome,
reveals that below the 0.65 cutoff, the ILbind scores plateau and
would be less useful to discriminate the off-targets from non-
binding targets. Overall, the results show that our top putative
targets include both conﬁrmatory and new results.

After removing similar proteins among the 199 targets, e. g. we
had multiple targets that included cyclophilin A domain, we per-
formed IPA analysis with Ingenuity release November 1 2012 for
111 targets of the 144 unique targets; the remaining 33 targets
were not recognized by Ingenuity. The results are summarized in
Table 2. The top canonical pathways are IL-17 signaling, acute
phase response signaling and dendritic cell maturation, all critical
for immune system activation, corresponding with the CSA’s
intended purpose. The top associated molecular and cellular
function is cell death and survival with 64 of the con-
sidered 111 targets being involved. We also found a wide range
of signiﬁcantly associated toxicities, including hepatotoxicity,
cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, each supported by over a
dozen of our putative CSA targets that are identiﬁed in
Supplementary Table S1. Supplementary Figure S6 provides a
detailed overview of the various types of heart, liver and kidney
toxicities and their association with the putative targets that we
identified. Each of the corresponding 14 toxicity types was con-
nected with at least seven targets and is associated with targets
that were categorized as having indirect and no prior evidence. In
short, we found that our putative targets of CSA are associated
with relevant pathways and cellular function and with several
types of toxicities that are observed in patients who take
this drug.

3.3 Analysis of interactions of CSA with CAPN2, CASP3
and MAPK14

We selected three putative targets that were identiﬁed by ILbind,
calpain 2 (CAPN2), caspase 3 (CASP3) and p38 mitogen—acti-
vated protein kinase 14 (MAPK14), to further characterize and
experimentally validate their interactions with CSA. This selec-
tion was motivated by our focus on targets that participate in the
apoptotic response seen with the CSA treatment (de Arriba et al.,
2013; Eckstein et al., 2005; Sato et al., 2011) and because enzym-
atic assays to monitor their binding and activity were readily
available. Our analysis shows that CAPN2, CASP3 and

MAPK14 are involved in renal, cardiac and liver necrosis
(Supplementary Fig. S6). These targets can be also linked to
each other Via the apoptotic pathway (Supplementary Fig. S7).
CAPN2 was identiﬁed to be involved in the regulation of the
apoptotic CASP3 by cleaving and reducing CASP3 activity and
potentially playing a protective role (Bizat et al., 2003). As apop-
tosis progresses, CASP3 becomes involved in degrading an en-
dogenous calpain inhibitor, calpastatin, leading to CAPN2-
dependent plasma membrane disruption and necrosis (Neumar
et al., 2003). Furthermore, direct linkage between CASP3 and
MAPK14 was found in human and rat cells (Alvarado-
Kristensson et al., 2004; McLaughlin et al., 2001). We hypothe-
sized that binding of CSA to these novel targets may trigger
apoptosis and account for the severity of some side effects of
this compound.

3.3.] Molecular docking We performed MD simulations to
model ﬂexibility of the drug molecule and the three target pro-
teins and docking with AUTODOCK 4 to provide putative

molecular-level details of the proteinidrug interactions (see
Supplementary Materials for details). In total, 300 docking simu-
lations (10 MD-generated conformations of CSA and 10 of each
of the 3 targets) were performed. These docking results were
ranked by their binding energies, and top 10 hits per target
were used as a starting point for an all-atom solvated MD simu-
lation to investigate stability and pose of CSA within the corres-
ponding binding pockets of each target. We repeated docking
using the molecular operating environment-induced ﬁt algorithm
(www.chemcomp/com) to validate AUTODOCK results.
Although there are relatively minor variations in the docking
results, the overall binding poses generated by the two methods
are similar for the three targets (Supplementary Fig. S8). We
focus on confirming that CSA binds these targets rather than
on providing precise binding modes.

The binding poses of CSA for the three targets generated with
AUTODOCK that correspond to the minimal docking energy
among the 10 simulations are shown in Supplementary Figure
S9. To compare, the binding poses for the four representative
positive controls (targets in complex with CSA), which were also
computed combining MD and docking, are in Supplementary
Figure S10. In spite of a limited ﬂexibility of the backbone of
the CSA peptide, its fairly ﬂexible side chains allowed it to adopt
distinctive conformations (Supplementary Fig. S4) and to have
different geometries in binding sites. The topologies of the bind-
ing sites for the positive controls ranged from a ﬂat and open
pocket where CSA circulates a hydrophobic protrusion
(Supplementary Fig. S10D) to a compact and closed pocket
where CSA is buried in a deep cleft (Supplementary Fig.
S10A). Similar binding poses are observed for the three putative
targets, where the interaction with MAPK14 (Supplementary
Fig. S9C) is characterized by the lowest docking energy. The
energies for CASP2, CAPN2 and MAPK14 are 740.5, 745.5
and 760.7kcal/mol, respectively. To compare, the docking ener-
gies of the positive controls are at 42.1 kcal/mol for FAB frag-
ment IGGl-kappa, 755.1 for Cyclophilin A, 760.4 for
Cyclophilin C and 760.9 for the cyclophilin-like protein. The
fact that the docking energies obtained for the putative targets
are similar to the energies obtained for the known targets sug-
gests that CSA may bind these putative targets.

3.3.2 SPR and enzymatic validation We performed SPR ana-
lysis for CAPN2, MAPK14 and CASP3 (Fig. 1), the positive
control, cyclophilin A, and the negative control, NF-kappa—B
(NFKB) (Supplementary Fig. S9). Our prior experience with
SPR showed that higher coupling amounts generate more non-
speciﬁc interactions for small molecules; thus, we monitored the
total coupling and limited it to <2500 relative units (RU). We run
a dilution series of CSA (8000, 4000, 2000, 1000, 500, 250, 125
and 0nM) in triplicate. Clinical use of CSA is usually between
100 and 1600 nM (Hauser, 1998) with this range covering most
clinical and physiological situations. Using BiaEvaluation, we
computed kinetic association and dissociation rate constants
and afﬁnity KD (Supplementary Table S2) to describe drugi
target complex formation and stability. We used speciﬁc enzym-
atic assays to monitor the effect of CSA on the enzymatic activity
of CAPN2, MAPK14 and CASP3 (Fig. 1), further validating the
CSA interactions and presenting a possible hypothesis regarding
the effect of CSA on cellular signaling events.

The positive control (ILbind score of 0.86) shows robust bind-
ing (Supplementary Fig. S11A) and strong kinetics. Our meas-
urements, with the average KD of 30 nM, 0.253 uM’ls’1
association rate and 6.6 x 10’3 s’1 dissociation rate
(Supplementary Table S2), are in agreement with previous
work where KD was in the range of 740 nM (Kawai et al.,
1998; Wear et al., 2005) and association and dissociation rates
were 0.86 uM’ls’1 and 10 x 10’3 s71, respectively (Wear and
Walkinshaw, 2006). The negative control NFKB (ILbind score
of 0.58) has no appreciable binding (Supplementary Fig. S1 1B),
and thus, kinetics could not be calculated; to the best of our
knowledge, NFKB has not been identiﬁed to interact with
CSA. These results show that SPR discriminates between posi-
tive and negative targets. The 0.58 score is low, as the ILbind
scores range between 0.32 and 0.86, with majority of them <0.65
(Supplementary Fig. S5B). NFKB is ranked 2312 among the
9652 considered proteins.

CAPN2 is a cytosolic member of calpain family that is activated
by intracellular calcium signaling and is involved in homeostasis
and apoptotic signaling (Smith and Schnellmann, 2012). SPR
shows a substantial increase in binding with the addition of
increasing concentrations of CSA (Fig. 1A). Using a luciferase-
based activity assay that measures enzymatic cleavage of a speciﬁc
substrate used by CAPN2, we found that CSA directly binds to
CAPN2 and affects its enzymatic cleavage activity in a significant
manner; a 40% increase in activity observed at the highest con-
centration of CSA (Fig. 1A). Calculation of activity constants and
curve fitting shows that CSA affects activity of CAPN2 in a quad-
ratic manner over a 2 log concentration of CSA (Fig. 1A).

MAPK14 is a central kinase that is involved in cellular signal-
ing and apoptosis (Wada and Penninger, 2004). Similar to
CAPN2, SPR indicates that CSA binds to MAPK14 at higher
CSA concentrations (Fig. 1B). Using a MAPK14-speciﬁc enzym-
atic activity assay that measures direct phosphorylation of a
MAPK14 substrate in the presence of different concentrations
of CSA, we show a 50% increase in the MAPK14 enzymatic
activity, which is approximated with a quadratic fit (Fig. 1B).

CASP3 is implicated in apoptosis and is one of the primary
caspases that is responsible for cellular damage (Slee et al., 1999).
We observe increasing binding of CSA to CASP3 with greater
concentrations of CSA (Fig. 1C). Using a luciferase-based en-
zymatic activity assay, we determined that CSA had a relatively
minor effect on CASP3 activity (Fig. 1C), i.e. ~ 10% increase in
activity with higher concentrations of CSA is found.

Interestingly, CAPN2, MAPK14 and CASP3 have similar
ILbind scores (0.67, 0.65 and 0.68, respectively; Supplementary
Table S1) and comparable SPR curves and RU values (Fig. 1).
Although the RU values are lower relative to the values observed
for cyclophilin A (Supplementary Fig. S11A), other studies that
considered similar small molecules showed comparably low RU
values to demonstrate binding (Du et al., 2006; Nordin et al.,
2005). Moreover, these lower values also reﬂect lower coupling
to the SPR sensor chip of these three proteins when compared
with cyclophilin A. The corresponding kinetic analysis
(Supplementary Table S2) reveals that CSA interacts with
these three targets, although not as strongly as with the cyclo-
philin A. We hypothesize that the physiological significance of
CSA binding to these off-target proteins should be relevant, as
some of the toxic side effects may be caused by these binding

Fig. 1. Puriﬁed enzyme activity measurements (on the left) and real-time sensorgrams (on the right) for the interaction of CSA with calpain 2 (CAPN2;
panel A), p38 (MAPK14; panel B) and caspase 3 (CASP3; panel C); see Supplementary Material for details. All measurements were done in triplicate,
and the corresponding averages are shown. The sensorgrams are at 8000, 4000, 2000, 1000, 500, 250, 125 and 0nM concentration of CSA using

Biacore 3000

events that we show affects the enzymatic properties of these
proteins. A more detailed discussion, which links these targets
to nephrotoxicity (Peyrou et al., 2007; Ramesh and Reeves, 2005)
that is observed in patients who take CSA, is provided in Section
5 in the Supplementary Material.

4 DISCUSSION

We performed a large-scale structural human proteome-wide
study to ﬁnd protein off-targets of CSA using state-of—the-art
computational method, ILbind. We empirically demonstrate
that predictions generated by ILbind offer good predictive per-
formance. We compiled a comprehensive list of 100+ putative
targets of this drug and then linked these targets with an assort-
ment of cellular functions, canonical pathways and toxicities,
which are typical for patients who take CSA. We used a com-
plementary arsenal of approaches, including ILbind, molecular
dynamics, molecular docking, SPR and enzymatic assays to iden-
tify and characterize in detail three novel targets of CSA. We
show that CSA likely binds to and may be an exogenous agonist
of CAPN2 and MAPK14, and that it also activates CASP3 but

to a lesser extent. A detailed discussion of the functional roles of
these interactions is provided in the Supplementary Materials.
Our study may also lead to new discoveries for a wide range of
toxic responses to CSA for which we found previously unknown
putative proteins targets. Moreover, our pipeline could be used
to provide insights into side effects and mechanisms of action of
other small molecule drugs that target proteins.

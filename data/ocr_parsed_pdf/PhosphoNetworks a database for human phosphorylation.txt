ProteinSearch provides detailed information about a query
protein. The information includes the list of upstream kinases
that phosphorylate the query protein as well as the MS/MS—
veriﬁed phosphorylation sites in the query protein. If the query
protein is a kinase, PhosphoNetworks also provides the list of
downstream substrates and the phosphorylation motif recog—
nized by the query protein. Left clicking the mouse on the
motif logo image will open another web page listing the
15mers surrounding the phosphorylated site that constitute
the Position Weight Matrix (PWM) of the motif. In addition,
the specific phosphorylation sites on its substrate proteins are
also provided. ProteinSearch accepts both the ofﬁcial gene
symbol names and aliases as the query input.

SiteSearch allows the user to search the MS/MS—veriﬁed phos—
phorylation sites in a query protein. In some cases, it will also
provide putative upstream kinase(s) that act on the phosphoryl—
ation site(s). To search MS/MS—veriﬁed phosphorylation sites,
we use Perl regular expression to find the hits from 70422
collected MS/MS—veriﬁed phosphorylation peptides. To predict
putative upstream kinases, we scan all possible phosphorylation
sites containing serine, threonine and tyrosine amino acids, score
them by PWM of all kinases, and then compare the scores with
the cutoffs computed from the human proteome. All sites with
scores larger than the cutoff are deﬁned as predicted phosphor—
ylation sites, and its upstream kinase is deﬁned as the one rep—
resented by the PWM.

PathSearch enables the user to do pathway analysis between a
pair of proteins. Given two protein names as input, PathSearch
will find the shortest phosphorylation path between them. If
more than one shortest path exists, all of them will be provided.
This function has been shown to be useful in ﬁnding the missing
links in known, but incomplete, signaling pathways. For
example, we have successfully used this approach to ﬁnd the
intermediate serine/threonine kinase PRKACA that connects a
tyrosine kinase, Bruton’s tyrosine kinase, and ARID3A, a pro—
tein known to be inﬂuenced by Bruton’s tyrosine kinase but
without known tyrosine phosphorylation site in it (Newman
et al., 2013).

NetworkSearch allows the user to perform network analysis
by querying a set of proteins. Given a group of protein names as
input, NetworkSearch will ﬁnd all direct neighbors of these pro—
teins and show the network composed by them in a scalable
vector graphics (SVG) figure. The template of NetworkSearch
is based on our previous MoReNet database (Hu et al., 2010). It
allows users to drag and move nodes in the network to get a
better topology. The users are also allowed to download gene
and gene pairs in the network in plain text format.

4 DISCUSSIONS

PhosphoNetworks database integrates two kinds of high—
throughput phosphorylation data, protein microarray—veriﬁed
KSRs and MS—veriﬁed phosphorylation sites. Relative to
other human phosphorylation—related databases, such as
Phospho.ELM (http://phospho.elm.eu.org/) (Dinkel et al.,
2011), PhosphoNetworks has three signiﬁcant merits. First, it
is a high—resolution phosphorylation network database, which
connects kinases not only to their downstream substrates but
also at specific phosphorylation sites on the substrates. Second,
it covers a far greater number of novel identiﬁed KSRs (24046
raw KSRs and 3656 reﬁned KSRs) and novel predicted phos—
phorylation motifs (300 motifs, over double that of the previous
knowledgebase). Finally, it provides some unique tools to make
it easier for the user to explore and analyze the data. For
example, the PathSearch function allows the user to find the
missing link in known incomplete pathways, and the
SiteSearch function allows the user to predict possible upstream
kinases of their interested proteins or peptides. We expect this
database will be valuable for proteomics and phosphorylation—
related disease research.

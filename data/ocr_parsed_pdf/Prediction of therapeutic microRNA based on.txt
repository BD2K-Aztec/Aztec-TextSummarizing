ABSTRACT

Motivation: MicroRNA (miRNA) expression has been found to be
deregulated in human cancer, contributing, in part, to the interest of
the research community in using miRNAs as alternative therapeutic
targets. Although miRNAs could be potential targets, identifying which
miRNAs to target for a particular type of cancer has been difficult due
to the limited knowledge on their regulatory roles in cancer. We ad-
dress this challenge by integrating miRNA-target prediction, metabolic
modeling and context-speciﬁc gene expression data to predict thera-
peutic miRNAs that could reduce the growth of cancer.

Results: We developed a novel approach to simulate a condition-
specific metabolic system for human hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) wherein overexpression of each miRNA was simulated to pre-
dict their ability to reduce cancer cell growth. Our approach achieved
>80% accuracy in predicting the miRNAs that could suppress metas-
tasis and progression of liver cancer based on various experimental
evidences in the literature. This condition-specific metabolic system
provides a framework to explore the mechanisms by which miRNAs
modulate metabolic functions to affect cancer growth. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first computational approach implemented
to predict therapeutic miRNAs for human cancer based on their func-
tional role in cancer metabolism. Analyzing the metabolic functions
altered by the miRNA-identified metabolic genes essential for cell
growth and proliferation that are targeted by the miRNAs.

1 INTRODUCTION

MicroRNA (miRNA) expression has been found to be deregu-
lated in human cancer (Sassen et al., 2008). Some of the ﬁrst
miRNAs identiﬁed to be involved in cancer were miR-15 and
miR-16, which were found downregulated in most lymphocytic
leukemia patients (Calin et al., 2002). Others include oncogenic
miR-l7—92, which promotes c—Myc-induced tumorigenesis in
mice (He et al., 2005), and a tumor suppressor miRNA let-7,
which inhibits expression of the oncogene RAS in lung cancer
cell lines (Johnson et al., 2005). Further, a global decrease in

miRNA levels was observed in human cancers (Gaur et al.,
2007; Lu et al., 2005). Knockout of the miRNA processing en-
zymes, Drosha and Dicer, enhances cancer cell growth in vitro
and their invasiveness in mice (Kumar et al., 2007), conﬁrming
that widespread reduction in miRNA expression could promote
tumorigenesis. Therefore, miRNAs could have intrinsic func-
tions in tumor suppression and be potential therapeutic targets.
Synthetic miRNAs can be introduced into mammalian systems
(Tsuda et al., 2005), as was shown in a pioneering study on
therapeutic miRNA delivery of miR-26s in a HCC mice model
that successfully inhibited tumor cell proliferation and induced
cancer-speciﬁc apoptosis (Kota et al., 2009).

Although miRNAs could be potential alternative targets for
cancer treatment, it has been difﬁcult to identify which miRNAs
to target for a particular type of cancer, as the underlying mech-
anisms of how miRNAs are involved in cancer are largely un-
known. Experimental evidences of how miRNAs regulate their
targets in cancer cells have been limited. The expression of indi-
vidual targets, such as RAS (Johnson et al., 2005) and EZFI
(O’Donnell et al., 2005), has been shown to be regulated by
miRNAs and thereby used to explain the association of
miRNAs with cancer. However, each miRNA could regulate
many target genes, and the same miRNA could have oncogenic
or anti-tumorgenic activity depending on the context or cell type
in which the targets are expressed. Current computational studies
focus primarily on analyzing miRNA expression profiles to iden-
tify miRNAs that are differentially expressed or signatures that
can separate a particular cancer type from normal samples (Kuo
et al., 2012; Liang, 2008; Oulas et al., 2011). More advanced data
mining approaches integrate miRNA, gene expression data and
putative miRNAigene interactions to identify regulatory mod-
ules in which the miRNA expression is found to be negatively
correlated with putative targets in the cancer samples 0(in et al.,
2009; Xionghui Zhou et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011).
Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether the altered miRNA ex-
pressions are the cause or consequence of the carcinogenesis
processes, and which miRNAs could be good targets for treat-
ment. Furthermore, as an miRNA could simultaneously target
many genes, it has been difﬁcult with current approaches to sys-
tematically predict the effect on perturbation of an miRNA.

In this study, we propose an alternative approach to tackle this
problem and integrate putative miRNAitarget-gene interactions,
metabolic modeling and context-specific gene expression data.
Our analysis focuses on the human metabolic system, as abnor-
mal metabolic functions are known to be involved in supporting
tumor growth and proliferation (Vander Heiden et al., 2012).

For example, most cancer cells have higher glycolytic rates,
which is called ‘Warburg effect’ (DeBerardinis et al., 2008;
Vander Heiden et al., 2009). A recent study on breast cancer
further uncovered alterations in glucose metabolism mediated
by the phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase enzyme (Locasale
et al., 2011), whose expression was found to be associated with
poor prognosis (Pollari et al., 2011). Because metabolism plays
an essential role in cell growth and proliferation, genes regulating
metabolism have been used as drug targets in the treatment of
cancer (Galmarini et al., 2008; Serkova et al., 2007).

We hypothesize that miRNAs could be implicated in the meta-
bolic regulation of cancer, and study the targets of miRNAs in
the context of the human metabolic network for which detailed
mechanistic information is available for systems modeling. Our
approach takes advantage of current knowledge of the human
metabolic network to reconstruct a context-speciﬁc metabolic
system for human liver cancer (HCC). The model is used to
predict miRNAs whose overexpression or delivery could inhibit
cancer cell growth by downregulating its target metabolic genes.
By explicitly modeling the cancer phenotype as a speciﬁc meta-
bolic state, we are able to predict not only the miRNAs
‘involved’ or ‘altered’ in cancer but also the potential miRNA
targets that could change the cancer metabolic phenotype if per-
turbed. These targets could be candidates in the treatment of the
disease. This is in contrast to previous studies of miRNA in
cancer where the ‘cancer phenotype’ is used as a label/annotation
of samples against another label of ‘normal’ (Kuo et al., 2012;
Liang, 2008; Oulas et al., 2011). Our approach provides a com-
putational platform to integrate knowledge from different
sources, to study in silico the global effect of miRNA perturb-
ations on the metabolic network and to generate hypotheses that
could provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the regu-
lation of miRNAs on cancer metabolism.

2 METHODS

2.1 Basic assumptions in network reconstruction

Our network reconstruction is based on two assumptions (see
Supplementary Methods for the comparisons with previous approaches):

(1) Information on the context-dependent gene expression, e. g. micro-
array data, tissue-speciﬁc gene database, studies of gene expression
in the literature, can provide the relative gene expression state
change between phenotypes, rather than the ‘expression level/
state’ of a gene. A single ‘expression value’ cannot indicate a
gene’s expression level (or its ON/OFF state) without a compari-
son with different phenotypes. This is because for different genes,
the amount of expression that is required to turn them ON should
be different. For example, signaling molecules could have large
impact when they are expressed at low levels, whereas housekeep-
ing genes would require a constitutiver higher amount of expres-
sion to support cell survival (Paolella, 1997), so the expression level
of these two types of genes (i.e. signaling molecules: LOW, house-
keeping: HIGH) within the samples for a given phenotype would
not correlate with their ON/OFF states that is defined by a single
threshold or expression level. Therefore, we assume only those
genes whose expression levels are signiﬁcantly changed (differen-
tially up- or downregulated) will have an impact on the metabolic
functions.

(2) The state change of the genes/enzymes as indicated by the context
information determines the state change of the reactions by mod-
ulating the maximum reaction rate. This is different from previous
approaches that associate gene expression with reaction states by
either removing a reaction when the corresponding gene expression
is low (Becker and Palsson, 2008) or correlating the ﬂux through
the reaction with gene expression level (Shlomi et al., 2008). Our
assumption is based on the MichaelisiMenten enzyme kinetics
equation in which the maximum reaction rate (i.e. the maximum
capacity of a ﬂux through a reaction tunnel) is positively correlated
or proportional to the concentration/activity of the gene/enzyme
that catalyzes the reaction, assuming that the environmental fac-
tors (e.g. temperature, medium) are constant, the system is at
thermodynamic equilibrium and all measurements are assumed
to be at pseudo-steady state:

Vmax (X Kcat 

Where Km, is a reaction constant and [E] is the concentration of
the enzyme.

2.2 Algorithm for the reconstruction of context-dependent
metabolic network

Step 1. Compute the states of the genes under the condition of interest:
the context information is used to determine the change of gene expres-
sion between the reference condition and the condition of interest. For
example, based on microarray data, the state of a gene changes only when
it is differentially expressed, and the amount of changes 8(Sg) can be
computed based on the ‘log fold-change’ [‘Enew/Erer’ is modeled with
210g(expression level new)7log(expression level reﬁ] Obtained from microarray ana_
lysis. Qualitative information from the literature or tissue-speciﬁc dataset
directly determines the state of a gene under a condition of interest, but
the amount of state change is computed by subtracting the reference state
from the state under the condition of interest, to determine the state of the
reactions in the next step. In these cases, the state of the genes is repre-
sented by discrete variables Sg = {—1,0, 1} (i.e. low, median, high), and
the state changes (‘Enew/Erer’ is modeled with 2(5'3'2 or E”e”’)’(s'm or Ereﬁ)
depend on the context information. Starting from the generic human
metabolic network, the reference condition is deﬁned by having all the
genes initially in state 1, and the initial bounds are computed with ﬂux
variability analysis (FVA) (Mahadevan and Schilling, 2003; Shlomi et al.,
2011).

Step 2. Compute the states of reactions: based on the gene-protein-
reaction information in the network, genes that are components of
an enzyme complex have the ‘AND’ relationship, thus the change of
the activity of these complexes are deﬁned by 8(SL.) =
min{8(Sg1), 8(Sg2), . . . ,8(Sg,-)} in which 8(ng) are the state change of
gene component j in complex c. Complexes/genes that are different iso-
zymes for the same reaction have an ‘OR’ relationship, thus the amount
of state change on a reaction is then deﬁned by the state changes of the
isozymes: 8(S,) = max{8(SL.1),8(Sg2), ...}. Lastly, the upper bound of a
reaction is changed: Vnew = 0M >l< 25(5'), as the state changes are deﬁned
as the ‘log fold change’. The optimization function to determine the ﬂux
(see Section 2.3) for each reaction in the reconstructed network is as
follows:

maxZ 2 CT V,
V
St SV=0,xj 5 V,- 5y,-
In which x, and y, are initiated with FVA when we begin with the
generic human metabolic network, and the upper bound yj = new is
determined by context-dependent gene expression level. FVA analysis

on the generic human model provides the initial bounds/maximum
ﬂuxes of reactions, constrained by the uptake of glucose (whereas the

uptake of oxygen, calcium, sodium, potassium and other irons and phos-
phate is not constrained).

The algorithm is implemented in MATLAB and can be used as an
add-on component to the COBRA toolbox version 2.0 (Becker et al.,
2007; Schellenberger et al., 2011) for network reconstruction.

2.3 Simulation based on a metabolic network model

We apply constraint-based modeling [e.g. ﬂux balance analysis, FBA
(Stephanopoulos et al., 1998)] to simulate the state of the system without
detailed kinetic data, assuming that the ﬂux distributions based on the
stoichiometric mass balance are at steady state or pseudo-steady state. A
reaction network is represented by the stoichiometric matrix: S [with m
compounds (rows) and n reactions (columns)], the ﬂow vector v (n by 1
vector) for the reactions and the concentration vector: X (m by 1 vector)
for the compounds/metabolites. Thus we have dX/dt = S v.

Assuming pseudo-steady state, the time derivative is zero, therefore
Sv = 0. Imposing mass balance and capacity constraints deﬁnes the
space of feasible steady state ﬂux distributions of the network, and we
further apply an objective function Z (for biomass production), which is a
linear function of ﬂuxes:

Z=cTV

in which c is a column vector to assign weights to each reaction, CT is
the transpose of the vector c and V is the ﬂux vector through all
the reactions. The value of c for cancer cells is determined in the
literature (Shlomi et al., 2011). Optimization (maximization) of the ob-
jective function Z identiﬁes a solution of V.. An FVA can further explore
the solution space to exam the maximum/minimum ﬂuxes for each reac-
tion with respect to the objective function. The constrained linear opti-
mization problem for FBA and FVA can be solved by linear
programming (Orth et al., 2010; Toya et al., 2011). We use the
COBRA toolbox version 2.0 for the ﬂux analysis (Becker et al., 2007;
Schellenberger et al., 2011), and GUROBI (http://www.gurobi.com/) for
the linear optimization.

2.4 Datasets and the working pipeline

2.4.1 Metabolic network and the reconstruction The generic
human metabolic network is obtained from Duarte et al. (2007). Liver-
speciﬁc gene expression is extracted from a curated dataset in the litera-
ture (Shlomi et al., 2008), which provides the metabolic genes that are
speciﬁc (differentially up- or downregulated) in human liver. The function
for biomass production was obtained from Shlomi et al. (2011), which is
based on experimentally measured compositions of DNA, RNA, amino
acids and lipids in cancer cells (grown in Roswell Park Memorial Institute
(RPMI)-1640 medium) (Shlomi et al., 2011). Based on the information of
gene expression and the biomass function, we reconstructed a liver-spe-
ciﬁc metabolic network from the generic human metabolic network. The
rationale for optimizing biomass production is because we are focused on
the potential of miRNAs on affecting tumor growth, and we assume that
the miRNAs affect the maximal rate of cancer cell growth that can be
achieved. The doubling time estimated by the unperturbed and perturbed
models range from 10 to 30 h, which we think is reasonable based on our
experiences in culturing liver cancer cells (e.g. HepG2).

2.4.2 Incorporation of miRNA regulation The metabolic gene tar-
gets of each miRNA are obtained from TargetScan, which is based on
sequence complementarity and conservation of the target sites within
vertebrates (Friedman et al., 2009). We are aware that there are many
miRNA target databases that could provide different sets of miRNA
targets. Given limitations in experimental approaches to systematically
verify miRNAitarget relationships, a fair comparison between
these target databases is difﬁcult. TargetScan has been shown to have
higher sensitivity and speciﬁcity compared with other approaches

(Zhang and Verbeek, 2010). We used only the results of the 153 conserved
miRNA family and only the targets with conserved binding sites (across
mammalians). Based on the gene targets of miRNAs in the human meta-
bolic system, we simulated the liver-speciﬁc metabolic network by opti-
mizing the biomass production (which assumes the primary objective of
cancer cells is to grow and proliferate) to predict whether an miRNA
could effectively inhibit cancer growth.

2.4.3 Test the accuracy of prediction To assess the accuracy of the
prediction, i.e. whether the predicted effect of an miRNA on biomass
production correlates with its ability to inhibit/promote cancer growth,
requires a test set. There is no comprehensive list available of miRNAs
that have been investigated experimentally for a cancer type. Therefore,
we manually searched in the published literature for evidence for each of
the 153 miRNA families. Through an exhaustive search we found 50
related papers in peer-reviewed journals, which involve experimental stu-
dies on HCC or related human liver cell lines with regards to 41 of the 153
miRNA families. We read the papers and curated a test set that includes
these 41 miRNAs that have been experimentally studied in liver cancer.
The in vivo or in vitro evidences show 23 of these 41 miRNAs inhibit liver
cancer growth/metastasis if overexpressed, whereas 18 have no effect or
have the opposite (i.e. enhancing) effect (Supplementary Table Sl). We
established the accuracy of our approach by comparing the prediction
results with the test set.

We compared our approach with a previous method GIMME (gene
inactivity moderated by metabolism and expression), which also recon-
structs tissue-speciﬁc networks and simulates by optimizing an objective
function (Becker and Palsson, 2008; Chang et al., 2010). GIMME takes in
gene expression data and removes all the reactions associated with genes
that are expressed lowly. Because removing reactions from the network
may disconnect the ﬂuxes, GIMME then adds back some reactions to
connect the network (so that the objective function is fulﬁlled). There
could be many ways to add reactions back into the system to make the
ﬂuxes connected (e. g. one valid way is to add back all reactions that were
removed, which actually retain the original human recon 1, the non-spe-
cific model), and GIMME adds the least possible amount of reactions to
fulﬁll the objective function. In our reconstruction approach, we do not
remove reactions; instead, the ﬂux bounds of the reactions are changed by
the differentially expressed genes. A new network ﬂux scenario can be
determined by the updated reaction bounds, rather than by removing or
adding back reactions as in GIMME. The code of GIMME was down-
loaded from Becker et al. (2007) and Schellenberger et al. (2011), and our
online tutorials describe how we applied GIMME.

2.4.4 Exploring mechanisms of how miRNAs aﬁ’ect cancer
metabolism The data to support our ‘essential metabolic genes’ are
obtained from COLT-Cancer, a genome-wide pooled small hairpin RNA
(shRNA) screen dataset (Koh et al., 2011). Essential is deﬁned by a sig-
niﬁcant (P< 0.05) reduction in the survival and proliferation of the cells
on their knockdown by shRNA in more than one cancer cell lines. The
data of the liver cancer gene signatures are from the Liverome database
(Lee et al., 2011), which collects the genes that have been shown to be
differentially expressed in liver cancer tissues or in highly invasive liver
cancer cell lines. We further collected miRNA expression data for HCC
from Li et al. (2008), compared with our curated literature evidences, to
show that the expression change at the miRNA level may not necessarily
indicate whether it is a good target.

See Supplementary Methods for a comparison of approaches in the
reconstruction of a context-speciﬁc metabolic network. The network re-
construction and miRNA prediction pipeline is available, and a step-by-
step protocol is provided, see Supplementary Protocol ﬁle.

3 RESULTS

In this study, we reconstruct a human context-dependent meta-
bolic network to associate gene expression changes with con-
straints on the reactions. Based on a reference metabolic
network [e.g. the generic human metabolic network (Duarte
et al., 2007)] and the context information obtained from gene
expression data of a particular phenotype of interest, our ap-
proach estimates the activity change of each reaction and adjusts
the upper bounds (i.e. the maximum capacity) of the reaction, to
provide a new metabolic network model that is speciﬁc to the
condition. The process is shown in Figure 1, and the algorithm is
described in Section 2.

Information on the human liver-speciﬁc gene expression is
obtained from a curated dataset in the literature (Shlomi et al.,
2008). Our approach is applied to reconstruct a liver cancer-
speciﬁc metabolic model from the human generic metabolic net-
work by setting the maximum capacity of the reactions based on
context information obtained from gene expression data of
cancer samples. The liver-speciﬁc metabolic network is used to
predict the growth and proliferation rate of cancer cells with
FBA (Section 2). Because cancer cells modulate metabolic func-
tions to help support their rapid growth and proliferation, bio-
mass production (Shlomi et al., 2011) was used as the objective
function to reﬂect the growth and proliferation rate of the cancer
cells. The rate of biomass production is based on experimentally
measured compositions of DNA, RNA, amino acids and lipids
in cancer cells (Shlomi et al., 2011) and reﬂects the maximum rate
of cell growth and proliferation that can be achieved.

To estimate the robustness of the network reconstruction
against potential noise from gene expression data, we applied
FVA (Delgado and Liao, 1997; Park et al., 2009) on the

Fig. 1. Reconstruct context-speciﬁc metabolic network. The context in-
formation provides the state change of the gene expression between two
phenotypes. The state change of each reaction is then determined by the
state change of the genes that regulate the reaction. In this example, a
reaction can be catalyzed (activated) by any of the three isozymes. The
ﬁrst isozyme is a complex involving two genes: gene 1-1 and gene 1-2. The
other two isozymes are encoded by gene 2 and gene 3. Based on a gene
expression proﬁle where gene 1-1 and gene 2 are upregulated, whereas
gene 1-2 and gene 3 are downregulated, although the isozyme complex 1
is not activated, as it relies on the activation of both gene 1-1 and gene
1-2, the reaction is activated, as the isozyme encoded by gene 2 is acti-
vated. The activities of the reactions then determine the change of ﬂuxes
in the metabolic network. Thus the gene expression phenotype is asso-
ciated with a metabolic state

reconstructed liver model. FVA performs a sensitivity analysis
of the ﬂuxes with respect to changes in reaction bounds that are
determined by the gene expression data. The results of FVA
show that a 25% reduction of the upper bound in all the reac-
tions that carry ﬂuxes would only reduce the output of the model
by no more than 10% (i.e. retain 90% of the biomass produc-
tion). On average, the bounds need to be changed 83% for any
reaction that carry ﬂuxes to be able to change biomass produc-
tion by 10%. Nevertheless in our reconstruction, for a reaction
to have a 25% reduction in the bounds requires all the genes in a
particular enzyme complex that catalyze the reaction to have
>2-fold downregulation in expression. Therefore, the FVA re-
sults suggest a robust system that is insensitive to potential noise
in the microarray data.

3.1 Prediction of the metabolic state of liver cancer
cells on perturbation of miRNA levels that regulate
metabolic genes

Collating the metabolic gene targets of each miRNA obtained
from TargetScan, which is based on sequence complementarity
and conservation of the target sites within vertebrates (Friedman
et al., 2009), results in 153 conserved miRNA family with con-
served binding sites (across mammalians). The model assumes
the gene targets are inhibited (50% knockdown) on overexpres-
sion of their miRNA regulator, as the miRNA binds to these
target mRNAs by base pairing and forms RNA-induced silen-
cing complex that then inhibits protein translation and/or
enhances degradation of the mRNAs (Bartel, 2004). A condi-
tion-speciﬁc metabolic system is constructed by overexpressing
each miRNA with their targets downregulated (i.e. 50% decrease
in gene expression) and simulated to obtain the maximum
achievable biomass production rate F on the perturbation of
the miRNA. This is compared with the rate F0 in the ‘wild-
type’ liver cancer metabolic network without upregulation of
the miRNAs. A score F0 — F is computed for each miRNA to
indicate their ability to reduce cancer growth. The miRNAs are
ranked by this score. The procedure is shown in Figure 2.

(overexpressed thus the putative targets are partially knocked down) to
reconstruct a metabolic network on perturbation. FBA is applied on the
liver-speciﬁc network, and the perturbed network is used to estimate
whether the perturbation reduces cell growth/proliferation based on the
objective function for cancer cells (i.e. biomass production)

Prediction of therapeutic microRNA

 

To estimate the robustness of the prediction against potential
errors (e.g. false positives) in the miRNA target prediction, we
perturb the system by randomly removing a small fraction of the
targets predicted for each miRNA. Our simulations show that
with 10% of the predicted targets randomly removed for each
miRNA, the prediction results are stable, i.e. the predicted
changes in biomass production correlate to the unperturbed
model with an average Pearson correlation coefﬁcient of 0.90
(standard deviation 0.05) in 100 simulations. Even with as
many as 20% or one-ﬁfth of the predicted targets randomly
changed (removed) for each miRNA, the simulation results
remain correlated with the unperturbed model with an average
Pearson correlation coefﬁcient of 0.80 (standard deviation 0.09)
in 100 random simulations. We further examine to what extent
our assumption of miRNA-induced knockdown rate (originally
set as 50% or 2-fold downregulation) affects the prediction. We
simulate the model with 25% (4-fold) and 12.5% (8-fold) knock-
down. These perturbed models predict biomass production
changes that still correlated well with the original model. The
Pearson correlation coefﬁcients to the original model (with the
parameter set to 50%) are 0.91 and 0.86 (P20) in the 25 and
12.5% knockdown, respectively.

To assess the accuracy of the prediction, we search in the lit-
erature for information on the 153 miRNA families and collate a
test set including 41 miRNAs that have been experimentally
studied in liver cancer. The in vivo or in vitro evidences show
23 of these 41 miRNAs inhibit liver cancer growth/metastasis
if overexpressed, whereas 18 have no effect or have the opposite
(i.e. enhancing) effect (Supplementary Table S1). Based on our
scoring and ranking of the miRNAs, a Receiver-Operating
Characteristic curve is plotted for the predictions of these 41
miRNAs in the test set (the black line with circular markers in
Fig. 3), which shows a prediction accuracy (area under curve)
>82% [the best cutoff based on the test set is at 0.2 in the unit of
milligram per gram dry weight per hour (mg/gDW/h)]. In the test
set, 5 of the top 5 (100%, hypergeometric test P<0.05) or 12 of
the top 15 (80%, hypergeometric test P< 0.02) with the highest
scores predicted to inhibit HCC are supported experimentally by
the literature to be tumor suppressors in HCC (see
Supplementary Table S1). Comparison with a current approach

network reconstruction that was previously applied to human
metabolism (the green line with square markers in Fig. 3) gave
a prediction accuracy of 64%, only slightly better than random
(23/41 B 56%) and lower than the predictions based on our
approach. For example, with the same cutoff with a false-positive
rate of 0.33, our approach achieves 0.91 precision (true-positive
rate), a higher prediction accuracy than GIMME (0.57).

We apply the approach to the entire 153 miRNA families
(which includes the 41 miRNAs in the test set and the other
112 miRNAs that have no information on their impact on
liver cancer). Four of the top 10 miRNAs with the highest
scores are in the test set and all of them are supported experi-
mentally by the literature to be tumor suppressors in HCC (see
Supplementary Table S2). We predict the other 6 miRNAs of the
top 10 could be novel candidates of tumor suppressors of HCC
for further experimental studies. Although there is no experimen-
tal evidence currently for these six miRNAs in peer-reviewed
journals, we found in newly published conference abstracts
that 3 of the 6 miRNAs have been suggested to be tumor sup-
pressors, among which miR- 149 and miR-491 have been tested in
liver cancer cell lines (see Supplementary Table S2).

Next, we further explored the reconstructed metabolic net-
work for liver cancer to identify potential mechanisms by
which the miRNAs inhibit cancer growth.

3.2 Metabolic functions modulated by miRNAs to
inhibit cancer growth

To study the metabolic functions that the miRNAs modulate to
inhibit cancer growth, we compared the averaged ﬂux changes
induced by the top 50 miRNAs (predicted to inhibit cancer
growth) with the bottom 50 (predicted not to inhibit cancer
growth) ranked based on their scores, to identify the subsystems
with the greatest change. We found that the largest ﬂux changes
occurred for the production of nucleotides and amino acids, the
glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways, the tricarboxylic acid cycle
and pyruvate metabolism, as well as transport processes across
the cellular, mitochondrial and peroxisomal membranes. These
are essential metabolic functions that support the biosynthetic
processes and energy requirements of the cells. Tumor-speciﬁc
metabolic machinery regulates these processes to facilitate cell
growth and proliferation (Vander Heiden et al., 2009), and our
model indicates that these miRNAs could alter the metabolic
processes that support cancer growth.

One of the most well-known cancer biochemical phenotype is
the Warburg eﬂect (WARBURG, 1956a, b). The Warburg effect
is known as a metabolic adaptive response in cancer cells to
satisfy the high demand of the molecular building blocks of the
cell, i.e. nucleotides, fatty acids, lipids and amino acids, and the
energy requirements through ATP, to facilitate proliferation
(Shlomi et al., 2011; Vander Heiden et al., 2009). Cancer cells
metabolize glucose at high rates and shift the ﬂux downstream of
glucose from the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle to the
more rapid anerobic glycolysis, thereby producing vast amounts
of lactate that is secreted from the cancer cells (V ander Heiden
et al., 2009). Because an indicator of the Warburg effect is ex-
cessive lactate production, we analyzed the ﬂux change (from the
FBA results) in response to miRNA perturbations on the reac-
tion catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which converts

decreased signiﬁcantly (on average by 50%) on overexpressing
the miRNAs that scored higher (top 50), whereas the bottom 50
miRNA did not impact this ﬂux (P< 0.001 t—test). We perform
FVA analysis on the models and the upper bounds of the LDH
reaction for the top 50 miRNAs also show on average a >40%
decrease. These results suggest that the top miRNAs could
impact liver cancer growth by mitigating the Warburg effect to
alter the cancer metabolic phenotype.

3.3 miRNA target metabolic enzymes that are essential
for cancer growth

Each miRNA has multiple targets, but the correlation between
the number of targets in metabolism and their ability to inhibit
cancer growth is low (Pearson correlation coefﬁcient=0.26).
Permutation tests were performed on the top 10 predicted
miRNAs, by knocking down the same number of random
genes as the number of miRNA targets, for 1000 times. We
found that the number of target genes of the miRNAs is not
correlated with their ability to inhibit cancer growth. In contrast,
the top 10 miRNAs decrease the proliferation signiﬁcantly
(P<0.05). Thus, we hypothesize that there are important en-
zymes, on targeting, wherein the cell growth and proliferation
are reduced. We applied our reconstruction and simulation ap-
proach to estimate the change in biomass production on knock-
down of each metabolic gene individually. This identified the
essential genes (or genes that supports cancer growth) that
could reduce cell growth on knockdown of the metabolic gene
(i.e. reduce biomass production). In practice these are numerical
computations, there will be values having small ﬂuctuation
around 0. Thus the threshold is set at 0.01 mg/gDW/h to
obtain robust results. Essential is deﬁned by a signiﬁcant reduc-
tion in the survival and proliferation of the cells on their knock-
down by shRNA (where CULT database provides a
P—Value<0.05 on their scores of gene activity ranking proﬁles
on shRNA knockdown). Of the 48 genes (among >1900 meta-
bolic genes) that are predicted to be essential for the growth and
proliferation of liver cancer cells (i.e. reduces biomass production

on knockdown), 24 can be targeted by miRNAs (Supplementary
Table S3). We search in a genome-wide pooled shRNA screen
dataset (Koh et al., 2011) containing breast cancer, pancreatic
and ovarian cancer cell lines and found that many of the genes in
the list, including phosphorylase, glycogen; brain (PYGB), glucan
(I,4—alpha—), branching enzyme 1 (GBEI), Stearoyl—CoA desatur-
ase-I (SCD), enolase, pyruvate kinase and solute carrier family
proteins have been identified as essential genes in >2 cancer cell
lines. Because there are no liver cell lines in these studies, we
further analyzed a collection of liver cancer gene signatures in
the Liverome database (Lee et al., 2011) to determine if these
genes are differentially expressed in liver cancer tissues or in
highly invasive liver cancer cell lines. We found a majority of
these genes (71%, or 17 of 24) have been identiﬁed as gene sig-
natures for liver cancer or for invasiveness/metastasis in liver
cancer based on their gene expression analysis (Supplementary
Table S3, the columns: signature of cancer/normal and signature
of invasiveness).

Although the evidence found suggests that these genes could
be important for liver cancer, they have not been fully explored.
According to text mining studies of the abstracts in the pubmed
literature (Lee et al., 2011), there is only one enzyme (enolase)
that has been experimentally studied and associated with liver
cancer. However, some of the others have been studied in other
types of cancers to demonstrate their functional role in tumor
growth. The glycolytic pathway is directly responsive to the
Warburg effect in cancer, thus the key glycolytic enzymes, eno-
lases and pyruvate kinases, both in the list, have been shown to
promote cancer invasion and proliferation (Capello et al., 2011;
Christoﬂ< et al., 2008; Tu et al., 2010). Knockdown of pyruvate
kinase PKM2 reverses the Warburg effect and suppresses
tumorigenesis in mice model (Christoﬂ< et al., 2008). The high
expression of enolase correlates with poor prognosis in breast
cancer and a decrease in its expression in tamoxifen-resistant
breast cancer cells significantly augments the effectiveness of
tamoxifen treatment (Tu et al., 2010). The pentose phosphate
pathway uses glucose to generate ribose rings that are essential
for the synthesis of DNA and RNA. Both of these key enzymes
that catalyze the production of ribose-5-phosphate are on the list
of essential genes: ribulose—5—phosphate-3—epimerase (RPE) and
ribose 5—phosphate isomerase A (RPIA). Our simulation predicts
that downregulation of either of these two metabolic genes re-
duces DNA/RNA synthesis, which is consistent with a recent
study in pancreatic cancer Wing et al., 2012) that showed knock-
down of either of the two enzymes (or both) reduced glucose ﬂux
into nucleotide production and suppressed tumor growth. Fatty
acid metabolism and lipid synthesis are also important in cell
proliferation as they are primary components of cellular mem-
brane. SCD activity is involved in the synthesis of unsaturated
fatty acids and could promote the oncogenic process and was
suggested as a therapeutic target for prostate cancer (Fritz et al.,
2010; Hess et al., 2010; Igal, 2010, 2011). In addition, phospho-
glucomutase 1 (PGMl) (Singh et al., 2011), hydroxyacyl-CoA
dehydrogenase alpha/beta (HADHA/B) family (Zhou et al.,
2012) and the solute carrier family 25 genes (Sotgia et al.,
2012) have been shown to be upregulated in cancer. glycogenin
1 (GYGl) and glycogen synthase 1 (GYSl) are involved in gly-
co genolysis/ glycogenesis and are listed as signatures of metastasis
in the Liverome database. Upregulation of GYSl has been

(Tsavachidou et al., 2010). The expressions of two other genes,
DLD and PYGB, are unclear but are listed as liver cancer signa-
tures in the Liverome database. The phospholipase A2, group IVA
(PLA2G4A), GBEI and galactose—I-phosphate uridylyltransferase
(GALT) genes have not been explored in cancer thus far accord-
ing to the literature and could be potential targets for further
study experimentally. Figure 5 summarizes the metabolic path-
ways and processes that could be affected by these essential en-
zymes identiﬁed to be targeted by miRNAs in the analysis.

We analyzed the miRNAs that target these enzymes that could
be essential for liver cancer and found a strong association be-
tween targeting these enzymes and the ability of the miRNAs to
inhibit liver cancer growth. For example, 90% of the miRNAs
ranked in the top 50 based on their score target at least one of
these essential enzymes, whereas none of the miRNAs at the
bottom 50 target these enzymes (P<0.01 in Fisher exact test).
These observations suggest that miRNAs could modulate meta-
bolic function by targeting metabolic enzymes that are essential
for cell growth and proliferation. Supplementary Table S4 lists
the ﬁve miRNAs in the test set that have the highest score and
their essential metabolic gene targets predicted by the analysis, as
well as previous studies showing their signaling targets and in-
volvement in liver cancer. Overall the model predictions and
analysis suggest that miRNAs could directly modulate cancer
metabolism, in addition to signaling pathways.

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 Predicting targets for the treatment of cancer

Many computational approaches rely on statistics and data
mining/machine learning techniques to predict cancer-related
genes (Kuo et al., 2012; Liang, 2008; Oulas et al., 2011). The
prediction is usually based on whether there are signiﬁcant dif-
ferences in the gene expression of the cancer as compared with
normal samples. These approaches might identify genes that
could distinguish/separate cancer and normal phenotype, but
may not necessarily be the ‘targets’ that change the phenotype

and thus not ideal for treatment of cancer. The expression
change in an miRNA level may not necessarily indicate whether
it is a good target. To show this, we collected miRNA expression
data on HCC from Li et al. (2008) and provide this information
of the miRNAs in our study in the Supplementary Table S5.
Given the propensity to identify targets by searching for differ-
entially expressed genes, we found that, in our test set, 43% (10
of 23) of the miRNAs whose overexpression/delivery are able to
inhibit the growth, invasion or metastasis of HCC are not dif-
ferentially expressed [e.g. including miR-124, which was identi-
ﬁed by researchers at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute who are
planning to begin a clinical trial (Hatziapostolou et al.,
2011, 4)], whereas some of them are even highly expressed in
HCC. This suggests that the gene targets for the treatment of
cancer may not necessary be identified by mining/learning from
gene expression changes alone. This is because in these mining/
learning methods the cancer phenotype is only a ‘label’ or ‘an-
notation’ on the samples that are unable to capture the informa-
tion contained in a ‘cancer phenotype’ (i.e. other than the speciﬁc
gene expression pattern, the speciﬁc cellular behavior or the spe-
ciﬁc metabolic states). Our approach differs from previous
approaches to predict miRNAs involved in cancer by predicting
miRNA targets whose overexpression or delivery could inhibit
HCC through explicitly modeling the cancer phenotype as a spe-
ciﬁc metabolic state. We compare our prediction against a test
set and show that we could fairly accurately identify the miRNA
targets. We believe that only when one is able to clearly model a
phenotype can one predict the targets to modulate the
phenotype.

4.2 Future studies on the role of miRNAs in cancer
metabolism

Current studies on the role of miRNAs in liver cancer [reviewed
in (Huang and He, 2011)] have been focused on targets in sig-
naling processes, involving the apoptosis pathway (e.g. Bcl-w,
Ras), cell cycle progression and migration/invasion signaling
(e.g. CDK, cyclins, PI3K signaling PTEN, c—Met, FOS). There
are a few studies that explore the regulation of cancer metabolic
functions by miRNAs [see review (Singh et al., 2011)], but cur-
rently they focus only on glycolysis, in which essential enzymes
PGMl and ENOl are shown to be regulated by miRNA-29a
and miR-17-92. Nevertheless, in these studies it is unclear
whether the miRNAs directly target these enzymes.
Alternatively, we provide a modeling approach that focuses on
direct metabolic targets of miRNAs and enables predictions
based on the metabolic system. The results of this modeling ap-
proach suggest that miRNAs could regulate cancer growth by
directly modulating metabolic functions.

Given that miRNAs could target metabolic functions to regu-
late cancer growth, one could inspect the list of metabolic en-
zymes reported in the literature (resulting either from
experimental studies of network-based theoretical work) that
are capable of preventing or delaying cancer growth and then
predict the appropriate miRNAs that target at least one of these
enzymes. In contrast to this simple method, we applied a system-
atic study to model the metabolic systems that are perturbed by
miRNAs. Thus our model has the advantage of not only pre-
dicting and prioritizing miRNAs for further experimental study

but also could provide a systematic view of the combinatorial
effect of multiple targets of an miRNA on human metabolism,
which could facilitate exploration of the mechanisms of how
miRNAs regulate metabolic functions. The proposed approach
can be easily applied to other cancer types to predict specific
miRNAs for the cancer type.

There are many other approaches developed to constrain re-
action ﬂuxes in metabolic models based on gene expression to
build context-speciﬁc models (Wu and Chan, 2012), including
GIMME (Becker and Palsson, 2008; Chang et al., 2010),
iMAT (Shlomi et al., 2008), Model Building Algorithm (Folger
et al., 2011; Gille et al., 2010; Jerby et al., 2010), E-ﬂux (Colijn
et al., 2009), tFBA (Van Berlo et al. 2011), MADE (Jensen and
Papin, 2011) and mCADRE (Wang et al., 2012). Our reconstruc-
tion is based on signiﬁcant changes of gene expression rather
than direct association of ON/OFF in gene expression with pres-
ence/absence of ﬂuxes, which is similar to tFBA and MADE.
Nevertheless, our approach differs from theirs in the sense that
we apply rules to constrain the ﬂuxes and optimize cell growth
like GIMME, rather than optimizing consistencies between ex-
pression and ﬂuxes. Our unique contribution is in the incorpor-
ation of miRNA regulation to the system. Although there has
not been an unbiased comparison between different reconstruc-
tion approaches, it could be valuable to adopt or incorporate
these alternative approaches, and to take the advantage of the
accumulation of metabolomic data (Chan et al. 2003; Caspi et al.
2008; Srivastava and Chan, 2008; Patti et al. 2012) in future work
to improve our reconstruction speciﬁc for miRNA predictions.

The limitation of the study is that there could be indirect ef-
fects potentially responsive to signaling and transcriptional regu-
lations that are mediated by the miRNAs. The possible
interactions between miRNA, signaling processes, transcription
factors and the expression of metabolic genes complicated the
study in exploring the functional roles of miRNAs in cancer
(Huang and He, 2011). We have thus considered only the
direct targets of miRNAs in the metabolic system, but there
could be indirect targets whose expression is altered by transcrip-
tion factors that are regulated by miRNAs. For example, miR-26
is known to inhibit HCC by directly targeting the signaling pro-
cess (mediated by cyclin D and cyclin E) that regulates cell cycle,
thereby affecting cancer metabolism (Kota et al., 2009). Only
accounting for its direct targets among the metabolic genes
cannot capture such information in the signaling process, there-
fore one should further incorporate the transcriptional regula-
tory network to describe regulation at this level. Paired miRNA
and gene expression profiles on perturbation of the miRNAs, if
available, could be integrated to build a more comprehensive
model of target genes’ expressions. This model would predict
the response of the gene targets to overexpression of a particular
miRNA, instead of assuming that all the predicted gene targets
are inhibited on overexpression or therapeutic delivery of their
miRNA regulators. It was recently found that some miRNAs
might also increase gene expression (Place et al., 2008), but cur-
rently few of these have been observed in human. As more in-
formation is known for this type of regulation, they could be
further included in the model to provide a more accurate predic-
tion of the miRNA targets. Future studies with miRNAs will aim
to incorporate more complex gene networks in regulating the
expression of metabolic genes and account for potential

interactions between miRNA, signaling, transcription and meta-
bolic systems to achieve a systematic understanding of cancer
metabolism.

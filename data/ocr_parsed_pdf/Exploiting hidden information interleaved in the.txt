Abstract

Motivation: Dozens of studies in recent years have demonstrated that codon usage encodes
various aspects related to all stages of gene expression regulation. When relevant high—quality
large—scale gene expression data are available, it is possible to statistically infer and model these
signals, enabling analysing and engineering gene expression. However, when these data are not
available, it is impossible to infer and validate such models.

Results: In this current study, we suggest Chimera—an unsupervised computationally efficient ap—
proach for exploiting hidden high—dimensional information related to the way gene expression is
encoded in the open reading frame (ORF), based solely on the genome of the analysed organism.
One version of the approach, named Chimera Average Repetitive Substring (ChimeraARS), esti—
mates the adaptability of an ORF to the intracellular gene expression machinery of a genome
(host), by computing its tendency to include long substrings that appear in its coding sequences;
the second version, named ChimeraMap, engineers the codons of a protein such that it will include
long substrings of codons that appear in the host coding sequences, improving its adaptation to a
new host’s gene expression machinery. We demonstrate the applicability of the new approach for
analysing and engineering heterologous genes and for analysing endogenous genes. Specifically,
focusing on Escherichia coli, we show that it can exploit information that cannot be detected by
conventional approaches (e.g. the CAI—Codon Adaptation Index), which only consider single
codon distributions; for example, we report correlations of up to 0.67 for the ChimeraARS measure
with heterologous gene expression, when the CAI yielded no correlation.

1 Introduction

The inherent redundancy of the genetic code, where 61 codons en-
code only 20 amino acids, is a wider studied phenomenon
(Chamary et (11., 2006; Plotkin and Kudla, 2010; Sauna and Kimchi—

Sarfaty, 2013). In recent years, it has been shown that various gene plex (Kozak, 1986; Zur and Tuller, 2013a,

b),

 

expression regulatory aspects are interleaved in this redundancy.
Specifically, during its lifetime the messenger RNA (mRNA) se-
quence interacts with various intracellular molecules and complexes,
such as the spliceosome (Cartegni et (11., 2002), pre-initiation com-

ribosomes

If the distribution of S and G is similar, S can be better com—
pressed by G. If MS:MG, then the ChimeraARS(G,S) [Equation
(1)] converges to log ()G))/H(Ms), where H(MS) is the entropy of
M5 and it is known that H(M5) is smaller than —EMSlog (MC)
[Equation (2)] for M, #- MC.

Finally, by definition, genes designed according to the
ChimeraMap algorithm should have higher ChimeraARS scores:
ChimeraMap engineers the coding sequence of the target gene such
that it will include long substrings that appear in a reference genome,
while the ChimeraARS measure detects the tendency of a coding se—
quence to include long substrings that appear in a reference genome,
and thus its adaptability to the genome’s gene expression machinery.

2.2 The Chimera algorithms

1. The algorithm of the ﬁrst version, ChimeraARS: The pre—process—
ing step of the algorithm is based on building a sufﬁx tree (or suf—
ﬁx array) (Gusﬁeld, 1997; Manber and Myers, 1993) for the
coding sequences of the host genome. This can be done in O()G)),
where [G] is the length of the proteome/coding sequences of the
host (Farach, 1997; Manber and Myers, 1993). We will discuss
the complexity of a sufﬁx tree implementation, though due to the
genomes” size in practice sometimes a sufﬁx array implementation
is advisable if space considerations are more critical than time.
Then, the length of the longest substring starting at each position
in the target gene that appears in the host genome can be found
in an efficient manner in O(IPI) (Gusfield, 1997) [matching statis—
tics algorithm, pp. 132—134, this is achieved by building the suffix
tree for G maintaining the suffix links (shortcuts between internal
nodes related to substrings and their suffixes), which are then uti—
lized together with the skip/count trick to shorten traversal time].
Thus, the total time complexity of the algorithm is O()GI + )P)).

2. The algorithm of the second version, ChimeraMap: This is a DP
algorithm that builds an optimized representation of a given pro—
tein P, maintaining the encoded protein, to that of a speciﬁed ref—
erence (host) genome G, by minimizing the number of (most
frequent) substrings from the reference genome required to cover
it. This problem naively solved is essentially exponential.
ChimeraMap reduces this to polynomial time based on the obser—
vation that the optimal solution can be greedily extended in each
DP step. Similarly to the ChimeraARS, the pre—processing step of
the algorithm is based on building a sufﬁx tree (Gusﬁeld, 1997)
for the coding sequences of the reference genome in time 0( ) G)).
The premise of the algorithm is that all that is necessary is to con—
sider only the previous step in the DP optimal solution space.
Thus, utilizing DP, at each step i (in which the length i of the sub—
string of P we are looking at grows by 1 from the previous step,
with i being from 1 to )P)), we look at the previous step’s (i — 1)
optimal solution and determine based on it what the optimal solu—
tion for step i is. The manner in which ChimeraMap tries to
elongate the previous optimal solution to length i is as follows.
Each optimal solution is represented by a list of pairs of numbers,
symbolizing the start and end positions of the substrings (blocks)
covering P up to that point (Fig. 2B). ChimeraMap looks at the
last such block ([start end]) and tries to find a match in the suffix
tree of G for P(start:i), and if that fails for P(end+1:i). If we
maintain a pointer to the end of solution i— 1 in the suffix tree,
then we can check in 0(1) if there is a match for P(start:i), by
simply continuing the down traversal on the current edge to the
next character. If a match is found we are done, otherwise a
pointer is kept to the root of the tree and we can begin the search
for P(end + 1:i) in constant time. Thus, we get a total time

complexity of O()G) + )P)). One interesting observation regarding
the properties of the ChimeraMap is that there exists a maximal
length for a ‘covering’ substring from a reference genome. Let
lcsMAX denote the length of the longest substring that is common
to P and G. lcsMAX can be calculated using the common suffix
tree of P that is found in G and all its prefixes. If the sequences G
and P are generated by a Markov process, O(lcsMAX) is expected
to be of the order of O(log)G)) [see Equation (1)]; in the
analysed organism, [G] equals 3 958 573, the log of which is
15.2, while the mean lcsMAX is 15.3 with a standard deviation
(STD) of 38.

2.3 The optimality of the ChimeraMap

Here, we prove that the DP algorithm for the second version of the
Chimera approach, the ChimeraMap, indeed finds an optimal solu—
tion with induction, n : 

The base case: i: 1: The algorithm initiates with the first charac—
ter of P. The first solution is therefore the block [1,1], and it is
trivially optimal.

Inductive step: assume optimality for i=n—1: We assume we

 

have optimal solutions for all the algorithm steps up to n — 1.

Prove optimality for i: n: The algorithm at each step looks back at
the previous solution and elongates it according to the following rule:
look at the last mapped block ([sumf end]) of the solution and try to
find a match in the suffix tree for P(51‘art:i), and if that fails for
P(end + 1:i). If a match is found, merge to the current previous solu—
tion in the appropriate manner. For each solution, we elongate its last
block, thus not increasing the number of substrings covering P, and
since that solution was optimal, so is our solution for i. If we cannot
elongate an existing block, we will open a new one, [end+ 1 1'], thus
increasing the previous optimal solution by one. If an existing block
could have been elongated, this solution is chosen as the optimal for
step i. If not, the optimal solution grows by no more than one. Now
assume that the optimal solution of step i: 11 includes 1 blocks. We as—
sume that the algorithm found all the optimal solutions for i < n and
show that it will find the optimal solution for i : 11.

Since the optimal solution of i : 11 includes 1 blocks, the optimal
solution for i: n — 1 includes either I — 1 or 1 blocks. If it is of length
l — 1, then no extension of the last block exists, and the algorithm
adds a new block to the ith solution. If it is of length 1 blocks, this
means that an extension exists. Let us assume by negation that the
last block of the solution i211 — 1 is of length to and represents the
string or and cannot be extended. Thus, since according to our as—
sumption the optimal solution for the ith step includes 1 blocks, there
must be a block representing the string [3 of length > to that can be
extended. But at is a suffix of I} and therefore can also be extended,
contradicting our negation assumption.

estimation is expected to correlate with the expression levels and/0r
gene expression regulation levels of a gene. In addition, we show
that the ChimeraARS exploits high—dimensional information that is
not included in indexes, such as the CA1, that are based on the distri—
bution of single codons.

Furthermore, we suggest a version of the Chimera approach,
ChimeraMap, that can be used for engineering new genes for their
efficient expression in a new host. The ChimeraMap optimizes the
coding sequence encoding a protein such that it will include as few
as possible substrings of the host genome (i.e. longer substrings). We
show that the output of the ChimeraMap correlates with the
ChimeraARS score; in addition, we show that the ChimeraARS
score predicts the expression levels of heterologous genes in E.coli
well. Thus, the ChimeraMap is expected to be a useful approach for
heterologous coding sequence optimization.

More generally, the analyses reported in this study suggest that
codon bias, if defined accurately, is useful in detecting highly ex—
pressed genes in cases where conventional approaches do not work,
such as heterologous gene expression (Goodman et al., 2013). In
addition, we show that the protein levels of endogenous and heterol—
ogous genes can be defined by their codon and amino acid content
based only on genomic information.

Naturally, our approach can be generalized in various ways. For
example, here for simplicity (and demonstrating the unsupervised
advantage of our approach) the reference set of genes used for the
Chimera approach included the entire genome. We can readily think
of other relevant reference sets such as highly expressed genes, tis—
sue—specific genes, or genes with a certain function or property.
Another variation is related to the objective function of the
ChimeraMap algorithm; there are many relevant objective func—
tions, such as functions that penalize shorter codon blocks non—uni—
formly along the ORF (if we have prior knowledge that certain
regions in the ORF contribute less to its regulation), function(s) that
trade—off frequency versus substring length in a different manner
than the one reported here, or weighted functions according to the
frequency of the substrings. Thus, we can extrapolate many variants
of the approach, and in that manner calibrate it to suit specific prob—
lems. The last example is related to the alphabet used; here, for sim—
plicity, we worked with nucleotides (Supplementary Material);
however, it may make sense to work with codons, codon pairs, or
divide the codons to sub—sets of codons assumed to be ‘identical’.

Moreover, a version of the Chimera approach may also be used
for engineering and estimating the information related to gene ex—
pression encoded in other parts of the gene such as untranslated re—
gions and introns, known to also include signals related to gene
expression regulation (Goodarzi et al., 2012; Wang and Cooper,
2007).

The ChimeraARS algorithm may also be modified to consider
both substrings” lengths and their frequencies. In such a case, the
major challenge is to model the trade—off between length and fre—
quency. We believe that the trade—off is organismal specific and
should be inferred for each organism separately, possibly based on
gene expression (adding additional layers of complexity to such a
measure).

Finally, in this study, we analysed Ecoli because this is the only
organism with large—scale measurements of both heterologous and
endogenous gene expression data. However, we believe that the re—
sults reported here will be even more significant for eukaryotes, and
specifically multi—cellular organisms such as plants; there are differ—
ent stages of gene expression, including many types of interactions
with the mRNA molecules that occur only in these groups of organ—
isms; for example, splicing, interaction with the nuclear pores, and

regulation by miRNA (Fig. 1), occur only in eukaryotes; all these ex—
amples include interactions between the intracellular machinery and
the mRNA molecule, and are at least partially encoded in the ORF
via the high—dimensional distribution of codons. These signals are
expected to be detected by the Chimera approach, but not by single
codon measures of codon usage bias.

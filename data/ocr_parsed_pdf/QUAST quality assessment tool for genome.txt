QUAST

 

QUAST uses the Nucmer aligner from MUMmer v3.23 (Kurtz et al.,
2004) to align assemblies to a reference genome and evaluate metrics
depending on alignments. QUAST also computes metrics that are
useful for assessing assemblies of previously unsequenced species, whereas
most other assembly assessment software require a reference genome.

We will split the metrics evaluated by QUAST into several groups.
Most have been used in previous studies, but some are new to QUAST.

2.1.1 Contig Sizes The following metrics (except for NGx) can be
evaluated with or without a reference genome. We also provide ﬂltered
versions of them, restricted to contigs of length above a speciﬁed min-
imum size, to exclude short contigs that may not be of much use.

0 No. of contigs: The total number of contigs in the assembly.
o Largest contig: The length of the largest contig in the assembly.
o Total length: The total number of bases in the assembly.

o NX (where 0 5 X 5 100): The largest contig length, L, such that
using contigs of length 2 L accounts for at least X% of the bases
of the assembly.

o NGX, Genome NX: The contig length such that using equal or longer
length contigs produces X% of the length of the reference genome,
rather than X% of the assembly length.

2.1.2 M isassemblies and structural variations The following met-
rics describe structural errors in the contigs. QUAST can evaluate them
only with respect to a known reference genome. If the reference genome
exactly matches the dataset being assembled, differences may be attrib-
uted to misassemblies by the software or to sequencing errors, such as
chimeric reads. Sometimes one uses a reference genome that is related to
but different than the dataset being sequenced. In this case, the differences
may still be misassemblies, but they may also be true structural variations,
such as rearrangements, large indels, different repeat copy numbers and
so forth.

0 No. of misassemblies: The number of misassemblies, using
Plantagora’s deﬂnition. Plantagora deﬁnes a misassembly breakpoint
as a position in the assembled contigs where the left ﬂanking se-
quence aligns over 1 kb away from the right ﬂanking sequence on
the reference, or they overlap by >1 kb, or the ﬂanking sequences
align on opposite strands or different chromosomes. QUAST also
generates a report with the number of misassemblies because of each
of these reasons. See the Supplementary Methods for details.

0 No. of misassembled contigs: The number of contigs that contain
misassembly breakpoints.

M isassembled contigs length: The total number of bases contained in
all contigs that have one or more misassemblies.

No. of unaligned contigs: The number of contigs that have no align-
ment to the reference sequence.

0 No. of ambiguously mapped contigs: The number of contigs that have
high-scoring reference alignments of equal quality in multiple loca-
tions on the reference genome.

o In addition to these summary statistics, QUAST also generates re-
ports with detailed information about each contig, including whether
the contig is unaligned, ambiguously mapped, misassembled or
correct.

2.1.3 Genome representation and its functional elements This sec-
tion lists metrics evaluating genome representation in contigs and the
number of assembled functional elements, such as genes and operons.
Most of these require a reference genome.

o Genome fraction (%): The total number of aligned bases in the ref-
erence, divided by the genome size. A base in the reference genome is

counted as aligned if at least one contig has at least one alignment to
this base. Contigs from repeat regions may map to multiple places,
and thus may be counted multiple times in this quantity.

Duplication ratio: The total number of aligned bases in the assembly
(i.e. total length minus unaligned contigs length), divided by the total
number of aligned bases in the reference [see the genome fraction (%)
metric]. If the assembly contains many contigs that cover the same
regions of the reference, its duplication ratio may be much >1. This
may occur due to overestimating repeat multiplicities and due to
small overlaps between contigs, among other reasons.

GC (%): The total number of G and C nucleotides in the assembly,
divided by the total length of the assembly. This metric can be com-
puted without a reference genome.

o No. of mismatches per 100 kb: The average number of mismatches per
100 000 aligned bases. QUAST also generates a more detailed report
with the coordinates of mismatches. This metric does not distinguish
between single-nucleotide polymorphisms, which are true differences
in the assembled genome versus the reference genome, and
single-nucleotide errors, which are due to errors in reads or errors
in the assembly algorithm.

0 No. of indels per 100kb: The average number of single nucleotide
insertions or deletions per 100 000 aligned bases. A detailed report
with coordinates of indels for all assemblies is also available.

o No. of genes: The number of genes in the assembly (complete and
partial), based on a user-provided annotated list of gene positions in
the reference genome. A gene is partially covered if the assembly
contains at least 100 bp of the gene but not the whole gene.
QUAST also reports a list of the completely covered genes for
each assembly. If an annotated list of gene positions is not available,
this metric cannot be computed, but the number of predicted genes
(see later in the text) can be used instead.

No. of operons: Complete and partial operons are counted in a simi-
lar fashion to genes, using a user-provided annotated list of operon
positions in the reference genome.

No. of predicted genes: The number of genes in the assembly pre-
dicted by QUAST’s gene-ﬂnding module, which is based on
GeneMark.hmm (Lukashin and Borodovsky 1998) for prokaryotes
and GlimmerHMM (Majoros et al., 2004) for eukaryotes. The
GeneMark.hmm authors have kindly allowed use of their software
inside QUAST, and GlimmerHMM is an open-source tool. If the
user provides a reference genome with an annotated list of genes, we
use the number of genes statistic instead. Otherwise, QUAST counts
the number of genes annotated by GeneMark.hmm or
GlimmerHMM and then ﬂlters them to count only those with
lengths above one or more speciﬂed minimum thresholds.

2.1.4 Variations of N50 based on aligned blocks The following
metrics in QUAST are new, but they have similarities with GAGE’s
‘corrected Nx’ (Salzberg et al., 2011), Assemblathon’s ‘contig path Nx
over alignment graph’ (Earl et al., 2011) and the ‘normalized N50’
(Makinen et al., 2012) metric. Here, we give short descriptions for these
metrics. See the Supplementary Methods for more detailed information.

NAX (A stands for aligned; X ranges from 07100): This is a combin-
ation of the well-known Nx metric and Plantagora’s number of misas-
semblies metric. It is computed in two steps. First, we break the contigs
into aligned blocks. If a contig has misassembly breakpoints (per the
previous deﬁnition from Plantagora), it is broken into multiple blocks
at these breakpoints. Additionally, if there are unaligned regions within a
contig, these regions are removed, and the contig is split into blocks.
Next, we compute the ordinary Nx statistic on these blocks instead of
on the original contigs.

and has the smallest number of contigs (283), but SPAdes has a larger
NGA50 than IDBA-UD (99913 versus 90 607 bp) and assembled a
higher percentage of the genome (96.99 versus 95.90%). SPAdes also
assembled the highest number of complete genes (4071 of 4324), with
IDBA-UD a close second (4030). However, both SPAdes and
IDBA-UD have more misassemblies than the three Velvet-based
assemblers.

Figure 1 shows how the contigs align to the reference genome and
reveals high similarity between some of the assemblies. E+V-SC, Velvet
and Velvet-SC generated assemblies with dozens of similar contigs; this is
natural because all of these assemblers are modiﬁcations of Velvet. The
top track shows the read coverage along the genome. Velvet was not able
to assemble low-coverage regions of the genome, whereas the assemblers
designed for single-cell datasets (Velvet-SC, E+V-SC, SPAdes and
IDBA-UD) did much better, although, of course, none of them can
assemble the regions that literally have zero coverage.

3 CONCLUSION

Many assembly algorithms have been developed for the challen—
ging problem of genome assembly from short reads. Our new
open—access quality assessment tool QUAST will help scientists
to assess different assembly software to choose the best pipeline
for their research, and it will help developers of genome assem—
blers to improve their software and algorithms.

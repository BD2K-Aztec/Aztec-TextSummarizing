Abstract

Motivation: The 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP) and thousands of Genome—Wide Association Studies
(GWAS) performed during the last years have generated an enormous amount of information that
needs to be integrated to better understand the genetic architecture of complex diseases in different
populations. This integration is important in areas such as genetics, epidemiology, anthropology,
as well as admixture mapping design and GWAS—replications. Network—based approaches that ex—
plore the genetic bases of human diseases and traits have not yet incorporated information on gen—
etic diversity among human populations.

Results: We propose Disease—ANCEstry networks (DANCE), a graph—based web tool that allows to in—
tegrate and visualize information on human complex phenotypes and their GWAS—hits, as well as
their risk allele frequencies in different populations. DANCE provides an interactive way to explore
the human SNP—Disease Network and its projection, a Disease—Disease Network. With these func—
tionalities, DANCE fills a gap in our ability to handle and understand the knowledge generated
by GWAS and 1KGP. We provide a number of case studies that show how DANCE can be used to ex—
plore the relationships between human complex diseases, their genetic bases and variability in different
human populations.

Availability and implementation: DANCE is freely available at http://ldgh.com.br/dance/.
We recommend using DANCE with Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Chrome or Internet Explorer (v9 or v10).

1 Introduction

Information on human diversity and complex human phenotypes
are currently organized in independent databases. The 1000
Genomes Project (1KGP) (Auton et (11., 2015) database contains in—
formation on the spectrum of genetic variants in different human
populations. The NHGRI—EBI GWAS Catalog (Welter et (11., 2014)
contains information on the genetic architecture of complex diseases

and traits. Despite the importance of this information, there are no
tools to summarize, integrate and Visualize it, which is critical for a
Wide spectrum of areas such as genetics, epidemiology, anthropol—
ogy, to design admixture mapping or GWAS—replications and to test
the genetic architecture of diseases in different populations.
Relationships between human phenotypes and their causing gen—
etic variants have been modeled using network—based approaches,

which provide a comprehensive and integrated view of phenotypes
interrelations (Barabasi et al., 2011). Despite the fact that differ—
ences in allele frequencies can account for unequal phenotype preva—
lences among populations, current network approaches do not
integrate this information. Here, we present Disease—ANCEstry
networks (DANCE), a graph—based web tool that allows to organize
and visualize information on human complex phenotypes and their
GWAS—hits, together with their allele frequencies in African,
European and Asian populations.

2 DANCE

DANCE integrates information from two existing databases: (i)
GWAS—hit SNPs reported in the NHGRI—EBI GWAS Catalog and
(ii) risk—allele frequencies in Europeans, Africans and Asians from
the 1KGP. From the complete list of SNPs and associated pheno—
types provided by the first database, we selected 495 phenotypes
and 8019 SNPs with specified risk—alleles.

Data can be visualized with two network structures/projections, an
SNP—Disease network and a Disease—Disease network. The former is a
bipartite network where nodes are phenotypes or GWAS—hits SNPs.
Different phenotypes interconnect through shared SNPs. Population in—
formation is represented as a property of the SNP node, and includes
the risk—allele frequency in a specific continental population, or a popu—
lation pairwise allele frequency differentiation statistics Fs-r (Hartl and
Clark, 1998). The Disease—Disease network is the edge—weighted pro—
jection of the SNP—Disease Network, where two phenotypes are linked
only if they share GWAS—hits. Weights are based on the Jaccard’s
Coefficient overlap index (Salton and McGill, 1986), and phenotype
nodes are annotated using the Medical Subject Headings.

DANCE users can explore and visualize subnetvvorks of both the
SNP—Disease and the Disease—Disease networks. They can inter—
actively perform four tasks: (i) identify and visualize the set of SNPs
associated with a phenotype, including their risk—allele continental
frequencies and their pairwise Fs-r; (ii) identify and visualize GWAS—
hits from a particular gene and the associations with phenotypes,
including their risk—allele continental frequencies or their pairwise
PST; (iii) identify and visualize shared associations between two or
more phenotypes by neighborhood visualization; and (iv) explore
the Disease—Disease Network to identify clusters of phenotypes
sharing risk—alleles.

Figure 1A presents, as a case study, the SNP—Disease Network for
bipolar disorder and neighboring phenotypes. We observe that bipolar
disorder and four other neuropsychiatric disorders (depression, autism,
schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) share vari—
ous risk—alleles, forming a large cluster. Besides, bipolar disorder is
linked with suicide by two risk—alleles and with ulcerative colitis by one
risk—allele. This large cluster of neuropsychiatric disorders also appears
in the Disease—Disease Network (Supplementary Fig. S4). To identify
which SNPs account for this cluster, we analyze the annotation table,
available below the network view on the web interface. We find that
the cluster is formed by 54 risk—alleles, from which 28 are mapped to
genes and 26 are intergenic. We identify nine risk—alleles shared only by
bipolar disorder and depression, six by bipolar disorder and schizo—
phrenia and five by these three phenotypes. In addition, by looking at
the risk—allele frequencies we see that five of them are fixed in Asians
(frequency : 1), two of them are in TCF4 (transcription factor 4) and
three in KIF5C (kinesin family member 5C). Further investigation of
these genes is possible through the selection of the Gene filter. Figure
1B depicts the TCF4 gene network colored according to risk—allele fre—
quency in Asians. We note that TCF4 SNPs links to other four

types and (B) TCF4. SNPs are colored according to risk-allele frequency in
Africans (A) and Asians (B)

phenotypes besides the neuropsychiatric disorders. Three out of 11
risk—alleles of the network are non—polymorphic in Asians (one has fre—
quency equal to 1, and the other two equal to 0), one is almost fixed
(frequency : 0.997) and two are very rare (frequency 30.004). This
pattern of less diversity is common for other genes and phenotypes for
the Asian population, and Li et al. (2010) reported this low diversity of
TCF4 risk—alleles. In our dataset, Asians show 602 non—polymorphic
risk—alleles out of 8019; on the other hand, Europeans show 11, and
Africans seven fixed alleles. Indeed, with DANCE users can assess dif—
ferences in risk—allele frequencies among populations even when there
is no GWAS available for the population of interest, although caution
is necessary because the genetic architecture of a disease may not be en—
tirely shared by different populations.

In the Supplementary material, we present two additional case
studies. The first shows obesity—related networks, highlighting the
overlap of this condition with the well—known Duffy Antigen
Receptor gene, and detailing the connections of the obesity—related
FTO gene (through the Gene filter). Second, we explore the
Disease—Disease Network of Alzheimer’s disease and find that it is
linked to other five phenotypes through only one SNP risk—allele
localized in TOMM40 gene, which we explore further.

All information used to construct the DANCE networks is avail—
able as tables that can be visualized, re—sorted or exported. Detailed
information about DANCE implementation is in the Supplementary
material. DANCE is periodically updated to incorporate the latest
versions of 1KGP and GWAS—Catalog databases.

3 Conclusions

DANCE fills a gap in our ability to handle and understand the
knowledge generated by the 1KGP and GWAS initiatives, being the

first SNP—disease network—based approach that incorporates popu—
lation genetic variability.

DANCE is user—friendly, intuitive and interactive, and therefore,
is also used by its authors as an educational tool at undergraduate
and graduate levels. We expect it to inspire similar tools to study
the genetic architecture of complex traits in model organisms such
as Drosoploila or mice. As future work, we plan to represent
the population where GWAS were performed, SNPs effect size and
linkage disequilibrium, and allele frequencies for other populations
such as Native Americans.

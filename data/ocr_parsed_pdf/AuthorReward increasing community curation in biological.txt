A wiki page contains a collection of knowledge on a speciﬁc
subject, where multiple researchers are most likely to collabora—
tively provide edits. AuthorReward aims to provide a viable
quantiﬁcation for researchers’ contributions in bio—wikis. A
major concern to automated authorship has been ensuring that
authorship cannot be ‘manipulated’ by spurious, short—lived edits
(Supplementary Text Sl). For any wiki page p, we assume there
are a series of edit versions v0, v1, v2, . . ., v", where version v0 is
empty and n>0. AuthorReward counts multiple successive ver—
sions edited by a researcher as one version. Thus, any neighbor—
ing versions, vi_ 1 and v,- (where l g i g n), are edited by different
researchers. The edit distance between v,- and VI, termed as d(v,-, V)
(where i< j), is computed by the Levenshtein distance (LD)
(Levenshtein, 1966) that measures the minimum number of
edit operations (insertions, deletions and substitutions) required
to transform one string into the other. In AuthorReward, the
contribution score of version v,—, CS(v,-), is formulated straightfor—
wardly as

CS(v,~) = c[d(v,~,1, v") — (1(Vi, VD], (1)

where c is the scale factor, d(v,-_ 1, v") is the edit distance between
v,—_1 and v" and d(v,-, v") is the edit distance between v,- and v".

In Equation (1), CS(v,-) factors edit quality as well as edit
quantity in an implicit manner; the edit quantity of version v,—,
QT Y (vi), amounts to the edit distance between v,- and its previous
version v,—_ 1, viz., d(v,-_1, v,-) [Equation (2)], and the edit quality
of version v,—, QAL(v,-), corresponds to whether the edit persists in
comparison with the last version v" [Equation (3)].

QTY(Vi) = “IVH, Vi) (2)

(10H, v") — (Kw, v")

(1(Vi71, Vi) 

QAL(V.~) =
According to the triangle inequality, QAL(v,-) ranges from —1,
when the edits were entirely reverted, to +1, indicating that the
edits were totally preserved in the last version. Therefore,
QAL(v,-), in other words, measures how long the edit lasts in
the latest version; a high (or low) quality score is given for ver—
sion v,—, if it is long—lived (or short—lived). Consequently, CS(v,-)
can be expressed by QT Y(v,—) multiplied by QAL(v,-), namely,
CS(v,-)=QTY(v,—) >< QAL(v,-). Thus, CS(v,-) is not easily gamed,
providing a viable quantif1cation for researchers’ contributions.
Considering that one researcher may provide many discon—
tinuous edits across the evolution of a wiki page, and thereby
contribute multiple versions in one wiki page, the contribution
score of researcher r in page p, S(r, p), is quantified as the sum
over all contributed versions,

5(a)): ZCSm), (4)
vieE(r, p)

where E(r, p) is a set of versions contributed by researcher r in
page p. As a consequence, the total contribution of researcher r
in a bio—wiki is termed as the sum of multiple contribution scores
in all participated pages,

where P is a set of pages in which researcher r provides edits.

3 APPLICATION AND FEATURES

To test the functionality of AuthorReward, we installed it in
RiceWiki (http://ricewiki.big.ac.cn). For testing purposes, we
chose the semi—dwarf1ng gene (sdI), which is one of the most
important genes deployed in modern rice breeding and is also
known as the ‘green revolution gene’ affecting plant height of
rice. There were nine researchers collaboratively annotating the
50’] gene, providing 87 versions as of August 23, 2012
(Supplementary Table S2; http://ricewiki.big.ac.cn/index.php/
Os01g0883800).

As testiﬁed on the 50’] gene (Supplementary Fig. S1),
AuthorReward is capable of yielding sensible quantitative contri—
butions and providing automated explicit authorship, consistent
well with perceptions of all participated contributors. Moreover,
AuthorReward features good compatibility with any MediaWiki—
based system and simple installation, consequently possessing a
broad scope for its application and providing a consistent
appearance and functionality as Wikipedia.

4 CONCLUSION

AuthorReward provides bio—wikis with an authorship metric, fea—
turing robust contribution quantiﬁcation and automated explicit
authorship. When contribution is appropriately quantiﬁed and
authorship is duly rewarded, it is possible to exploit the full
potential of the scientiﬁc community in knowledge curation.

Although AuthorReward does not contribute directly to the
integration of biological knowledge, it provides a standard prac—
tice to reward community—curated efforts, which in return can
increase community participation in bio—wikis for knowledge
curation. Thus, our intention here is to produce an automated,
simple and robust authorship metric and no automated measure
will be able to gauge scientif1c content. AuthorReward can be
used in combination with semantic web technologies, potentially
promising a significant advance for harnessing community intel—
ligence for knowledge curation. In addition, social rewarding
techniques (e.g. peer rating) can be used together with
AuthorReward for contribution evaluation. Moreover, it is
likely in the long term to integrate community—curated efforts
across multiple bio—wikis for each researcher, which accordingly
requires close collaborations among bio—wikis and standardized
mechanisms for individual identity recognition (e.g. OpenID at
http ://www.openid.net).

AuthorReward provides a standard practice to reward commu—
nity—curated efforts in bio—wikis, and it is of interest to the sci—
entif1c community intending to perform knowledge curation
collectively and collaboratively in bio—wikis and also other
domain wikis.

Abstract

Motivation: Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) are genetic variants that affect gene expres—
sion. In eQTL studies, one important task is to find eGenes or genes whose expressions are associ—
ated with at least one eQTL. The standard statistical method to determine whether a gene is an
eGene requires association testing at all nearby variants and the permutation test to correct for
multiple testing. The standard method however does not consider genomic annotation of the vari—
ants. In practice, variants near gene transcription start sites (TSSs) or certain histone modifications
are likely to regulate gene expression. In this article, we introduce a novel eGene detection method
that considers this empirical evidence and thereby increases the statistical power.

Results: We applied our method to the liver Genotype—Tissue Expression (GTEx) data using dis—
tance from TSSs, DNase hypersensitivity sites, and six histone modifications as the genomic anno—
tations for the variants. Each of these annotations helped us detected more candidate eGenes.
Distance from TSS appears to be the most important annotation; specifically, using this annotation,
our method discovered 50% more candidate eGenes than the standard permutation method.

1 Introduction

Many studies over the past decade examined the contribution of
genetic loci to phenotypic variation in complex traits. Genetic loci
that are associated with gene expression are called expression quan—
titative trait loci (eQTLs) (Brem and Kruglyak, 2005; Gilad et (11.,
2008; The GTEx Consortium, 2015). One important task in eQTL
studies is to find eGenes or genes whose expressions are associated
with at least one genetic variant. The standard method to determine
whether a gene is an eGene requires association testing at all vari—
ants near the gene (cis—variants) and the permutation test to correct
for multiple testing. The permutation test is the gold standard for
multiple—testing correction, as it properly accounts for the linkage
disequilibrium (LD) structure in the genome.

However, this standard method does not consider which variants
are more likely to regulate gene expression. In order to better detect
eGenes, we can increase the statistical power of this standard
method by using annotation data. In practice, regulatory variants
found near the transcription start sites (T555) and certain histone
modifications are more likely to be associated with gene expression
(van de Geijn et (11., 2015). Additionally, recent large—scale genomics

studies have annotated regions of the genome that are likely to alter
gene expression in individuals (Ernst and Kellis, 2015; The
Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium, 2015). For example,
almost 80% of the chip—based heritability of disease risk for 11
human diseases examined in the Wellcome Trust Case Control
Consortium (WTCCC) can be explained by genome variation in
DNase I hypersensitivity sites. These variations are likely to regulate
chromatin accessibility and thus transcription (Gusev et (11., 2014).
These genomic annotations for the variants can be used to increase
the power to detect eGenes.

Although several methods were recently developed to address
challenges in multiple—testing correction in eQTL studies, these
methods do not improve statistical power in comparison to the
standard method. Sul et al. (2015) improved the runtime of the
standard permutation test by replacing the permutation procedure
with sampling from the multivariate normal distribution (Mvn).
Davis et al. (2016) further improved this runtime by estimating the
effective number of tests based on the eigen—decomposition of the
genotype correlation matrix. These methods aim to reduce runtime
but do not attempt to increase statistical power of the standard

approach. Therefore, these methods are not capable of detecting
more eGenes.

In this article, we introduce a new method for discovering
eGenes (Func—eGene) that uses genomic annotation of the variants
to increase statistical power. Although gene expression can be af—
fected by trans—variants (Bryois et (11., 2014), in this article, we focus
on methods to detect cis—acting eQTLs. We rely on the multi—
threshold association test that specifies different significance thresh—
olds for the variants when correcting for multiple testing (Darnell
et (11., 2012; Eskin, 2008). In this multi—threshold association study
mindset, we can assign less stringent significance thresholds to vari—
ants that have a high propensity to contribute to gene expression,
thereby increasing power. If an appropriate prior is provided, this
multi—threshold association method has a closed—form solution that
guarantees the best statistical power for the association test (Darnell
et (11., 2012). However, there are two key difficulties we encounter
when directly applying this multi—threshold association study
method to discover eGenes. First, the multi—threshold association
test depends on a permutation test to correct for LD. This permuta—
tion test is slow when applying to a large dataset. Second, we rarely
know of an appropriate prior based on the annotation for genetic
variants under study.

Our new method Func—eGene avoids these difficulties. To reduce
runtime, we replace the permutation test with the sampling proced—
ure in Sul et al. (2015). To find an appropriate prior, we do a grid
search over possible sets of scores assigned to annotation categories.
The goal of our search is to find the set of scores that maximizes the
number of eGenes. To avoid data re—use and over—fitting, we use a
cross—validation strategy.

We applied our method to the liver dataset from the Genotype
Tissue Expression (GTEx) Consortium. First, we used the distance
from the TSS as a genomic annotation because variants near the TSS
are likely to affect gene expression. Using this annotation alone, our
method Func—eGene increased the number of candidate eGenes by
5 0% compared with the standard method. Then, we added DNase
hypersensitivity sites as a second genomic annotation. The TSS and
DNase annotations together did not discover more candidate
eGenes than the TSS annotation alone. Third, we separately applied
the binding sites for histones H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K4me1,
H3K4me3, H3K9ac and H3K9me3 as genomic annotations. These
histone marks found more candidate eGenes than the standard
method but less than the number reported by using the TSS annota—
tion alone. Distance from TSS appears to create the most inform—
ative prior for detecting eGenes.

2 Methods

2.1 Standard method to detect eGenes

An eGene is a gene that has an associated eQTL (Sul et al. 2015).
Let s be a test statistic such as a t—distributed statistic from Pearson
or Spearman correlation between a genetic variant and gene expres—
sion. Define F(s) as its cumulative density function. Suppose or, is the
desired false—positive rate. In a two—tailed hypothesis test, assuming
that the distribution is symmetric, 2(1 —  is the P—value, and
:F‘1(1 — org/2) defines the rejection region for s. We use (30qu to
specify a matrix x of dimension p X q. Parentheses and subscripts
are omitted whenever the context is clear.

2.1.1 Association test
Suppose that there are N individuals. In the simplest scenario, which
considers only one variant and one gene y, the hypothesis test tests

whether gene expression (ey)NX1 of y is independent of the variant
genotype gNX1. If they are independent, the variant is not an eQTL
and y is not an eGene. The null hypothesis H0 is that y is not an
eGene, and the alternative hypothesis H1 is that y is an eGene. To
conduct this single hypothesis test, the standard method assumes a
linear model

eszb+gﬁ+e (1)

In Equation 1, the design matrix XNXp contains P fixed effects
(i.e. gender, ethnicity, age, etc.). The vector bpx1 is their regression
coefficients. If is the regression coefficient of the variant genotypes.
ENX1 is a vector of independent sampling errors that is normally dis—
tributed (eNX1 N N (0, Ia2)). In Equation 1, linear regression is used
to estimate 0 and its variance 3% .

Our test statistic s is the normalized ﬁ (5 : ﬁ/Eﬁ). Under the null
hypothesis, 5 follows a t—distribution with N — P — 1 degrees of free—
dom. If we suppose N is large, then F(s) z (1),,(5) where (1),, is a nor—
mal cumulative density with mean u and variance one. This mean u
is also known as the z—score non—centrality parameter. Our null and
alternative hypotheses can then be written as

Ho: GeneyisnotaneGene <—> Ho : u : 0
H1: GeneyisaneGene<—>H1zuzwwherewaé 0

H0 is rejected if the P—value is less than or. This P—value is named
eGene P—value (Sul et (11., 2015).

2.1.2 Multi—association test

In a more common scenario, many variants in—cis with gene y are
tested. In this case, the test consists of M univariate association tests.
The hypothesis test tests whether the expression (ey)NX1 of y is inde—
pendent of all variant genotypes (g,-)NX1 (i : 1 . . .M). As before, one
assumes

eyZXb+giﬁi+5i i:1"‘M (2)

In Equation 2, XNXp contains P fixed effects, and bpx1 is their re—
gression coefficients. [3,- is the regression coefficient for the genotypes
of variant 1'. (6,)le is a vector of independent sampling errors, and
follows (5,)le ~ N(0, 102). In Equation 2, linear regression is again

. A . . A2
used to est1mate l},- and Its var1ance air}.
.

Our test statistic s,- is the normalized l},- (s, : [ii/Eff). Let u,- be the
expected value of each test statistic 5,. We write the hypothesis as

Ho : Geneyis notaneGene <—> Ho : u,- : 0foralli
H1 : GeneyisaneGene <—> H1 :ui : w,- (3)
where w,- # 0 for some i6 {1 . . .M}

We then compute the P—value at each variant 1' and reject H0 if
their minimum P—value 9’ is less than as (Sul et (11., 2015). as is the
false—positive rate adjusted for multiple testing. For example, if
Bonferonni correction is applied, arc : or/ M. Bonferonni correction is
conservative because it ignores linkage—disequilibrium among the vari—
ants. The permutation test is thus the gold standard method (Sul
et (11., 2015).

2.2 Functional annotation—based multi—threshold
eGene (Func—eGene)

The standard method applies an identical univariate association test
to each variant and uses the minimum P—value as a test statistic. This
is equivalent to assigning to all variants a uniform prior of being
associated with the gene expression. However, we often have

D. Duong et al.

 

annotations that specify whether the variants are in some regulatory
regions of the genome. We developed a new method named Func—
eGene that considers this evidence to increase statistical power to
find candidate eGenes.

2.2.1 Multi—threshold association test

Our Func—eGene is built upon the multi—threshold association test
method that assigns different significance thresholds to different hy—
pothesis tests (Darnell et al., 2012; Eskin, 2008). We brieﬂy describe
their method here, assuming that we have data about the relative im—
portance of the genetic variants in our study. Let this information
about the M variants be given as 61 .. .cM, where  c,- : 1 and
c,- 2 0 for all i. For example, regulatory variants can be assigned
higher 6,- than those which are not. We assume that 61 . . . CM are
given beforehand. Later, we drop this assumption and determine an
appropriate 61 . . . CM from the data.

Darnell et al. (2012) and Eskin (2008) use this data to create a non—
uniform prior in the hypothesis test by giving the M observed statistics
51 . . .sM their own thresholds t1 . . . m, which are functions of c1 . . . CM.
These t,- must be corrected for multiple testing by using the constraint
1 t,- : or, where or is the genome—wide false—positive rate. This con—
straint holds only if the variants are independent. Later, we remove this
requirement and properly account for LD. We then maximize the statis—
tical power of the hypothesis test, which is a function of ti.

Statistical power is defined as the probability of an observed stat—
istic being significant when the alternative hypothesis is true. In the
simplest case, there is only one variant 1' and the gene y. The power
of the two—tail hypothesis test denoted as P5(t,-, m) is the probability
that (5,) > F_1(1 — ti/2) when the true mean of s,- is not zero.
Suppose N is large so that P5(t,-, hi) can be approximated using the
standard normal cumulative density (I).

P5023111) = [WI-92') > F_1(1 - ti/2)) (4a)
2 <1>(<D_1(ti/2)- #1") + 1 - (WP—1U - ti/Z) - #1") (4b)

In a more common scenario, one considers M variants in—cis
with gene y. The statistical power to detect y being an eGene
denoted as P(t1...tM) is the weighted average over M variants,
P(t1 . . . tM) :  ciPS(t,-, m). For a more detailed discussion of this
definition, see Eskin (2008) and Rubin et al. (2006).

Darnell et al. (2012) and Eskin (2008) find t1 . . . tM so that the
statistical power P(t1 . . . m) is maximized under the constraint
2:1 t,- : or and t,- Z 0 for all i. This solution is obtained by taking
the gradient of the Lagrangian $(£,t1...tM) with respect to the
Lagrangian multiplier Z, and the unknown variables t1 . . . tM.

Optimal solution is achieved when VtiLM, t1 . . . tM) : VtiLM, t1
. . . W) for all i,/' E {1 . . .M} (Eskin, 2008). Moreover, this equality
has a closed form (Darnell et al., 2012)

c.(¢>,,<<I>-1<t.-/2>> + <z>_,.,.<<1>-1 (ti/2») /2
<1>o((1)_1 (ti/2))
c,- (<z>,,.<<1>-1 (ti/2)) + <z>_,.,.<<1>-1 (ti/2>>)/2
‘ murky/2))

(5)

The symbol (1)2 is the probability density function of a normal
distribution having mean z and variance one. (13—100) is the quantile
of to under a normal distribution of mean zero and variance one.

Once the observed statistics 51 ...5M are estimated, we compare
their P—values p,- : 2(1 —  to t1 . . . m. If pi< t,, then variant 1' is
an eQTL. If at least one variant is an eQTL, then the gene is an
eGene.

This method can be used to calculate the multiple—testing—cor—
rected P—values 17’; “.1734. In fact, finding per—marker significance
thresholds and computing the corrected P—value are two related
tasks in multiple—testing correction. Brieﬂy, to obtain the corrected
P—value pf, we begin with a small or", find optimal t’l‘ . . . tfn with con—
straint  t? : or" in which case t? < 17,- due to small or". We repeat
this analysis while increasing or" until t? : 17,-. or" will be our cor—
rected P—value pf. If pf < at, then variant 1' is an eQTL. If any of the
variants is an eQTL, then the gene is an eGene. The multiple—testing—
corrected eGene P—value becomes

FZGene :  

Comparing 17,- against t,- and comparing pf against or give identical
eQTLs and eGenes. These are two different viewpoints of the same
multiple—testing correction.

2.2.2 LD-corrected P-value
When LD among the variants is unignorable, corrected P—values pf
and eGene P—value pZGme violate the independence assumption and
become conservative. To avoid this, Darnell et al. (2012) and Eskin
(2008) suggested using a permutation test to compute pZGme.
Because these studies did not describe in detail how a permutation
test is done, we explain the procedure here. We do one permutation
by permuting the expression measurements among the individuals
while keeping their genotype data unchanged so that LD is retained.
Leaving the LD intact keeps the correlation between the genotypes of
the individuals which then retains the correlation of the test statistics.
Suppose that we do such permutation B times. In the j—th permuta—
tion, we find M corrected P—values pZ-‘J- and their eGene P—value as
pzcﬂw. : min{p:-‘J-}£\:1 Let pZGmeﬁobS be the eGene P—value in the
observed data. Define the LD—corrected eGene P—value as
B
":1

* *
ﬂ(pEGEHE,ObS Z peGene,/)
I

*
peGene,LD-corrected : B 

where I is an indicator function. This LD—corrected eGene P—value is
not conservative and has correct false—positive rate. This permuta—
tion however is time—consuming. In each permutation, we need to
find the corrected P—values pf which requires a search for or" as
described above. Repeating this search B times makes the permuta—
tion test very time—consuming.

2.2.3 LR-based permutation test

To speed up the permutation test, Func—eGene uses the likelihood
ratio (LR). The permutation using P—values in Darnell et al. (2012)
and Eskin (2008) is slow because every permutation finds the cor—
rected P—value pf. Func—eGene uses a test statistic that does not re—
quire pf. To do this, we interpret Equation 5 as a LR multiplied by a
prior probability. Define g,(s,-) such that

c.(¢>,.,.<s.-> + <1-.. (a) /2
gift) I 

Equation 8 becomes a LR evaluated at s,- where Ho : [E(s,-) : 0

(8)

and H1 is an average of two two—tail hypotheses H1 : [E(s,-) : u,- and
H1 : IE(s,-) : —u,-.

Here g,(s,-) is a monotonic increasing in (5,). The key concept is that
we can replace pf in Equation 6 with g,(s,-). Define the eGene LR to be

geGene : max{gi($i)}f\:1

Let geGmeﬁobS be the observed eGene LR in the data computed as
in Equation 9 using the observed test statistics s1...sM. Define
gecmw- as the eGene LR computed as in Equation 9 using the test
statistics 511,-. . .SMJ' in the j—th permutation. The LD—corrected
P—value becomes

B

Z ﬂ(geGene,obs S geGenej)
[:1
FZGeneID-corrected : f 

and is equivalent to Equation 7. By using LR instead of P—value, we
avoid finding 17* and make the permutation test faster.

2.2.4 LR-based Mvn sampling

Even with the LR—based permuation test, the method’s runtime de—
pends on the number of individuals. To overcome this problem, we
observe that Equation 8 is a simple function in 5,. Applying the
method in Sul et al. (2015), we use the Mvn density instead of the
permutation test. We sample 5? . . .524 from a null density Mvn(0, 2).
EMX M measures the LD among the M variants, and is computed as
§ GTG where GNX M is the genotype data. When there are few indi—
viduals, the null density in the permutation test and one formed by

5? . . .524 are mismatched. Following Sul et al. (2015), we correct

5? . . .524 using the variant minor allele frequencies and the sam—

ple size. The corrected 5?...524 are used to compute gage“,- in

Equation 10.

2.2.5 Finding appropriate priors using genomic annotations
We demonstrated that Func—eGene can maximize statistical power
and approximate eGene P—values when the functional priors are
specified beforehand. However, these priors are hardly known a pri—
ori. In this section, we introduce a heuristic data—adaptive procedure
to determine an appropriate prior that can yield the most number of
candidate eGenes. Suppose we categorize the cis—variants using] dif—
ferent annotations. Each annotation / is given a score bi. A variant
belonging to / inherits its score. Define [2,,- E {0, 1} so that [2,72 1 if
the variant 1' belongs to j. The score 14,- at a variant 1' is defined as
I
MiZZbi/{ii (11)

i:1

The normalized prior 6,- at variant 1' is

 

(12)

where M is the number of variants. Equation 11 assumes that the
functional annotations behave in an additive manner. It is possible
to include interaction terms among the annotations, and the opti—
mization procedure below remains applicable. Equations 11 and 12
imply that Equations 8, 9 and 10 are functions of the annotation
scoreb : (b1 . . . b]).

Using these priors in Func—eGene, we calculate Equation 10. It is
important to see that Equation 8 is the product of c,- and the function
lo(s,-) :  Thus, we compute 17(si) from the observed data
only once, and then use them when evaluating eGene LR at each
pOSSible b to get FZGeneID-corrected‘

Our objective is to determine the optimal score 13* : (b’f . . . b?)
for the annotations that yield the most number of candidate eGenes.
One immediate but impractical solution is to search all possible 13.
To do this, Func—eGene must be run for each h to get the threshold
for the observed eGene LR in Equation 9, which corresponds to the

specified significance threshold or. This threshold is some upper or
quantile under a null density of gage“. This quantile depends on 13.
Let Q3, (1300) be the quantile threshold of gage“e at gene y, using some
k—th choice of b denoted as 130‘). If gee“,e > Q,,(b(k)), then y is an
eGene. Using these quantile thresholds, the number of eGenes can
be estimated for a choice 130‘).

Running Func—eGene for all h is time demanding. Thus, for find—
ing a good choice of b, we use the following procedure. We aim to
approximate quantile thresholds of all 13, while implementing Func—
eGene only once. One can pick a starting 13(0), compute Qy (13(0)) for
all genes y in the data. In each subsequent choice [2, find Q3, (1300) for
only a subset of genes, and estimate the ratio change of the quantile
threshold

00
5y(b(k)7b(0)) : Qy<b ) (13)

kamb

Determine the average 5(b(0),b(k)) using the 5y(b(k),b(0)) com—
puted over the subset. Use Q,,(b(0)) and 5(b(0),b(k)) to estimate
Q3, (1300) for all genes y in the data, assuming that the ratio Equation
13 changes only slightly for all the genes.

This procedure quickly calculates the observed eGene LR and its
threshold at all h, using the permutation test or the sampling scheme
in Sul et al. (2015 ) only once. We emphasize that this approximation
is based on a subset of genes and is best used for finding a good
choice 13*. After we find 13*, ideally, we would apply a complete
Func—eGene run using 13* to determine the number of eGenes.

Because we determine good choices for b from the data, data
re—use and over—fitting are two issues which can inﬂate the false—
positive rate. To avoid this, we use a cross—validation method that
divides the data into two subsets. We obtain best scores from one set
and apply these scores to find eGenes in the other set, and vice
versa.

3 Results

We applied our method Func—eGene to the GTEx dataset. The
GTEx pilot study collected 9365 tissue samples from more than 30
distinct tissues from 237 post—mortem donors and performed RNA—
seq to quantify gene expression in those tissues (The GTEx
Consortium, 2015). We used the liver tissue data that has 97 sam—
ples. All individuals were genotyped at 5M SNPs and imputed with
1000 Genomes Phase I as the reference panel. The number of genes
expressed in this tissue is 21 868.

3.1 Func—eGene controls false—positive rate

There are two ways to apply Func—eGene. Permutation Func—eGene
relies on the traditional permutation test to calculate the null density
of the observed statistic, whereas Mvn Func—eGene relies on the
Mvn—sampling procedure in Sul et al. (2015).

Simulations demonstrate that both the permutation and the Mvn
Func—eGene control the false—positive rate well. The gene
ENSG00000204219 . 5 expressed in the liver tissue is chosen as an
example. This gene belongs to chromosome 1 and has 3872 cis—
variants of which 431 are in the TSS region. For the sake of simpli—
city, variants in the TSS region are assumed 100 times more likely to
affect gene expression. The non—uniform priors are then specified
such that the ratio of priors for variants inside and outside TSS is
100/ 1. This ratio is reset to 1/1 in the uniform prior. In the alterna—
tive hypothesis, our method requires the true effects (i.e. z—score
non—centrality parameters) of the variants as input parameters MS.

In this experiment and onward, in the alternative hypothesis, we use
11,- : 3.5—this choice is addressed in Section 4.

To simulate gene expression data under the null hypothesis, we
permuted the gene expression measurements among the 97 individ—
uals and kept the genotype data unchanged. In each simulation, we
computed the eGene P—value using permutation and Mvn Func—
eGene with both uniform and non—uniform priors. We applied the
permutation procedure using 104 permutations and the Mvn method
using 106 samplings. Simulated eGene P—values under 0.05 are con—
sidered significant. Permutation and Mvn Func—eGene have false—
positive rates of 0.046 and 0.044, respectively, using a uniform
prior. Both have false—positive rates of 0.051 and 0.052, respect—
ively, using a non—uniform prior. Q—Q plots against the uniform
density illustrate that the simulated densities under the null hypoth—
esis match the uniform distribution well (Fig. 1(a)).

3.2 Func—eGene increases statistical power

An appropriate prior when applied in Func—eGene increases statis—
tical power to detect candidate eGenes. To demonstrate this, we
conducted simulation studies where there exists one variant that in—
duces the gene expression. The gene ENSGO O OO 02 042 l 9 . 5 is again
chosen as an example.

To simulate the gene expression measurements for 97 individ—
uals, we consider only variants within 150 kb up— and down—stream
of the TSS, and presume that the maximum absolute effects of these
variants (denoted as ﬁmax) to be the only genetic contribution to—
ward the gene expression.

Gene expression measurements are thus simulated as
(33, : gﬁmax + e where (ey)97X1 is the simulated gene expression meas—
urements, g97x1 is the genotype of the variant corresponding to
ﬁmax, and 697“ is sampled from Mvn(0, I02).

In our experiment, we vary this standard deviation (7 from 0.00
to 1.50 At each instance of a, we simulate 200 sets of gene expres—
sion data and compute the eGene P—value for each of them. The
simulated power at this a is the fraction of eGene P—values from the
200 simulated datasets that are less than 0.05. As we increase a, the
randomness effect dominates the effects of variants and the statis—
tical power to discover any association between a variant and the
gene expression diminishes.

We applied the uniform and non—uniform priors to the simulated
data. In the non—uniform prior, the ratio of prior for a variant inside
and outside the TSS region is 100/ 1. This non—uniform prior reﬂects
the fact that eQTLs tend to reside near the TSS. Figure 1 (b) indicates

3.3 Func—eGene discovers more candidate eGenes in
the liver GTEx data

Permutation and Mvn Func—eGene are applied to the liver GTEx data
which contains 21 868 quantile normalized gene expression measure—
ments across 22 autosomal chromosomes in 97 individuals. Both uni—
form and non—uniform priors are tested. Our goal in this experiment
is to demonstrate that: (i) using an informative non—uniform prior in—
creases the number of candidate eGenes and (ii) Mvn Func—eGene is a
good estimation of the gold—standard permutation test.

We computed eGene P—values by using 106 samplings for Mvn
Func—eGene and 104 permutations for the permutation Func—eGene
as indicated in the GTEx pilot analysis (The GTEx Consortium,
2015 ). The efficiency gain of Mvn sampling over the permutation
test diminishes when the number of cis—variants for a gene is much
greater than the number of sample size. Following Sul et al. (2015),
we divide the cis—variants for a gene into blocks of size 500 kb, and
apply Mvn sampling separately to each block. The most significant
P—value taken across these blocks is the eGene P—value.

Cis—variants are variants located within the 1 Megabase up— and
down—stream of TSS of a gene (The GTEx Consortium, 2015 ). In the
liver GTEx data, the average number of cis—variants per gene is 4681.
We define gene TSS—region to be 150 kb up— and down—stream of the
gene TSS. The average fraction of variants inside this region is 14.74%.

Spurious effects on gene expression might dominate the effects
of the cis—variants. To remove them, we regress out the following
covariates: the first three genotyping principal components, the first
15 expression Probabilistic Estimation of Expression Residuals
(PEER) factors, and gender (Stegle et al., 2012; The GTEx
Consortium, 2015 ). To be consistent with the GTEx pilot analysis,
we transform eGene P—values into Q—values to control the false dis—
covery rate over the entire sample. Genes having Q—values under
0.05 are considered eGenes (Storey and Tibshirani, 2003; The GTEx
Consortium, 2015 ).

For the sake of simplicity, non—uniform priors are assigned so
that the ratio of prior for a variant inside and outside the TSS region
is 100/1, an assumption we address later.

Using an informative non—uniform prior increases the number
of candidate eGenes in both permutation and Mvn Func—eGene
(Table 1). The number of candidate eGenes has increased by 50.4%

Mvn Func—eGene (from 15 82 to 2449) by applying non—uniform pri—
ors. The numbers were comparable between the two implementa—
tions, indicating that Mvn approximates the null distribution of
observed statistics well.

Sul et al. (2015) have shown that Mvn sampling and permuta—
tion test have comparable eGene P—values without using any prior.
Here we show that the results are also comparable when using a
non—uniform prior. Figure 2(a) compares Mvn eGene P—values
against those in the permutation test, and Figure 2(b) indicates the
Mvn method is at most :0.10 units from the gold—standard permu—
tation test P—values. Our Mvn method and the permutation test
agree on 2379 candidate eGenes. Because Mvn method is an ap—
proximation to the permutation test, we analyze the candidate
eGenes that the Mvn method misses and falsely discovers. Of the 66
missed eGenes, the maximum Q—value is 0.079 and the median is
0.053. Of the 70 falsely discovered eGenes, the minimum Q—value is
0.028 and the median 0.045. Thus, these misclassified eGenes are
genes with borderline Q—values.

The function Q—value in R requires that the distribution of input
P—values has a fairly ﬂat right tail (Storey and Tibshirani, 2003).
Our eGene P—values meet this condition (Fig. 3).

Figure 4(a) compares our eGene Q—values against those in the
permutation test, and Figure 4(b) indicates that accuracy of Mvn
Func—eGene is at most :0.05 units from the gold—standard permuta—
tion test Q—values.

3.4 Func—eGene chooses appropriate priors

So far, we have assumed that the priors are defined a priori. In this
section, we applied the method in Section 2.2.5 to determine appro—
priate priors from the data. To demonstrate this method, we con—
sider two functional annotations A755 and ADNase. A755 contains
variants within 150 kb of the TSS. ADN,lse contains variants within
the E066 DNase hypersensitivity narrow gapped peaks (http://egg2.
wustl.edu/roadmap/data) in the liver tissue. Across 21 868 auto—
somal genes, the average fraction of cis—variants belonging in the
A755 and the ADN,lse are 14.74% and 4.66%, respectively. The over—
lap between them is 0.88%.

The relative prior ratio between annotations can be represented
by three numbers, b1, 02 and 03, which correspond to the scores for
A755,ADN,lse and neither. For example, a variant in A755 has 01/02
times higher score than a variant in ADNase. Since the scores are
assumed to be additive in Equation 11, a variant in both A755 and
ADN,lse has (01 + bz)/b3 times higher score than a variant in neither
classes. We constrained each of b1, 02, and 03 to be between 100
times greater and 100 times smaller than the other two. Only the
relative ratios of the scores matter. Given this constraint, we did a
grid search over the parameter space evaluating a total of 441
choices of score b : (b1, 02, 03).

We implemented Mvn Func—eGene only once with the functional
scores hm) : (1,1,1). At each gene, we recorded the upper 1%
quantile of the observed statistics, which corresponds to the signifi—
cance threshold or : 0.01. We used this P—value threshold because
this threshold roughly corresponds to the maximum eGene P—value
of genes whose Q—values are under the threshold 0.05 in our data of
Section 3.3. Using this complete Mvn Func—eGene run at hm), we
computed new observed statistics and their thresholds at another
choice b(k) using the approximation method in Section 2.2.5.

We tested 441 choices of b. Table 2 displays 19 of these 441
choices and the number of candidate eGenes discovered using these
scores. The score b : (100.1.1) had the most candidate eGenes,
indicating that using A755 alone is enough to increase the number of
eGene discovered. For a few choices of b, we ran the Mvn Func—
eGene without using the approximation method, and the results are
comparable.

3.5 Evaluation using histone marks

Because there exist other genomic annotations, we hope to evaluate
their effects on eGene detection. Ideally, we would use all annota—
tions simultaneously in the model and find the optimal prior param—
eters. Unfortunately, our method uses grid search which is
prohibitively time—consuming in high dimensional space. For this
reason, we evaluate each annotation separately, which at least can
provide an overview of which annotation contains useful informa—
tion for eGene discovery.

We applied the optimization to six histone marks, A755, and
ADNase. In each annotation, we find the best prior ratio of the variants
inside and outside the annotated site. Table 3 indicates that using
these annotations can increase the number of candidate eGenes. These
numbers are from a complete Mvn Func—eGene run using all genes in
the liver tissue data and not from the method in Section 2.2.5. The
marks associated with activation of gene expression (H3K27ac,
H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9ac) have prior ratios more than one,
whereas the marks associated with suppression of gene expression
(H3K27me3, H3K9me3) have prior ratios less than one. All of the his—
tone marks yield more candidate eGenes than the uniform prior.

In Table 3, TSS has the best prior ratio at 60/1. This prior gives
more eGenes than the prior 100/1 reported in Table 1. Figure 5(a)
indicates that the false—positive rate at the gene
ENSG00000204219 . 5 using prior 60/1 matches well to the uni—
form density and is not inﬂated. Figure 5 (b) indicates that the simu—
lated statistical power at this gene using Mvn Func—eGene with the
prior ratio 60/1 is not worse than the guessed ratio 100/1. It is im—
portant to stress that the ratio 60/1 is best with respect to all the
genes in liver tissue data and not this particular gene.

3.6 Mvn Func—eGene has better runtime

than permutation method

Num. cis-variants per gene

Fig. 6. Permutation and Mvn Func-eGene runtime

samples, and the permutation—based procedure uses 1000 permuta—
tions. In both cases the number of individuals is 97. The standard
permutation method computes one eGene P—value in time linear in
the number of cis—variants for a gene (Sul et al., 2015 ). The
permutation—based Func—eGene relies on this basic permutation pro—
cedure and has almost identical runtime to the standard permutation
method. Figure 6 displays the runtime for a few randomly chosen
genes from the GTEx liver tissue data. Mvn Func—eGene is consider—
ably faster than permutation approaches but runs in polynomial
time. In the GTEx liver tissue data, the 5% upper quantile of cis—
variants per gene is 6833 variants. Thus in practice the polynomial
nature of the Mvn Func—eGene does not impede its application.

4 Discussion

In this article, we have introduced a new method Func—eGene that
relies on the association study methods in Darnell et al. (2012) and
Eskin (2008) and uses genomic annotations of the cis—variants to
create a non—uniform prior that can detect more eGenes. We applied
our method to the liver tissue dataset from the GTEx Consortium,
and the results indicate that distance from TSS appears to contain
enough information that is needed to find more candidate eGenes.
Our method has many layers of procedures which can be time—
consuming. To reduce runtime, we introduced many ideas. We em—
ployed LR statistic which is more efficient to obtain than a P—value
in a multi—threshold association study. We replaced the time—
consuming permutation test with the use of Mvn sampling. To avoid
reassessing significance thresholds at each new prior in our grid

search, we developed an approximation method which uses a subset
of the tested genes. Due to these heuristics, we were able to conduct
a grid search using TSS, DNase and six histone modifications as
functional classes. Because our method uses grid search where the
runtime increases exponentially with the number of annotations,
our current method is not yet applicable for simultaneously handling
a large number of annotations. One future goal is to develop a better
optimization method than a grid search.

Lastly, we address the fact that in the alternative hypothesis, the
true effects of the variants on the gene expression are unknown in
practice. It has been demonstrated in previous studies that different
choices of these effect sizes do not greatly change the outcome
(Darnell et al., 2012; Eskin, 2008). Another option is to consider
some continuous prior density on these true effects and then inte—
grate over their valid domain (Benner et al., 2016; Hormozdiari
et al., 2014, 2015). This idea is another future research plan.

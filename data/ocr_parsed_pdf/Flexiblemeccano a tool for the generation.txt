ABSTRACT

Motivation: Intrinsically disordered proteins (lDPs) represent
a significant fraction of the human proteome. The classical
structure function paradigm that has successfully underpinned our
understanding of molecular biology breaks down when considering
proteins that have no stable tertiary structure in their functional form.
One convenient approach is to describe the protein in terms of an
equilibrium of rapidly inter-converting conformers. Currently, tools to
generate such ensemble descriptions are extremely rare, and poorly
adapted to the prediction of experimental data.

Results: We present flexible-meccano—a highly efficient algorithm
that generates ensembles of molecules, on the basis of amino
acid-specific conformational potentials and volume exclusion.
Conformational sampling depends uniquely on the primary
sequence, with the possibility of introducing additional local or
long-range conformational propensities at an amino acid-specific
resolution. The algorithm can also be used to calculate expected
values of experimental parameters measured at atomic or molecular
resolution, such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and small
angle scattering, respectively. We envisage that flexible-meccano will
be useful for researchers who wish to compare experimental data
with those expected from a fully disordered protein, researchers who
see experimental evidence of deviation from ‘random coil’ behaviour
in their protein, or researchers who are interested in working with a
broad ensemble of conformers representing the flexibility of the IDP
of interest.

1 INTRODUCTION

The realization that a signiﬁcant percentage of the functional
proteins encoded in eukaryotic genomes are fully or partially

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

disordered in their functional state has revolutionized our
understanding of structural and molecular biology (Babu, 2012;
Dunker et al., 2002; Dyson and Wright, 2005; Tompa, 2002;
Uversky, 2002). Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), or proteins
containing long intrinsically disordered regions, do not adopt a stable
3D fold, and therefore fall beyond the scope of classical structural
biology. IDPs are biologically functional in the disordered state
imposing a very different perspective on the relationship between
primary protein sequence and function compared with the standard
structure/function relationship that underpins our understanding of
molecular biology. IDPs are implicated in a large number of human
pathologies, and the development of pharmacological solutions
to these problems awaits a molecular description of the role of
ﬂexibility in a number of diseases (Babu et al., 2011; Dunker and
Uversky, 2010; Vendruscolo and Dobson, 2007).

In order to understand the conformational behaviour of IDPs it
is essential to develop a molecular description of the disordered
state. The structural biology paradigm shifts when we consider
disordered proteins, so that the determination of a single structure
has no real physical relevance, or at best can only describe
isolated sub-states on a vast potential energy landscape. A structural
description of IDPs rather aims to determine rules that deﬁne
the behaviour of the ﬂexible protein in terms of probabilities
of populating different regions of conformational space, and to
correlate these probabilities with the function of the protein. The
description of conformational propensities can be conveniently
achieved by evoking an explicit ensemble description of inter-
converting structures in equilibrium.

Due to the very large number of degrees of freedom available to
such a disordered system, the problem of deﬁning conformational
space is highly underdetermined, requiring extensive experimental
data to delimit the structural propensities of a given protein.
Novel analytical tools are required to exploit the speciﬁc
conformational sensitivity of different experimental parameters.
Each experimental NMR parameter for example, is sensitive to
different aspects of the structural and dynamic behaviour of
the disordered state and requires speciﬁc consideration of the
relevant averaging properties of the physical interaction (Schneider
et al., 2012).

in terms of Ramachandran sampling for each amino acid)ithe default is the ﬂexible-meccano statistical coil description. This can be modiﬁed in terms

of additional propensities to form secondary structure, by modifying the amino acid-speciﬁc potentials or by introducing long-range contacts. Biophysical
parameters (radius of gyration and (15/10 sampling), and expected experimental parameters (shown ﬁguratively on the right, for example NMR RDCs, PREs
etc.) are calculated for this conformational regime, as well as explicit conformational ensemble of backbone conformers.

2 SYSTEM AND METHODS

The protocol that we present here describes the generation of explicit
ensemble descriptions of proteins, using the program ﬂexible-
meccano that has been explicitly developed to describe the behaviour
of IDPs and denatured proteins. Expected experimental parameters,
such as NMR and small angle scattering data, are calculated from the
conformational ensembles (Bernado et al., 2005a, b; Jensen et al.,
2008; Jensen et al., 2011; Mukrasch et al., 2007; Nodet et al., 2009;
Salmon et al., 2010; Wells et al., 2008). These parameters can then
be compared with experimental measurements. Amino acid-speciﬁc
statistical coil sampling is used to describe the unfolded state on
the basis of the primary sequence with the possibility of introducing
additional local conformational propensities, or long-range tertiary
contacts. The ﬂexible-meccano approach was exploited for the ﬁrst
time to study the C—terminal domain of Sendai virus phosphoprotein,
and has been gradually reﬁned, extended and tested on a number of
different experimental systems, including the disordered proteins a-
synuclein, Tan and p53, involved in Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s
diseases and human cancer, respectively. Currently, no alternative
tools exist that can provide ensembles and ensemble-averaged
parameters for user-deﬁned conformational sampling regimes. The

program is interfaced to a ﬁilly interactive and robust graphical
interface as described below.

3 ALGORITHM

3.1 Flexible-meccano ensemble generation

Flexible-meccano uses a highly efﬁcient minimization algorithm
to build multiple, different copies of the same polypeptide chain
by randomly sampling arnino acid-speciﬁc backbone dihedral
angle {q} / 1//} potential wells. The population-weighted amino acid-
speciﬁc potentials are derived from a compilation of non-secondary
structural elements of high-resolution X-ray crystallographic protein
structures. The peptide chain is constructed by using the selected
{q} / 1//} pairs to sequentially connect peptide planes.

The algorithm is based on tools developed for Meccano and
Dynamic Meccano approaches (Bouvignies et al., 2006a, b; Hus
et al., 2001; Hus et al., 2008; Salmon et al., 2009). These algorithms
were used to determine the average orientation of peptide planes,
and their associated dynamics, in folded proteins on the basis of
optimization of parameters deﬁning the orientation of each place on

the basis of NMR residual dipolar couplings (RDCs). The difference
in this case is that, rather than determining the orientation of the
peptide plane on the basis of experimental data, the unique constraint
used to orient each peptide unit is the backbone dihedral angle pair,
that is randomly selected from the database potential for each amino
acid. Each tetrahedral junction is constructed with optimal geometry.

The coordinates of the generic peptide plane were derived from
high-resolution X-ray crystallographic structures (Salmon et (11.,
2009). Amino acid-speciﬁc hard-spheres are used to avoid steric
clashes, to provide an efﬁcient, but physically reasonable model
of repulsive interatomic forces. No attractive forces are explicitly
used. A total of 23 potential energy wells are sampled: one for
each of the 20 different amino acid types, and speciﬁc potentials
accounting for the particular backbone conformational propensities
of residues that precede prolines, prolines that precede prolines,
and glycines that precede prolines. The simplicity of the model
makes the structure ensemble generation highly efﬁcient (100 000
structures of a 100-arnino acid protein can be created in 30 min
on a single processor, although the time increases with the number
of experimental parameters that are simultaneously predicted). The
complete absence of experimental constraints in this sampling phase
avoids distortions due to additional potential energy terms such as
those used in restrained MD calculations. Although this statistical
coil model of the unfolded state has been tested with respect to its
predictive power of diverse experimental parameters (for example
RDCs and chemical shifts, and small angle scattering curves), it is
simple for the user to replace the statistical coil potentials by an
alternative description of the unfolded state.

Additional conformational propensities can be added to inﬂuence
the sampling of the protein in the following ways (Figure 1):

(1) Local conformational propensities can be modiﬁed on
an amino acid-speciﬁc basis to include an additional
potential, centred on a speciﬁc Gaussian shaped region of
backbone dihedral angle space {¢target/1//target}, of width
{A¢target/A1//target}e POPUIated With 3- PropenSity Pres' The
widths of the additional Gaussian shaped potentials and their
propensities can be set by the user, and are simply added to,
or replace, the existing potential.

(2) Conformational propensities of regions of the primary
sequence can be modiﬁed to include the presence of
continuous secondary structure—either a-helical, ﬂ-sheet
or polyproline II, with propensity p550. Propensities can
be introduced in a cooperative, or independent manner,
for example a complete helix can be constructed for 20%
of conformers, (cooperative) or 20% additional helical
sampling can be introduced randomly in the same sequence
(non-cooperative).

(3) Long-range contacts can be included in the conformational
description by specifying that a certain percentage of
structures (pdist), must contain at least one C“ atom from an
amino acid between residues 1' and j, that is closer than dmax
away from a C“ atom in any amino acid between residues k
and 1.

The calculation can be used to generate explicit coordinates of each
conformer in the ensemble, or simply to calculate appropriately
averaged observables that would be expected in the presence of such

a conformational regime (see below). At present the introduction
of folded domains into the ensemble is restricted to the presence
of individual secondary structural elements, or regions that can be
uniquely encoded by their {<11 / 1//} values.

3.2 Application to the prediction of experimental
parameters

After construction of the conformational ensemble, expected
experimental values can be calculated from this ensemble.

3.2.1 Residual dipolar couplings RDCs report on local
conformational sampling of each amino acid in the sequence, and
are exquisitely sensitive to the presence of even weakly populated
secondary structural elements (Jensen and Blackledge, 2008; Jensen
et (11., 2009). The dipolar coupling of a given magnetic moment
with any other magnetic moment in its surroundings is given by
(Blackledge, 2005):

=_ Jays/10h
I" 16713;"?g

 

(P2c0s(els)) (1)

where y is the gyromagnetic ratio for the two spins I and S, rls is the
distance between the spins, [10 is the permeability of free space, and
h is Planck’s constant. In the fast exchange regime, the measured
RDC reports on the arithmetic average over all conformations
sampled up to the millisecond timescale. It has been shown that
averaging of expected RDCs from each conformer in the ensemble
using the expression in Equation (2) gives reasonable reproduction
of the distribution of experimental RDCs measured in IDPs and
denatured proteins. The RDCs from each internuclear vector IS are
calculated from the orientation (6,(p) with respect to the alignment
tensor of each individual conformer (j) with axial and rhombic
components (Ag, Ar) :

= — m [Aa(3cos26 —1)+§A, sin26cos(2(p):| (2)
’5 8712132 2
The alignment tensors are calculated using an in-house routine,
based on previous published algorithms (Berlin et (11 ., 2009,
Zweckstetter and Bax, 2000). The average shown in Equation (1) is
then approximated by the calculation of the mean of the RDCs over

all structures in the ensemble:
DIS = (D1,) (3)

As discussed in previous publications, this average has highly
unfavourable convergence characteristics (Nodet et (11., 2009). As
a rule of thumb, n X 1000 structures are required in the ensemble,
where n is the number of amino acids in the sequence, before
convergence of the RDC of a speciﬁc amino acid has been achieved.

It is possible to alleviate the convergence problem by calculating
the alignment characteristics of uncorrelated ‘local alignment
windows’ (LAWs) (Marsh et (11., 2008), but this approach requires
knowledge of the explicit modulation of the underlying baseline of
the RDC proﬁle. The baseline proﬁle normally exhibits a bell-shaped
distribution of RDCs, however, this proﬁle may be signiﬁcantly
modulated in the presence of persistent long-range contacts between
regions of the chain that are distant in the primary sequence (Nodet
et (11., 2009; Salmon et (11., 2010). When selecting ensembles of
structures in agreement with experimental data, it is useful to average
over a smaller number of structures, and in this case the combination

of LAWs and explicit modulation of the underlying baseline has been
shown to provide a means of combining RDCs and paramagnetic
relaxation enhancements (PREs) for ensemble selection (Salmon
et al., 2010). Here, we concentrate on the prediction of values
of experimental parameters that would be expected under given
conformational sampling regimes, so we have chosen to retain
the explicit global molecular description for all parameters. The
algorithm allows for the deﬁnition of long-range contacts between
different regions of the primary sequence at a given propensity
(vide supra), alone, or in combination with given populations of
secondary structural motifs. This allows the prediction of expected
RDC proﬁles even in the presence of complex levels of local and
long-range structure.

3.2.2 Scalar 3JNHHa couplings Scalar couplings between amide
and alpha protons (3JNHHa ) report on the conformationally averaged
<1) dihedral angle (Pardi et al., 1984; Ludvigsen et al., 1991; Vuister
and Bax, 1993). The following Karplus relationship is used to
calculate the values for each conformer:

3JNHHa (<1)) =Acos2 (<1) — 60°) +Bcos (<1) — 60°) + C (4)

which are then averaged over the ensemble. A, B and C have been
optimized using coupling constants measured in several proteins
of known structure and therefore provide a constraint on the
distribution of <1) angles in conformational ensembles of IDPs
(Mukrasch et al., 2007; Smith et al., 1996).

3.2.3 Paramagnetic relaxation enhancements A coherent picture
of the conformational behaviour of IDPs and partially folded
proteins requires not only a mapping of local structure but also long-
range order. Long-range interactions in IDPs are often transient in
nature and their detection, therefore, requires a strong probe that is
active over a few nanometers such as that provided by an unpaired
electron. One of the most efﬁcient ways of introducing an unpaired
electron is by attaching a thiol reactive methanethiosulfonate
(MTSL) spin label to the protein through a cysteine residue. The
dipolar interaction between the unpaired electron and the protein
nuclei induces PREs that strongly depend on the electron-nucleus
distances. By introducing spin labels at several different positions in
the protein, a mapping of long-range interactions in the disordered
state becomes possible.

The transverse relaxation rate due to the presence of the unpaired
electron can be expressed as follows (Abragam, 1994; Gillespie and
Shortle, 1997):

2
rm = %  ngguﬁse (s, +1) {4J(0)+3J(a)H)} (5)
where ge is the electron g-factor, yH is the gyromagnetic ratio of the
observed nucleus (proton), se is the electron spin quantum number,
(0].; is the proton frequency, [13 is the Bohr magneton and [10 is the
permittivity of free space. PREs can be calculated over structural
ensembles by considering a ﬁxed position of the MTSL side-chain
(for example on the C13 atom of the cysteine) and by invoking the

spectral density function:

1(w>=(r,;ie){l+;—Czrg} (6)

where ‘L'C is the correlation time of the relaxation active interaction.
This simple description does not account for the potentially high

level of ﬂexibility of the spin label itself (the electron spin label
is attached to the molecule via MTSL attached to a cysteine side-
chain). In order to address this, in the ﬂexible-meccano approach,
MTSL conformations are built explicitly for each backbone
conformer by randomly sampling available rotamers and retaining
only conformations that are sterically allowed. 1(a)) can be described
using a model-free expression of the order parameter, comprising
the orientational and distance-dependent components of the internal
motion that both strongly depend on the motion of the spin label
with respect to the observed nuclear spin (Bruschweiler et al., 1992;
Clore and Iwahara, 2009):

where the order parameter S%I_e describes the motion of the dipolar
interaction vector, ‘L'C =TrTS/(‘Er+‘ts) is a ﬁinction of 1's and 1', the
electron spin and rotational correlation times, respectively, and re =
l/(Ti_1+‘lfr_1+‘lfs_1) where 1:,- is the local correlation time of the
spin label. rH_e is the instantaneous distance between the proton and
the electron spins. Order parameters can be expressed in terms of
radial and angular components:

53-. = 5.1.5.2.. (8)
where:
53.. =<r.7_6.>_1 (r312 (9)
 ﬁrmer 
m=_

QmOI describes the orientation of the interaction vector in the frame
of each conformer. The above expressions are used to calculate the
transverse relaxation rate for each backbone conformation produced
with the ﬂexible-meccano algorithm, and the effective relaxation rate
for each amide proton is then averaged over all retained conformers:

1 n

ttl f

 am: an
i=1

PREs are often described in terms of the ratio between the intensity
measured in a standard HSQC experiment in the presence of the
reduced and oxidized forms of the MTSL label:

1 F3“ exp <—I‘§alc Tmix)

—_— (12)
0 d 1
I 1‘36 +F§aC

Here Pam is the intrinsic relaxation rate of the amide proton and 1' mix
is the mixing time during which relaxation occurs in the HSQC pulse
sequence (typically 10 ms).

3.2.4 Chemical shift prediction Chemical shifts are the most
accessible NMR parameter, and provide powerﬁil probes of
conformation, in particular of secondary structural propensity
(Eliezer et al., 2001; Kjaergaard et al., 2011; Marsh et al., 2006;
Modig et al., 2007; Schwarzinger et al., 2001). Remarkable progress
has been made in recent years in the prediction of chemical
shifts from protein conformation (Wishart and Sykes, 1994), and

allowing the user to deﬁne conformational propensities [in this case an Ot-

between positions 5715 and 25730 (bottom)].

vice-versa (Berjanskii et al., 2009; Cavalli et al., 2007; Shen
et al., 2008). We have previously investigated the possibility
of combining ﬂexible-meccano with chemical shift prediction to
analyze experimental chemical shifts in IDPs (Jensen et al., 2010).
While 13Cot, 13C1}, 13C’ and Hot chemical shifts depend strongly on
<1) and 11/, 15 N and IHN chemical shifts show a more or less uniform
dependence on the two dihedral angles. In addition, the 13C01 and
13C1} chemical shifts display an almost inverse dependence on the
<1) / 11/ distribution and therefore report on the populations of a-helix
and ﬂ-sheet in the disordered state. Scripts are provided with the
ﬂexible-meccano program that can be directly interfaced to well-
known chemical shift prediction algorithms such as Sparta (Shen
and Bax, 2007) and ShiftX (Han et al., 2011; Neal et al., 2003).

3.2.5 SAXS prediction Small angle X-ray scattering provides
complementary information about the extent of conformational
sampling of the unfolded protein. Scripts are again provided that
allow the user to interface the ﬂexible-meccano program with
the SAXS program Crysol (Svergun et al., 1995) and calculate
expected SAXS curves that would be associated with the given
ensemble (Bemado and Blackledge, 2010; Bernado and Svergun,
2012; Bemado et al., 2007).

3.2.6 Ramachandran segment division In order to describe the
sampling of conformational space in the different ensembles,
the ﬂexible-meccano program provides a statistical analysis of
the Ramachandran space sampled by the ensemble. In order to
do this, <1),1// space is divided into four quadrants as follows; 01L:
{<1) >0°}, a], : {<1) <0,—120° < 11/ <50°},13P : {—100° <<1) <0°},
11/ >50° or 11/ < —120°}, 13$ : {—180° <<1) < —100°}, 11/ >50° or
1//<—120°}. The population of these quadrants is indicated as
pa in... 11),... and 173.9.

4 IMPLEMENTATION

Examples of the implementation of ﬂexible-meccano are shown in
Figures 2 and 3. The following steps are shown:

(1) Reading of the primary sequence of the protein. This provides
a scrollable table describing the conformational potentials to
be used in the statistical sampling for each <1) / 11/ pair. The
default potentials are those provided by the ﬂexible-meccano
statistical coil library.

Urea (simulation used statistical coil for all residues; Mohana-Borges et al.,
2004), (B) N-terminal disordered transactivation domain of p53 (1793; Wells
et al., 2008), simulation used coil sampling except for residues 22724 which
populate 30% more helix, and 58791, which populate 20% more PPII and
(C) alpha-synuclein. Simulation used coil sampling except for the presence
of a long range contact between residues 1710 and 1307140.

(2) It is possible to modify the potentials by adding additional
propensities. In the example shown in Figure 2 the strand
from residue 12—18 populates an a-helix for 50% of the
conformers. The remaining conformers follow the amino
acid-speciﬁc potentials. It is also possible to introduce
speciﬁc sampling for each amino acid, focusing on speciﬁc
regions of Ramachandran space. All modiﬁcations can be
introduced ‘by-hand’ in the input ﬁle containing the sequence
information, or via the graphical interface.

(3) Long-range contacts between different regions of the primary
sequence are also speciﬁed using the graphical interface,
where the range of amino acids involved in the contact, and the
maximum distance between any residues in the two ranges,
are introduced.

(4) The user can choose between the following output options:
the number of structures in the ensemble to be calculated,
whether or not explicit structural coordinates should be written
for each conformer in the ensemble, and which data types
(RDCs, PREs, J-couplings etc.) should be predicted from
the ensemble. In the case of RDC prediction, the user can
select the RDCs to be calculated, whereas for PRE prediction
the position of the cysteine mutants must be speciﬁed,
the magnetic ﬁeld strength and the intrinsic (diarnagnetic)
linewidth in the proton dimension.

(5) The ensemble calculation and data prediction algorithm runs
entirely as a background calculation, so that the user can either
run numerous calculations from the same interface, or analyze
the results of one calculation while running another. All results
are robustly classiﬁed in terms of date and time of initialization
of each calculation.

(6) Data output is provided in text format, and in graphical
form (postscript). In addition to the speciﬁed data types, the
program also provides a distribution of the radius of gyration
over the ensemble.

(7) Robust scripts are provided that interface the resulting
coordinate ﬁles with protocols for calculating ensemble
averaged chemical shifts and small angle scattering curves.

Examples of RDCs calculated using ﬂexible-meccano in comparison
to experimental values from apomyoglobin (Mohana-Borges et al.,
2004), alpha-synuclein (Bemado et al., 2005a) and p53 (Wells et al.,
2008) are shown in Figure 4 along with the conformational sampling
regime used to reproduce the data.

5 DISCUSSION

The classical structure ﬁinction paradigm that has successfully
underpinned our understanding of molecular biology breaks down
when considering proteins that have no stable tertiary structure
in their ﬁinctional form. The determination of a 3D structure
can provide only a single snapshot of such a highly ﬂexible
system, and alternative methods are essential to study the behaviour
of these disordered proteins (Fisher and Stultz, 2011; Marsh
et al., 2010; Mittag et al., 2010; Tompa, 2011). One promising
approach is to describe the protein in terms of an equilibrium of
rapidly inter-converting conformers. Currently, tools to generate
such ensemble descriptions are rare, and poorly adapted to the
prediction of experimental data. In this article, we present an
algorithm that generates ensembles of molecules, on the basis
of amino acid-speciﬁc conformational potentials and volume
exclusion. Conformational sampling depends uniquely on the
primary sequence, with the possibility of introducing additional
local or long-range conformational propensities. We show how the
algorithm can be used to calculate expected values of experimental
NMR parameters measured at atomic or molecular resolution, for a
broad range of user-deﬁned conformational sampling regimes.

We envisage three generic levels of interest: (i) Researchers who
have measured experimental data from a particular IDP of interest
and are motivated to compare their data with those expected from
a fully disordered protein with this speciﬁc primary sequence. No
such tool exists at this time. (ii) Researchers who see evidence
of deviation from ‘random coil’ behaviour in their protein, and
who would like to determine whether these data are in agreement
with a particular conformational sampling regime (e.g. a particular
propensity of helical sampling in a given region of the chain, or the
presence of weak long-range contacts between parts of the chain that
are distant in primary sequence; Nodet et al., 2009; Salmon et al.,
2010; Schneider et al., 2012). (iii) Researchers who are interested
in working with a broad ensemble of conformers representing
the ﬂexibility of the IDP of interest, either to use ‘sarnple and
select’ approaches to develop a sub-ensemble in agreement with
experimental data, or to seed molecular dynamics or restrained

ensemble molecular dynamics simulations of their protein. We add
a ﬁnal note of caution: any analysis that involves detailed inspection
of the structure of speciﬁc conformers must of course be performed
in the knowledge that no ensemble of highly disordered proteins
can ever be considered to be unique. Agreement with experiment
only conﬁrms that a given ensemble does not violate a speciﬁc
data type, which itself is only sensitive to particular aspects of the
conformational sampling.

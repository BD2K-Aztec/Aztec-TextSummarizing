ABSTRACT

Motivation: Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChlP) followed by
high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) measures the genome-
wide occupancy of transcription factors in vivo. Different combin-
ations of DNA-binding protein occupancies may result in a gene
being expressed in different tissues or at different developmental
stages. To fully understand the functions of genes, it is essential
to develop probabilistic models on multiple ChIP-Seq profiles
to decipher the combinatorial regulatory mechanisms by multiple
transcription factors.

Results: In this work, we describe a probabilistic model (SignalSpider)
to decipher the combinatorial binding events of multiple transcription
factors. Comparing with similar existing methods, we found
SignalSpider performs better in clustering promoter and enhancer
regions. Notably, SignalSpider can learn higher-order combinatorial
patterns from multiple ChIP-Seq profiles. We have applied
SignalSpider on the normalized ChIP-Seq profiles from the ENCODE
consortium and learned model instances. We observed different
higher-order enrichment and depletion patterns across sets of
proteins. Those clustering patterns are supported by Gene Ontology
(GO) enrichment, evolutionary conservation and chromatin interaction
enrichment, offering biological insights for further focused studies.
We also proposed a specific enrichment map visualization method
to reveal the genome-wide transcription factor combinatorial patterns
from the models built, which extend our existing fine-scale knowledge
on gene regulation to a genome-wide level.

1 INTRODUCTION

In human and other eukaryotes, gene expression is regulated by
the binding of various modulatory transcription factors (TF)
onto cis-regulatory DNA elements near genes. Binding of differ-
ent combinations of TFs may result in a gene being expressed in

different tissues or at different developmental stages. To fully
understand a gene’s function in the cell, it is essential to identify
the TFs that regulate the gene and their corresponding TF bind-
ing sites (TFBS) (Wong et al., 2013). The techniques such as
protein binding microarray (Berger et al., 2006), microﬂuidjc
afﬁnity analysis (Fordyce et al., 2010) and protein microarray
assays (H0 et al., 2006; Hu et al., 2009) enable us to measure the
DNA sequence binding of TFs in vitro. On the other hand, the
technology of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed
by microarray (ChIP-ChIP) or sequencing (ChIP-Seq) (Johnson
et al., 2007; Ren et al., 2000) can efﬁciently measure the binding
occupancy of a particular TF on a genome-wide scale in vivo. In
a typical ChIP-Seq study, the ﬁrst step is to call the peaks, i.e.
determining the precise location in the genome where the TF
binds. A number of peak calling tools have been developed,
but recent benchmark studies have shown that the peaks from
those tools are often inconsistent (Laajala et al., 2009; Wilbanks
and Facciotti, 2010).

Because multiple transcription factors often work in cis regu-
latory modules to confer complex gene regulatory programs, it is
necessary to develop models on multiple ChIP-Seq datasets to
decipher the combinatorial DNA-binding mechanism. In the fol-
lowing, we brieﬂy review some of the previous works in this area.
Gerstein et a]. used pair-wise peak overlapping patterns to con-
struct a human regulatory network (Gerstein et al., 2012). Xie

enriched regions with known motifs for a given DNA-binding

2011). On the other hand, Ji et a]. proposed a differential prin-
cipal component analysis method on ChIP-Seq to perform un-
supervised pattern discovery and statistical inference to identify
differential proteiniDNA interactions between two biological
conditions (Ji et al., 2013). Guo et al. described a generative
probabilistic model (GEM) for high resolution DNA binding
site discovery from ChIP data (Guo et al., 2012). Interestingly,
that model combines ChIP signals and DNA motif discovery
together to achieve precise predictions of the DNA binding 10-
cations of a DNA-binding protein. The authors have further
demonstrated how GEM can be applied to reveal spatially con-
strained transcription factor binding site pairs on a genome.

Despite the success of the methods described above, to fully
understand a gene’s function, it is essential to develop probabilis-
tic models on multiple ChIP-Seq proﬁles to decipher the genome-
wide combinatorial patterns of DNA-binding protein occupancy.
Unfortunately, the majority of the previous work usually focused
on large-scale clustering of called peaks, which is an intuitive and
straightforward approach. However such approaches have two
limitations, as (i) peak-calling ignores the contributions from
weak bindings of TFs, and (ii) pair-wise analysis ignores the com-
plex combinatorial binding pattern among the TFs. Here we pro-
pose a new approach to build fine-scale probabilistic models for
directly analyzing multiple normalized ChIP-Seq signal proﬁles
on all the promoter and enhancer regions quantitatively so that
weak bindings can be taken into account (Cheng et al., 2012).
Especially, its computational complexity has been carefully de-
signed to scale well with the increasing ChIP-Seq data (i.e. linear
complexity). After model training, we can extract and reveal the
high-order combinatorial and quantitative occurrence patterns
from the trained probabilistic models for better understandings
on the DNA-binding protein combinatorics.

2 METHODS
2.1 Overall approach

We propose and describe a probabilistic three-layered model called
SignalSpider to model the binding mechanisms of DNA-binding proteins
across different genomic regions as depicted in Figure 1. Because it is
generally believed that a genome can be clustered into different types of
regions (Ernst and Kellis, 2012), we have put a clustering layer to cluster
the genome regions into different types at the top ({x’}). After the clus-
tering, we model that different DNA-binding proteins can be found on
each type of region. Thus, we put a binding mode layer in the middle to
represent the binding modes of each DNA-binding protein ({b;}). For
example, if bj’.=l (or 0), it means the j-th protein binds (or does not
bind) to the t-th region. In particular, we note that bj’. can have more
than two binding modes here (e.g. bj’. e {0, l, 2}) to account for partial
binding modes (Lickwar et al., 2012). Based on each binding mode of
each DNA-binding protein at the middle layer ({b;}), we assume a
Gaussian distribution for its observed ChIP-Seq proﬁle signal ({sj’.})
at the bottom layer. We note that such a hierarchical structure is well-
justiﬁed in most gene regulation contexts. For example, its hierarchy is
similar to those of iASeq (Wei et al., 2012) and CorMotif (Wei and Ji,
2014) but in different contexts. SignalSpider aims at modeling and ex-
tracting genome-wide combinatorial patterns from the normalized ChIP-
Seq proﬁle signals of DNA-binding proteins; iASeq aims at inferring
allele-speciﬁcity probabilities of proteiniDNA binding sites from
ChIP-Seq read counts; CorMotif aims at modeling the t-statistics of
genes’ differential expression.

2.2 Model description

Mathematically, SignalSpider is a mixture model with a three-layer hier-
archy as depicted in Figure l. The main function of SignalSpider is to
extract patterns from multiple signal proﬁles by estimating the combina-
torial interaction between the top layer cluster and the middle layer signal
components. For tth region, the bottom layer is to represent the observed
signals {.s’1,s’2, . . . ,sjw} across M proﬁles directly. We empirically observe
that the normalized ENCODE ChIP-Seq proﬁle signals (after taking nat-
ural logarithm) always follow continuous Gaussian mixture distributions.
Thus, we model each proﬁle to follow the generation of one dimensional
Gaussian mixture distribution with N components, where the hidden
discrete variable b’. represents the component that is used to generate
signal s’.. The top layer is the cluster layer consisting of K clusters.
Each cluster inﬂuences the middle layer components used for generating
signals via a discrete function or. The hidden discrete variable x’ represents
which cluster is used. Mathematically, a SignalSpider Model can be
deﬁned as 955 = (iﬂil, {06:37:}, {(Mjk, 01k)»:

955 = (iﬂil, {06:37:}, {(Mjk, Ujk)»
Vie {1,2,...,K},Vje {1,2,...,M},Vke {1,2,...,N}

where 21,-: P(x’ = i) is the prior probability of top layer ith cluster. 05,-];( =
P(bj’. = klx’ = i) is the conditional probability of the kth middle layer com-
ponent, given that the current top layer cluster is the ith one, for the jth
signal proﬁle. (Ml-k, 0,7,) are the Gaussian mean and variance of the jth
signal proﬁle, given that its middle layer component is the kth one. In

essence, it is a Bayesian network in which complete data likelihood can be

ChIP-Seq Pruﬁle

Fig. 1. Factor graph representations of SignalSpider in plate notation. Brieﬂy, circles are variables and squares are functions. White and grey circles

denote hidden and observed variables respectively

Brieﬂy, all the model parameters ({rri}, {org-k}, {(ujk, ajk)}) are randomly
initialized at the beginning. E-step and M-step are then alternated and
repeated until the percentage of changes in the model parameters is nu-
merically negligible (i.e. < 0.001%). Multiple runs are used to avoid local
optima.

2.4 Complexity analysis

The prior probability of top layer ith cluster {21,-} is 0(K). The condi-
tional probability of the jth signal proﬁle being in its kth middle layer
component, given that the current top layer cluster is the ith one {org-k},
is 0(KMN). The Gaussian mean and variance of the kth middle layer
component for the jth signal proﬁle {(pv-k, ajk)} is 0(MN). Limited by
the parameters between top layer and middle layer (i.e. {org-1c D, the over-
all model complexity is 0(KMN).

On the other hand, the overall time complexity of each iteration
of the expectation maximization method is 0(KMN T) because it is lim-
ited by computing the posterior probabilities of hidden variables
{p(x’ =i,bj’.=k|D, 6)} in the E-step, although we can pre-compute all
the numerators before summing them up to obtain the denominators
for speedup. In other words, its model complexity and building time
complexity are both linear to the input data size. It can scale well with
the increasing ChIP-Seq datasets.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Data sources

The primary data sources are the normalized ChIP-Seq signal
proﬁles processed from the ENCODE consortium (ENCODE,
2012). They have been normalized by replicate aggregation and
kernel smoothing by Wiggler (Hoffman et al., 2013). In particu-
lar, we have downloaded all the available normalized ChIP-Seq
signal profiles in the K562 cell line. For illustrative purpose,
some of the ChIP-Seq normalized signal profiles for E2F4,
CFOS, GATA2, J UNB and TBP are plotted in Supplementary
Figure S1. From the ﬁgure, we can observe that the signal mag-
nitude and variation are quite different among the proﬁles. It is
challenging to extract any combinatorial pattern of the signal
proﬁles by naive methods.

In particular, we limit our study to the human genome (hgl9)
regions designated as ‘Promoter’ or ‘Enhancer’ regions by both
ChromHMM and Segway at 1000 base pairs resolution
(Hoffman et al., 2012). Maximal normalized ChIP-Seq signals
are taken at those regions; natural logarithm has also been taken
for efficient Gaussian modeling.

3.2 Tests on simulated ChIP-Seq proﬁles

3.2.] Performance comparison To verify the robustness of
SignalSpider, we seek to compare it with ChromHMM (Ernst
and Kellis, 2012) and jMOSAiCS (Zeng et al., 2013) on their
genome clustering abilities in different parameter settings. We
would like to note that, in addition to its ability to cluster
genome regions, SignalSipider can also extract higher-order
binding patterns among the DNA-binding proteins of interests
from their ChIP-Seq data. Such ability is useful for interpreting
the combinatorial transcription factor binding patterns encoded
in multiple ENCODE ChIP-Seq data. It will be shown in the
following section.

We have generated simulated data based on ENCODE ChIP-
Seq data properties. In particular, the number of data (I) was set
to the same size as in the following section (i.e. T = 92, 485); the
number of clusters (K) was selected from {2,3,..., 10}; the
number of profiles (Ill) was selected from {3, 4, 5, 10} to reﬂect
the usual clique sizes in the following section; the number of
ChIP-Seq signal components of each DNA-binding protein (N)
was set to 2 to accommodate the binary clustering nature of
ChromHMM and jMOSAiCS (although SignalSpider can
handle 3 or more in this aspect). For the means and variance
of each simulated proﬁle, we randomly paired it with an actual
profile in the ENCODE ChIP-Seq data. For the actual proﬁle
paired, we ﬁtted a one dimensional Gaussian mixture model on it
with N components in 10 replicates because we observed
Gaussian mixtures fit well to the actual ChIP-Seq normalized
profile data after taking natural logarithm. The ﬁtted model
with the highest likelihood was then used as the basis for the
simulated profile paired. By doing all the above, we obtained

simulated datasets with known cluster labels in different param-
eter settings.

For each parameter setting, we generated 10 datasets. For
each dataset, we ran SignalSpider, ChromHMM and
jMOSAiCS on it with the corresponding parameter setting.
Ten random runs with random initialization were used for
SignalSpider and ChromHMM for each dataset. The run with
the highest likelihood was taken as the ﬁnal model for both
SignalSpider and ChromHMM on each dataset. The conver-
gence graphs are shown in the Supplementary Data. In sum-
mary, it can be observed that SignalSpider converges within 20
iterations for most cases. For example, the convergence graph for
the 10 runs with the setting K = 10 and M = 10 is depicted in
Supplementary Figure S2.

For each dataset, we evaluate the clustering ability of each
method based on two metrics: Rand Statistics (RS) (Halkidi
et al., 2001) and Purity (Zhao and Karypis, 2002). Rand
Statistics is based on the intra—cluster similarity and inter-cluster
dissimilarity. For the intra—cluster similarity, if a pair of data
vectors is in the same cluster in both the target result and the
clustering result, then the score will be increased by one. For the
inter-cluster dissimilarity, if a pair of vectors is in different clus-
ters in both the target result and the clustering result, then the
score will also be increased by one. On the contrary, if a pair of
data vectors is in the same cluster in the target result, but not in
the clustering result, the score will not be increased. After we
have checked all the possible pairs, the score is normalized by
the total number of possible pairs. On the other hand, purity
solely measures the intra-cluster similarity. Nevertheless, it is
useful in the sense that we only care about the quality of indi-
vidual clusters. Their mathematical deﬁnitions can be found in
Supplementary Data. The results are depicted in Figure 2. It can
be observed that SignalSpider has a better performance than
ChromHMM and jMOSAiCS on the given datasets. We
reason that it is because ChromHMM and jMOSAiCS involve
peak-calling, ignoring the weak DNA-binding events.

3.2.2 Sensitivity analysis on cluster prior probabilities It has
been reported that weak clusters may be absorbed into strong

clusters during a clustering process (Wei and J i, 2014). To exam-
ine its effect, we have conducted a sensitivity analysis on cluster
prior probabilities under two simulations (Scenario 1 and 2; de-
tails can be found in Supplementary Data). Brieﬂy, for each
simulation, we examine how often a weak cluster (with low
prior cluster probability) can be discovered in the presence of
another weak cluster and a strong cluster (with high prior cluster
probability) in 100 random runs. From the simulations, it can be
observed that weak clusters are more difﬁcult to be discovered
than strong clusters because weak clusters tend to be merged into
a discovered strong cluster. Nonetheless, from the results, we can
observe that such phenomenon is not severe (e. g. > 70% discov-
ery rate for clusters with 0.2 prior probabilities or higher).
Multiple runs of SignalSpider with different initializations can
be adopted to circumvent such problems.

3.3 Complex pattern discovery

To demonstrate the higher-order (beyond pair-wise) pattern dis-
covery of SignalSpider, the available proteineprotein pair-wise
interaction data is used as the basis so that we don’t have to
enumerate all the possible sets which are computationally
infeasible.

3.3.] Data acquisition For the DNA-binding proteins we have
identiﬁed from the ENCODE ChIP-Seq data, we mapped them
onto the BioGRID proteineprotein interaction database (Chatr—
Aryamontri et al., 2013). Based on the network mapped, we ex-
tract the maximal cliques with k = 3 (Palla et al., 2005). Note
that maximal cliques are deﬁned as the cliques with at least three
nodes which subgraphs are also cliques. By choosing k = 3, we
ensure that the output cliques have at least three nodes for dis-
covering higher-order combinatorial patterns on at least three
proﬁles (beyond pair-wise patterns on two proﬁles which have
already been given from BioGRID). The clique list is shown
Supplementary Table S1.

3.3.2 Model building For each clique, we trained SignalSpider
on the ChIP-Seq signal proﬁles of the corresponding DNA bind-
ing proteins belonging to the clique. In the parameter settings,

Fig. 3. Examples of clustering performed by SignalSpider. In all the panels, the horizontal axis represents the bins {1, 2, . . . , T}. For panels (a) and (c),
the grey scheme represents ChIP-Seq signal values while the colour scheme indicates the cluster index x’. For panels (b) and (d), the vertical height
represents each cluster probability while the colour scheme indicates the cluster index x’. The clustering probabilities P(x’) are calculated by computing
belief propagation (sum product algorithm) from the leaves to the root of the graph topology which is outlined in Figure l. The horizontal region order
(from left to right) of the panels is sorted by the ascending cluster index i which is determined by arg max,- P(x’ = i) for all bins (i.e. V t e {1, 2, . . . , T})

the number of (top layer) clusters (K) was varied from 2 to 10;
number of (middle layer) ChIP-Seq signal components of each
DNA-binding protein (N) was varied from 2 to 3; 10 replicate
runs were used for each parameter setting. The SignalSpider
model with the highest marginal data likelihood was then
taken as the representative model for each clique. Note that
the SignalSpider model has equality constraints for regulariza-
tion (more details can be found in the Supplementary Data). To
verify its modeling, we can marginalize and compute individual
(middle layer) ChIP-Seq signal component occurring probability
using 13(1),. =k) = 3:, 13(1),. =k|x = i)P(x = i) = z: 1 ail-kn,- and
plot its marginalized Gaussian mixture distribution, some of
which are depicted in Supplementary Figure S4. From the
ﬁgure, we can observe that SignalSpider can model the signal
distributions precisely. Another practical aspect of SignalSpider
is its soft clustering ability. We can verify its modeling by looking
at the top layer cluster probabilities P(x’) as shown in Figure 3.
From the figure, we can observe that the profiles are well clus-
tered by SignalSpider into different combinations according to
their signal values.

3.3.3 Higher-order combinatorial pattern discovery In particu-
lar, we are interested in the patterns enriched in each clique
model. Thus, we calculated the fold enrichment for each ChIP-
Seq signal component in each cluster P(bj=k|x=i), comparing
to its own marginal occurring probability P(bj=k).
Mathematically, it is calculated as:

 _ Clijk
13(1),. = k)P(x = i) Z: 1 gym

where F OLDij-k is the fold enrichment value for the kth ChIP-Seq
signal component of the jth DNA-binding protein in the ith clus-
ter. To Visualize all the clique models, we have plotted the en-
richment maps with full discussions in Supplementary Data.
Representative examples are discussed and depicted in Figure 4.

For Clique l, we observe the prominent co-occurrence of
CJUN, GTF2FB, P300 and TBP in 14% of genomic ChIP-Seq
signal regions. These proteins are known to be part of the pre-
initiation complex (PIC) for initiating gene transcription as
shown in Figure 8 of Martens et al. (2003). On the other hand,
GTF2B and TBP are further found to be co-associative in an-
other 25% genomic regions, which provides genome-wide

evidence on their direct binding as revealed by a recent PIC
crystal structure study (Murakami et al., 2013). For Clique 11,
we can observe there is a strong enriched co—occurrence pattern
between SIN3A, SP1 and CEBPB. It has been shown in a pre-
vious study that SIN3A forms complexes with p53 and HDACl
to repress the ERalpha promoter on which SP1 and the CCAAT
binding site bound by CEBPB are found. Our model provides
additional genome-wide evidence for such interactions (De
Amicis et al., 2011). For Clique 13, we observe the same PIC
pattern as in clique l. Notably, Clique 13 reveals more details in
the formation of PIC than clique 1. For instance, TAFl and TBP
show a strong co-association pattern because both of them are
part of Transcription factor II D (TFIID). On the other hand,
GTF2F1 is part of Transcription factor II F (TFIIF). TFIID and
TFIIF are known to form the RNA polymerase II preinitiation
complex with other transcription factors (including CJUN) to
initialize gene transcription, inducing the co-occurrence pattern
observed by our model (Ruppert and Tjian, 1995). For Clique
18, we observe that TBP shows enriched occurrence in 22% of
ChIP-Seq signal regions. It is consistent with the estimate that
around 24% of human genes contain a TATA box within the
core promoter Wang et al., 2007). Among those, as suggested by
the co-occurrence pattern, half of them are associated with the
activating protein-l (AP-1) which is composed of FOSLl and
activated by BCL3 (Na et al., 1999). For Clique 28, we observe
different pair-wise co-occurrence patterns of SRF, BRGl and
CEBPB. It is expected since each pair of them is shown to
work in different tissues. For instance, SRF and BRGl are
shown in complex to regulate muscle-speciﬁc gene expression
(Zhang et al., 2007); BRGl and CEBPB are shown to interact
for regulating the beta— and gamma-casein promoters 0(u et al.,
2007); SRF and CEBPB are demonstrated to regulate the serum
response element (Hanlon and Sealy, 1999). For Clique 29, we
observe that P300 co-occurs with USFl and USF2. In the former
study by Huang et al., it was shown that the USF family can
recruit histone modiﬁcation complexes including P300 for main-
taining chromatin barriers (Huang et al., 2007). Taken it together
with our results, it suggests that such process may be prevalent
across the genome. For Clique 30, we observe that YYl, P300
and JUNB co-occur in 31% of ChIP-Seq regions. Independent
of this study, Wang et al. have proposed a model explaining their
co-occurrence (Wang et al., 2007). In that model, YYl binds to
the promoter region of the gene HLJl while AP—l (which is

Fig. 4. Fold enrichment maps for the SignalSpider models we have learnt for different cliques. Each clique is composed of multiple DNA-binding
proteins, each of which has its own normalized ChIP-Seq signal proﬁle. For each ﬁgure, the bottom horizontal axis denotes different prior clusters, while
the vertical axis denotes different ChIP-Seq signal components for each DNA-binding protein. The top axis denotes the P-values of the cluster patterns.
The cluster patterns with P 5 0.05 are highlighted in green rectangles (see Supplementary Data for the P-value calculation method). The red and black
colour scheme indicates different levels of fold enrichment for each ChIP-Seq signal component across different prior clusters

composed of JUNB) binds to the enhancer region of the same
gene. P300 is used to mediate the interaction between W1 and
AP-l through DNA bending or looping mechanisms. Such a
local mechanism supports the biological validity of our results.
On the other hand, our results provide genome-wide evidences
on them. For Clique 34, we observe that JUNB is more enriched
with P300 than CEBPB. It is interesting because P300 and
CEBPB have similar structures and functions as gene activators
Via acetylating histones and recruiting other transcription factors
(Liu et al., 2008). Taken together with our results, it suggests that
P300 is preferred more by JUNB to interact than CEBPB
although P300 and CEBPB are functionally similar on a
genome-wide basis.

3.3.4 Comparison with jMOSAiCS We have run jMOSAiCS
(Zeng et al., 2013) (with its default setting) on the same clique
datasets. The enrichment patterns discovered by jMOSAiCS are
depicted in Supplementary Figures S7 and S8. In general, we
observe that the patterns discovered by SignalSpider are largely
consistent with those discovered by jMOSAiCS. However, the
patterns discovered by SignalSpider are more informative than
those by jMOSAiCS according to the enrichment analysis be-
cause SignalSpider can consider the ChIP-Seq signal contribu-
tions from weak bindings of TFs. For instance, the weak
bindings of the P300 protein can be quantitatively revealed by
SignalSpider as depicted in Supplementary Figures S7 and S8. In
addition, SignalSpider can learn the depletion patterns which
most existing methods are difﬁcult to capture.

3.3.5 Gene ontology enrichment analysis For each cluster in
each clique, we ran Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis
using Fisher’s test. For each promoter or enhancer region, we
take the gene within 1000 bp downstream as the target gene.

Different statistical signiﬁcant GO terms (Biological Process)
are found for each cluster (Supplementary Data). For example,
for Clique l, we observed that the GO term ‘cellular response to
external stimulus’ (GO:0071496) is statistically enriched
(P = 0.00028) for the cluster 3 regions (with enrichment of
CJUN) but not in cluster 2 regions (without enrichment
of CJUN). It is consistent with the known functional role
of CJUN which binds with CFOS to form the AP—l early re-
sponse transcription factor (Hess et al., 2004). More examples
can be found in Supplementary Data.

3.3.6 Evolutionary conservation enrichment analysis For each
cluster in each clique, we checked their conservation
using PhastCons with other 99 vertebrate genomes

(phastConleOway) (Siepel et al., 2005). For each cluster, we
computed the mean of the PhastCons scores across its regions.
Interestingly, we can observe that, if a cluster involves enriched
co-occurrence of at least three proteins (active cluster regions), it
is usually more conserved than the background (i.e. all the re-
gions we have considered in this study). Their statistical signiﬁ-
cances (P—Values) are justiﬁed by both Wilcoxon rank sum test
and t—test (P<0.0001). Examples are depicted in Figure 5.
Complete results can be found in Supplementary Data.

3.3.7 Chromatin interaction enrichment analysis We next inves-
tigated whether the regions in each clique are more likely to form
three-dimensional chromatin interactions inside the K562 cell
nuclei. We downloaded and extracted the K562 high-conﬁdence
Hi-C interaction data from Fit-Hi-C (Ay et al., 2014). To accom-
modate the Hi-C data resolution, each interaction region mid-
point is extended to 50 000 bp in both directions. We set a q-
Value threshold to 0.05, resulting in 37 893 very high-conﬁdence
chromatin interactions (shown in Supplementary Data) among

the 92485 regions we have considered (4276691370 possible
interactions). After that, for each possible interaction pair in
each cluster, we check whether it belongs to those 37893 very
high-conﬁdence chromatin interactions. Interestingly, we found
that those active clusters in the last paragraph are also enriched
in Hi-C interaction pairs. For instance, all the clusters shown in
Figure 5 are enriched for Hi-C chromatin interactions using
Fisher exact test (P< 0.0001). Details can be found in
Supplementary Data.

3.4 Revealing DNA-binding protein machineries

Because SignalSpider is linear in complexity, we have built a
SignalSpider model on all the ChIP-Seq proﬁles studied here
using 100 cluster indices with 2 binding modes. The cluster cen-
troids are depicted in Supplementary Figure S9. We observe that
SignalSpider can reveal different DNA-binding protein machi-
neries across different regions. For example, we observe that the
chromatin structure protein proﬁles (e.g. CTCF) are well-sepa-
rated from the other clusters, and thus consistent with their in-
sulator roles.

4 DISCUSSION

With the prevalence of ChIP-Seq technology, massive ChIP-
Seq data have been accumulated. The current ChIP-Seq data
analysis studies usually involve single proﬁle peak calling. Two
areas of improvement are currently being explored in the field:
how to integrate binding proﬁles of multiple transcription fac-
tors and how to include the signals from the areas that are not
called as peaks. In light of that, we have developed a prob-
abilistic model to analyse multiple ChIP-Seq signal profiles
directly. The model (SignalSpider) not only can cluster
genome into several region types, but also can extract subtle
binding combinations from multiple DNA-binding proteins.
The results show that the proposed model demonstrated per-
formance better than the other existing methods on the simu-
lated data derived from the available ChIP-Seq dataset. With
the support of GO enrichment analysis, evolutionary conserva-
tion, chromatin interaction enrichment analysis and available
wet-lab studies, we found that the discovered patterns show
significant genome-wide insights. In particular, the patterns in-
dicate that the genome-wide DNA-binding protein occurrence

patterns are far from simple co-associative pair-wise inter-
actions. Instead, we observed different higher-order enrichment
and depletion patterns across different proteins. With increas-
ing available ChIP-Seq data, we envision that SignalSpider will
be useful in understanding the genome-wide DNA-binding
dynamics.

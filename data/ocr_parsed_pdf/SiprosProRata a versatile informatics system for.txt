processing units (CPUs) on desktops and compute nodes of a
supercomputer. Tens of thousands of MS/MS scans are loaded
to the shared memory and compared with indexed candidate
peptides by multiple threads concurrently. Extensive code opti—
mization achieved a 2—fold speedup from the previous version by
eliminating redundant computation and maximizing shared
memory efﬁciency. Sipros 3.0 can ﬁnish database searching of
a typical 24—hour low—resolution MS/MS dataset of a bacterial
proteome in ~10 minutes on a quad—core desktop with 4 GB of
memory. When running on a supercomputer, MPI was used to
distribute many processes across compute nodes. Each process
was responsible for a subset of MS/MS scans and protein se—
quences. Load balancing was performed dynamically at both the
OpenMP level and MP1 level. Supplementary Figure S2 shows a
near—linear scalability of Sipros on a top open—science supercom—
puter, Titan, up to 24 000 CPU cores on 1500 compute nodes.

As the majority of published metaproteomics studies used
Sequest (Eng et al., 1994) for database searching, the performance
of Sipros was compared with Sequest for peptide identiﬁcation.
In a benchmark 2—hour Pseudomonas putida proteome dataset
with low—resolution MS/MS, Sipros identiﬁed ~10% more pep—
tides than Sequest (5744 peptides by Sipros and 5154 peptides by
Sequest). The peptide level FDR was controlled at 1% for both
programs. To demonstrate its capability for broad—range PTM
searches, Sipros was used to search a 22—hour metaproteome run
of the acid mine drainage (AMD) community with high—reso—
lution MS/MS. Sipros considered 34 PTMs (Supplementary
Table S1) for 57 370 target protein sequences in the database.
The search was completed in ~1 hour using 24 000 CPU cores
on Titan. In total, 38 374 peptides were identified at 1% peptide
FDR, which produced 3597 protein identiﬁcations with at least
two peptides and a unique peptide (Supplementary Table S2). As
a PTM on a position of a protein sequence can be identiﬁed by
multiple peptides, peptides were mapped onto protein sequences
and PTMs were tabulated by protein positions (Supplementary
Table S3). A total of 9761 position—specific PTMs were identiﬁed
in the AMD community. Many of these modiﬁcations stemmed
from proteome sample preparation.

4 QUANTIFICATION BY PRORATA

ProRata was originally developed for metabolic labeling—based
quantitative proteomics (Pan et al., 2006) using identiﬁcation
results from Sequest/DTASelect. Here we integrated ProRata
with Sipros and upgraded ProRata for label—free quantification
and isobaric chemical labeling quantiﬁcation. The label—free
quantiﬁcation was based on spectral counting. Spectral counts
of proteins were normalized and compared between different
samples using exact Poisson tests or Student’s t—tests.
Significantly changed proteins can be identiﬁed based on
P—values with multiple comparison correction and spectral
count differences. The FDR of detecting signiﬁcantly changed
proteins can be estimated with a permutation test, in which rep—
licates are randomly shufﬂed among different conditions to esti—
mate the number of false—positive hits.

ProRata 3.0 also performs label—free quantiﬁcation based on
the peak height of identiﬁed peptides in their selected ion chro—
matograms. Supplementary Table S4 lists the quantiﬁcation re—
sults based on the identiﬁcation results in Supplementary Table

S2. This was used to estimate the relative abundance of a mod—
iﬁed version of a peptide compared with its unmodified version
based on the total peak height of their chromatography peaks
(Supplementary Table S3).

In isobaric chemical labeling analysis, TMT— or iTRAQ—
labeled peptides were quantiﬁed by normalized intensities of re—
porter ions with isotopic impurity correction. Relative abun—
dances of proteins in different samples were estimated by
summing up their peptide abundances. Supplementary Table
S5 shows the iTRAQ analysis result from an AMD benchmark
run at the expected abundance ratio of 4:1 for all proteins. The
measured abundance ratios of proteins were close to the expected
value of4 (quartiles: Q1 2 3.9, Q2 2 4.0, Q3 2 4.2). In a biological
comparison, signiﬁcantly changed proteins can be detected by
fold changes and P—values estimated with the rank product test
(Breitling et al., 2004). FDR of protein quantiﬁcation can be
similarly estimated with a permutation test.

5 DISCUSSION

Sipros/ProRata provides a number of advantages in comparison
with many existing proteomics packages. First, Sipros can per—
form large—scale database searching with hybrid parallelism. Its
scalability allows searches against large metagenomic databases
and searches for a large number of PTMs. Second, ProRata can
be applied to all common quantiﬁcation methods used in com—
munity proteomics, including spectral counting, metabolic
labeling and isobaric chemical labeling. Third, the integration
of Sipros/ProRata provides a comprehensive and ﬂexible inforrn—
atics system that can accomplish identification and quantiﬁca—
tion of proteins, PTMs, mutations and stable isotope probing.

A set test for genetic markers that handles confounders

 

single—SNP test GWAS setting (Kang et al., 2010; Lippert et al.,
2011; Listgarten et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2006). Finally, our ap—
proach allows one to condition on other causal SNPs, by way of
the similarity matrix, for increased power, again, as has been
done in single—SNP test setting (Atwell et al., 2010; Listgarten
et al., 2012; Segura et al., 2012).

The use of LMMs to correct for confounders in GWAS is now
widely accepted because this approach has been shown capable
of correcting for several forms of genetic relatedness such as
population structure and family relatedness (Astle and Balding,
2009; Kang et al., 2010; Price et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2006).
Independently, the use of LMMs to jointly test rare variants
has become prevalent (Wu et al., 2010, 2011). In our new ap—
proach, we marry the aforementioned uses of LMMs to perform
set tests in the presence of confounders within a single, robust
and well—defined statistical model.

Because of the aforementioned equivalence, our approach can
also be viewed as a form of linear regression with two distinct
sets of covariates. The first set of covariates consists of SNPs that
correct for confounders (and other causal SNPs), i.e. those that
predict race and relatedness, for example. Inclusion of these SNP
covariates makes the data for individuals independently and
identically distributed (i.e. knowing the value of these SNPs in—
duces a common distribution from which the individuals are
drawn). The second set of covariates consists of SNPs for a
given set of interest, such as those SNPs belonging to a gene.
We call our approach FaST—LMM—Set.

Computing the likelihood for our modelian LMM with two
random effectsiis, naively, extremely expensive, as it scales cu—
bically with the number of individuals (e.g. Listgarten et al.,
2010). For example, on the 15000 individual WTCCC dataset
we analyse, currently available algorithms would need to com—
pute and store in memory genetic similarity matrices of dimen—
sion 15 000 x 15 000 and repeatedly perform cubic operations on
them to test just a single set of SNPsia practically infeasible
approach. However, extending our previous work that made
LMMs with a single random effect linear in the number of indi—
viduals (Lippert et al., 2011) to the two—variance component
model needed here, we bypass this computational bottleneck,
yielding a new two—random—effects algorithm, which is linear in
the number of individuals. This advance enables us to analyse
datasets, which could not otherwise be practically analysed, such
as the 15000 individual WTCCC cohort (The Wellcome Trust
Case Control, 2007). As a case in point, using the naive cubic
approach to test the gene set IL23R (containing 14 SNPs) took
13 h as compared with 1 min for our new approach (all on a
single processor), demonstrating a speedup factor of 780 (and
significantly less memory usage because the genetic similarity
matrix need never be computed with our approach).

2 METHODS

Let N(v|u;E) denote a multivariate Normal distribution in v with mean u
and covariance matrix )2. The log likelihood of a one-variance-compo-
nent LMM in the linear regression view is given by

L

LL zlog/N<y|Xﬂ+\/s

VW; 03]) -N(w|0; 0:1)dw,

where y is a 1 X N vector of phenotype values for N individuals; [3 is the
set of the ﬁxed effects of the covariates stored in the design matrix X; I is
an N X N identity matrix; :73 is the residual variance in the regression; w
are the 1 X N random effects for the SNPs stored in the design matrix
V (dimension N X s), and N w|0; 0:1 is the distribution for the
weight parameters. That is, the random regression weights, w are margin-
alized over independent Normal distributions with equal variance 0:.

Equivalently, and more typically, the log likelihood is written with
random effects marginalized out,

LL = log N<y|Xﬂ; a§I+ agK),

where the genetic similarity (called the kernel in some contexts), K, is
given by K2; VVT, as is the case, for example, when K is the realized
relationship matrix (Hayes et al., 2009; Lippert et al., 2011). Given this
equivalence, the SNPs used to estimate genetic similarity (those in V) can
be interpreted as a set of covariates in the regression.

In our model, we partition the random effects into two sets: one set of
random effects, wc (with design matrix VC), is used to correct for con-
founders (and condition on causal SNPs) using so SNPs, whereas the
other set, ws, is used to test the SN SNPs of interest in the corresponding
design matrix, VS. The log likelihood (in the linear regression view) is
then written

VC Vs 2
LL 2 l N X ' I
og/f (yl mews

-N(wC|O; agl)N(wS|0; a§1)dwcdws,

 

 

where each set of random effects has a separate variance (0% and cg).
Again, we can equivalently write this in the marginalized form,

0'2 0'2
LL 2 logN<y|Xﬂ; a§I+ i VCVg + i VSVg).
SC SN

For convenience, we re-parameterize this as
LL =10gN(y|Xﬁ;a§I+ a§[(1 — r)KC + rm), (1)

where now the covariance matrix, K, has been partitioned into two vari-
ance components:

K E (1 — r)KC + rKS,

using KC Ech V; (VC is of dimension N X so) to account for con-
founders and K S E  VS V; (V5 is of dimension N X 35) to model
signal from a pre-deﬁned set of SNPs of interest, such as those within
a gene. The scalar parameter r e [0, 1] is estimated from the data by, for
example, restricted maximum likelihood. The null model for our set test is
given by r = 0, whereas the alternative model allows 1 z r z 0.

Until lately, estimating the parameters and computing the likelihood of
a LMM was cubic in the number of individuals. However, we have re-
cently shown that when the number of SNPs used to estimate genetic
similarity, s, is less than the cohort size, N, and when genetic similarity
matrix, K, factors as VVT (Vof dimension N X s), then the computations
(and memory requirement) become linear in N (Lippert et al., 2011). So
far this result has been applied in the context of correcting for confoun-
ders in a univariate GWAS with just a single variance component.
Originally the s SNPs for inclusion in V were obtained by sampling
SNPs genome-wide and relying on linkage disequilibrium (Lippert
et al., 2011). However, in light of the equivalence with linear regression,
it became clear that one should choose the SNPs with feature selection as
one would do in any statistical modelling problem (Lippert et al., 2013b;
Listgarten et al., 2012, 2013). For example, one can do an uncorrected
univariate scan of the SNPs to select those which should be used to
correct for confounders (and causal SNPs to condition on), and this is
precisely the approach we take here, just as in (Lippert et al., 2013b;
Listgarten et al., 2012).

Thus, in our approach, we select so SNPs for KC by ﬁrst sorting all
available SNPs according to their univariate linear-regression P-values (in
increasing order) and then evaluate the use of more and more SNPs in
order until we ﬁnd an optimal number of SNPs (Listgarten et al., 2012).
This resulted in 650 and 310 SNPs for the Genetic Analysis Workshop 14
(GAW14) and Crohn’s analyses, respectively. Additionally, any SNPs
that were being tested (i.e. those in V5), and those within 2 centimorgans,
were removed from VC so as not to contaminate the null model
(Listgarten et al., 2012). This type of approach for correction of confoun-
ders in univariate tests has previously been demonstrated to work well on
a broad range of datasets (Listgarten et al., 2012). The same conclusions
apply for a variant of this approach using out-of-sample prediction
(Lippert et al., 2013b).

For estimation of variance parameters and computation of the likeli-
hood ratio test (LRT) statistic, we use restricted maximum likelihood,
which is itself a valid likelihood for the LRT and can be computed in the
same time and memory complexity as the (unrestricted) likelihood.
Details on efficient parameter estimation are provided in (Lippert et al.,
2011).

When testing sets in an uncorrected manner, that is, without account-
ing for confounders (which we did for comparison purposes), we omitted
the portion of the variance that corrected for confounders, KC. In par-
ticular, we set I = 1 and tested the significance of (ti with the same LRT
described next.

2.1 P—value computation

We have now fully speciﬁed our model for doing set tests when confoun-
ders are present. To obtain a P-value on the set of SNPs of interest, such
as those belonging to a gene (i.e. those in VS), we use an LRT. In par-
ticular, to test the signiﬁcance of the set of SNPs of interest, we compare
the maximum restricted likelihood of the data with and without the set of
SNPs of interest, that is, the maximum restricted likelihood of the alter-
native and null models. More formally, our null hypothesis is given by
H0 :1' = 0, whereas our alternative hypothesis is given by H“ : 1 z r z 0.
To obtain calibrated P-values, we require an accurate estimate of the
distribution of statistics under the null hypothesis. However, obtaining a
sufﬁciently accurate estimate of this distribution is not straight-forward.
Standard software uses a parametric form for this distribution of
0.5 xi : 0.5xiia 5(P50 mixture of two x2 distributions, the ﬁrst with
zero degrees of freedom and the other with one degree of freedom. The
former accounts for the fact that the tested parameter is on the boundary
of the allowed space in the null model (Dominicus et al., 2006; Self and
Liang, 1987)7that is, to account for the fact that r = 0 in the null model
and 1 z r z 0 in the alternative. The necessary regularity conditions for
this null distribution to hold, include that the outcome variable can be
partitioned into a large number of identically and independently distrib-
uted sub-vectors (Greven et al., 2008)4conditions that are not generally
met in our setting because individuals may be arbitrarily related to one
another. It has been shown that when the regularity conditions are not
met, the 0.5 xi : 0.5 xi distribution yields conservative P-values (Greven
et al., 2008) because the mixing weight on the xi component is too low at
50%. We have also found this to be the case in our setting (Table 1).
Although one might consider use of a parametric bootstrap to estimate
the null distribution, (e.g. Greven et al., 2008), such an approach dramat-
ically increases the running time over computation of the test statistics
themselves because of the extremely large number of bootstrap test stat-
istics needed. Yet, another alternative is to use an empirical distribution
based on permutations, which faces a similar problem. However, one can
use many fewer permutations by instead assuming a parametric form of
the null distribution and then ﬁtting the few required parameters to the
test statistics generated from the permutations (Lee et al., 2012b). It is
such an approach that we take here. This approach assumes that the null
distribution of test statistics is the same across all tests, an assumption

that has also been made in the small sample correction in SKAT-O and
elsewhere (Greven, 2007; Greven et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2012b).

The parametric form of the null distribution that we assume, and to
which we ﬁt null distribution test statistics to, is inspired by (Greven,
2007; Greven et al., 2008), who reported that a mixture of xi and a xi,
where a is the scaling parameter for the scaled chi-square distribution,
yielded good type I control when testing a variance component in a
single-component LMM. We use the same parametric form of the null
distribution, except, to gain additional ﬂexibility for the two-component
LMM, we allow the degrees of freedom on the second component, d, to
be different from 1 (ﬁnding this to be useful in the sense that we estimate
d 75 1). That is, we use the null distribution, nxi : (1 — rt)axi with free
parameters 71, a and d. Using this distributional form, we found that a ﬁt
of the free parameters to the (full collection of test) statistics yielded P-
values that were too liberal in the tail (Table 1). Thus, we instead ﬁt our
parametric parameters using only the most signiﬁcant tail of the null
distribution of test statisticsiin particular, the top 10% of null test stat-
istics (In our experiments with just a single variance component, P-values
were also liberal in the tailithose for which P < 0.05. This regime was
not examined by Greven et al.).

We now describe the details of our approach for estimating the free
parameters, 71, a and d, of this null distribution. To generate a single null
test statistic for a set, we permuted the individuals for only the SNPs in
that set. Because we do not permute the SNPs (rather, the individuals),
the pattern of linkage disequilibrium between the SNPs within a single
test remains intact. Although we permute the individuals, who are not
(generally) identically and independently distributed, we do so only for
the SNPs in the test set, leaving any confounding signal among the cov-
ariates, the confounding SNPs and the phenotype intact. We found that
null distribution parameter estimates stabilized with the use of 10 permu-
tations per test (for both WTCCC and GAW14). Thus, our procedure
has a runtime roughly a factor of 10 larger than if we had not needed
permutations. Within a gene, we use the same permutation for all SNPs,
and we used the same 10 permutations across all sets.

Given this permutation-generated sample of test statistics from the null
distribution, we ﬁt the parameters 71, a and d as follows. The xi distri-
bution is a Dirac delta function at 07that is, this component of the null
distribution yields only test statistics of 0, and correspondingly P = 1.
Furthermore, the xi>0 yields a test statistic of 0 with measure zero.
Consequently, one can obtain good estimates of the parameters simply
by assuming that precisely those tests with variance parameter estimate
1' = 0 belong to the xi component, and then estimating 7'! as the propor-
tion of tests belonging to this component. We then estimate a and d
directly from the non-zero test statistics (those likely to belong to the
a xi component) using a regression in which these parameters are adjusted
such that resulting LRT P-values have the least squared error with the
theoretical P-values (derived conditionally on an estimate of 71).
Speciﬁcally, we use the log P-value squared error and only use the smal-
lest 10% of P-values in the regression. This truncated regression ap-
proach consistently yielded calibrated quantilewluantile plots (Fig. 1)

and also controlled type I error (Table 1). Furthermore, it yielded better
power than the score test (Table 2).

In summary, our overall approach is as follows: (i) for each set to be
tested, permute the individuals of the SNPs belonging to this set, all in the
same manner; (ii) compute the restricted LRT statistic for this permuted
data to obtain a test statistic from the null distribution; (iii) repeat step 1
ten times; (iv) estimate the proportion of test statistics drawn from the xi
component, fr, as the proportion of tests in which the parameter r = 0; (v)
use the largest 10% of test statistics to perform a regression to ﬁt the axi
componentithat is, ﬁnd ti and d, which minimize the squared error of
the log10 P-values with their theoretical values [uniform distribution on
(fr, 1)]; and (vi) compute the test statistic for all sets (non-permuted data)
and then compute the corresponding P-values for these using the null
distribution ﬁxi : (1 — ﬂax?

In application to real data (described next), our procedure yielded
7'! = 0.641,a = 2.29, d=0.961, on the GAW14 data, and TI: 0.643,
a = 1.41, d = 0.85 on the WTCCC data.

2.2 Datasets and other methods

The ﬁrst dataset was obtained from the GAW14 (Edenberg et al., 2005).
It consisted of autosomal SNP data from an Affymetrix SNP panel and a

phenotype indicating whether an individual smoked a pack of cigarettes a
day or more for 6 months or more. The cohort included over eight
ethnicities and numerous close family members71034 individuals in
the dataset had parents, children or siblings also in the dataset. In add-
ition to the curation provided by GAW, we excluded a SNP when either
(i) its minor allele frequency was <0.05, (ii) its values were missing in
>10% of the population or (iii) its allele frequencies were not in Hardyi
Weinberg equilibrium (P<0.001). In addition, we excluded an individual
when >10% of SNP values were missing. After ﬁltering, there were 7579
SNPs across 1261 individuals.

The second dataset comprised the WTCCC 1 data and consisted of
SNP and phenotype data for seven common diseases: bipolar disorder,
coronary artery disease, hypertension, Crohn’s disease, rheumatoid
arthritis, type-I diabetes and type-II diabetes (The Wellcome Trust
Case Control, 2007). Each phenotype set contained ~1900 individuals.
In addition, the data included a set of ~1500 controls from the UK
Blood Service Control Group (NBS). The data did not include a
second control group from the 1958 British Birth Cohort (58C), as
restrictions on it precluded use by a commercial organization. Our
analysis for the Crohn’s phenotype used data from the NBS group
and the remaining six phenotypes as controls (Lippert et al., 2013a).
We ﬁltered SNPs as described by the WTCCC (Laaksovirta et al.,
2010) and additionally excluded an SNP if either its minor-allele fre-
quency was <1%, it was missing in >1% of individuals or its genetic
distance was unknown. After ﬁltering, 356 441 SNPs remained. Unlike
the approach used by the WTCCC, we included non-white individuals
and close family members to increase the potential for confounding
and thereby better exercise the LMM. In total, there were 14925 in-
dividuals across the seven phenotypes and control, as in our previous
work (Lippert et al., 2011; Lippert et al., 2013a; Listgarten et al.,
2012). We concentrated our evaluations on Crohn’s disease, as inﬂa-
tion for this phenotype was greatest with an uncorrected univariate
analysis.

For the WTCCC data, we grouped SNPs into gene sets using gene
positions provided on the USCSC Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.
edu/) (Dreszer et al., 2012; Kent at al., 2002) using build th9 (we also
converted the original WTCCC annotations to this build), which yielded
13 850 gene sets. Because the GAW14 SNPs mapped to only 251 non-
singleton gene sets with this strategy, we instead formed sets for this
dataset by using overlapping 1 centimorgan windows, yielding 2157
sets. For WTCCC, the set sizes ranged from 1 to 748, with a mean
value of 11 and a standard deviation of 24. For the GAW14 data, the
set sizes ranged from 2 to 38, with a mean value of 5 and a standard
deviation of 4. More generally, this approach of forming sets from win-
dows of nearby SNPs along the genome could be used to map an entire
genome into sets, even when the SNPs do not lie in genes. However, it is
not our goal here to evaluate different ways in which one might group
SNPs, but instead to demonstrate that we can test sets of SNPs in the
presence of confounders.

All analyses assumed additive effects of a SNP on phenotype, using a
0/1/2 encoding for each SNP (indicating the number of minor alleles for
an individual). Missing SNP data were mean imputed. Multiple testing
was accounted for with a Bonferroni correction.

In counting hits for Crohn’s disease (Table 4), we omitted any
genes found in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region
because this region is complicated by long-range linkage disequilibrium.
We used positions 2934 Mb on chromosome 6 as the boundaries of the
MHC, as suggested by the MHC-sequencing consortium (Pereyra et al.,
2010).

2.3 Experimental setup to assess control of type I error
and power

We used synthetic data based on the real WTCCC data to assess the
quality of our new method, as well as to compare it against a score

test. In particular, to assess type I error, we used all SNPs from the
WTCCC dataset, and then permuted the individuals for SNPs in each
set tested so as to create null-only test statistics. We permuted the data in
this way a total of 72 times, yielding 997200 null test statistics (because
13 850 sets were tested for each dataset). We additionally permuted an-
other 10 datasets to estimate the parameters of the null distribution
(TI, a, d) as prescribed by our approach.

For assessment of power, we again used all SNPs from the WTCCC
dataset and then generated synthetic phenotypes using an LMM. To
do so, we ﬁrst we ﬁt the null model to the real data to obtain
estimates of the parameters (ti and :72. Then we used the model
p(y) = N(y|0;aiKc+qus]), with confounding variance (Ii equal to
estimated environmental noise, (ti = 0.094, and genetic variance, (Ii,
equal to the estimated genetic variance (ti = 0.0125. Furthermore, we
used the same 310 confounding SNPs for KC as used on the real data
while using all 321839 SNPs further than 2 centimorgans away from
those in KC as the causal SNPs for KS (those contained in the true posi-
tive sets in our power experiments). We generated ﬁve phenotypes in this
way. The resulting phenotypes behaved much like the real data in that, on
average, we found 10 Bonferroni-corrected sets on each of ﬁve datasets,
as compared with the 23 found on the real data (note that Table 4 does
not include SNPs from the MHC region and therefore shows only 16).
For both type I error and power experiments, we tested the same gene sets
as on the real data, except for power, we did not include any gene sets
containing SNPs in the VC (those SNPs used to correct for confounding)
or within 2 centimorgans of these SNPs, to be sure that the sets were
unambiguously true positives.

When comparing our LRT approach against a score-based test,
we used the same score test as the Sequence Kernel Association
Test (SKAT) (Wu et al., 2011), which uses the Davies method to
compute P-values from the null distribution (but here with our
FaST-LMM-Set model). This score test has previously been shown
to control type I error (Lee et al., 2012b), consistent with our own
ﬁndings (not shown).

2.4 Linear-time computations

What remains left to explain is how to achieve the linear-time speedup in
the present settingithe case of two random effects. The crux of the cubic
to linear-time speedup in the single random effect model was to bypass
construction of K and the required spectral decomposition of K by recog-
nizing that one can instead use V and the spectral decomposition of V
(Lippert et al., 2011). We can view the two random-effects model as
a single random effect with covariance K E (1 — r)Kc +rKs. To use
the algebraic speed-up just mentioned, we observed that K: VVT,
where now

1 l 1 l
V:  VC(1— r)-, E Vsrz],
using [U; W] to denote the side-by-side concatenation of matrices U
and W. So long as s=sx+sC<N, which was true for all of the
datasets examined here (and almost all others we have analyzed), we
obtained the linear-time computations and memory footprint just as in
Lippert et a]. (2011). [One might also consider using low rank update
equations of the type used in Listgarten et a]. (2012) to perform ex-
clusion, although we have not yet implemented this] Finally, to per-
form parameter estimation in this two random-effects model, we used
an approach similar to that reported in Lippert et a]. (2011). That is,
we used a 1D Brent search optimization routine to ﬁnd the value of t,
which maximized the restricted likelihood. For each call to the re-
stricted likelihood for a particular value of r, efﬁcient computations
were performed as in (Lippert et al., 2011), except using the two
random effects.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Type I error and power on synthetic data

First, we examined whether our LRT approach controlled type I
error. As described in Section 2, we generated null—only test stat—
istics by way of permutations on the WTCCC data, obtaining a
total of roughly 1 million test statistics. The type I error was
controlled (Table 1). Neither (1) fitting the null distribution par—
ameters (to all test statistics) by way of maximum likelihood nor
(2) use of a 0.5 xi : 0.5 xi null distribution, yielded calibrated
P—values. The ﬁrst was liberal, whereas the latter was conserva—
tive (Table 1). Finally, quantileAiuantile plots in Figure 1 add—
itionally demonstrates good calibration over the entire range of
P—values from our method, for the same points as in Table 1.
Because the score test we used has already been shown to control
type I error (Lee et al., 2012b), we do not report on it here, but
we did find the same in our own experiments (not shown).

Next, we compared the power of our LRT approach to a score
test approach (both using the same two random effects model)
on synthetic data (see Section 2). Over five synthetic datasets and
a range of signiﬁcance levels, LRT found signiﬁcantly more sets
than the score test (Table 2). Furthermore, on the real WTCCC
data, LRT again found significantly more sets (Table 4).

3.2 Application to real data

We investigated our new approach on two datasets. The ﬁrst was
the GAW14, which included data from over eight ethnicities and
numerous close family members for a total of 1261 individuals.
After ﬁltering, there were 7579 SNPs available for analysis. The
second dataset was from the WTCCC from which we used 14 925
individuals and 356441 SNPs in our analysis. We used the
Crohn’s phenotypes because this was the one showing the most
confounding in an uncorrected analysis. Unlike the WTCCC
(The Wellcome Trust Case Control, 2007), we included non—
white data for individuals and close family members to increase
power and because the LMM can treat them properly (Astle and
Balding, 2009; Kang et al., 2010; Price et al., 2010).

To judge the degree of confounding due to genetic relatedness,
and to ensure that our LMM approach could sufﬁciently correct
for confounding, we ran both an uncorrected and corrected uni—
variate analysis on each dataset because this is a well—understood
test that has been reported on before. Here, the extent of test
statistic inﬂation owing to unmodelled confounders was assessed
using the A statistic, also known as the inﬂation factor from
genomic control (Devlin and Roeder, 1999). The value A is
deﬁned as the ratio of the median observed to median theoretical
test statistic. Values of A substantially greater than (less than) 1.0
are indicative of inﬂation (deﬂation). As can be seen in Table 3,
without correction, the test statistics appear to be inﬂated.
Although one might consider AGC = 1.08 (seen on the corrected
analysis of WTCCC) as still moderately inﬂated, it has been
shown that complex, highly polygenic traits lead to increases in
AGC (Yang et al., 2011) in the absence of spurious signal.
Moreover, the WTCCC themselves reported AGC in the range
of 10871.11 on removal of individuals from different races and
related individuals (neither of which we removed), and also on
adjustment with two principal components, suggesting that a AGC

of 1.08 is the result of polygenic inﬂuence (The Wellcome Trust
Case Control, 2007).

Having established that both of our datasets required correc—
tion for confounders and that the LMM with our chosen back—
ground genetic similarity matrix, KS, sufﬁciently corrected for
confounders, we next applied FaST—LMM—Set, using the same
LMM—correcting component as in the univariate test. The full set
of results is available for all analyses in Supplementary Table Sl.
On GAW14, the uncorrected set analysis yielded 241 significant
sets, whereas FaST—LMM—Set, which corrects for confounding,
yielded none. It is thought that this dataset contains little, if any
signal (e. g. based on the univariate analysis). On WTCCC
Crohn’s disease, an uncorrected set analysis yielded 26 significant
sets, whereas FaST—LMM—Set yielded 16 (Table 4). Next, we
investigate these sets in detail.

To validate the signiﬁcant sets recovered on the WTCCC
Crohn’s phenotype, we used a meta—analysis (Franke et al.,
2010; Listgarten et al., 2012). If a set we found as signiﬁcant
was within 50 kilobases of a validated SNP/region, we counted
it as a true positive. Additionally, for the genes not validated by
the meta—analysis, we conducted a literature search. Detailed val—
idation results are provided in Supplementary Table Sl. Using
our newly developed method, FaST—LMM—Set, we found 16 sig—
niﬁcant gene sets, of which all but one were validated by the
meta—analysis. The remaining gene, SLC24A4, performs a similar
function to the validated gene SLC22APboth are cation trans—
porters [www.genecards.org (Rebhan et al., 1997)%suggesting a
promising candidate for follow—up.

3.3 Advantages of set tests over univariate tests

In the course of our analyses, we noticed that some sets with
small P—values had almost no univariate signal in any of the
SNPs. In particular, among the 16 sets in the WTCCC data
supported by either meta—analysis or literature search, six
(Clorf 141, SAG, SLC24A4, SLC22A4, TCTA and PTPN2)
were missed by the univariate analysis (i.e. an SNP lying
within 50 kilobases of any of the regions reported by Frank
et a]. was not found to be signiﬁcant). One of the motivations
for doing set analysis is to uncover signals for such regions. The
intuition here is the same as in a univariate conditional GWAS
analysis. That is, conditioning on variables can lead to an in—
crease in power, revealing signal that would be hidden without
the conditioning (Atwell et al., 2010; Segura et al., 2012). Thus,
the set test acts not only to aggregate weak signal but also to
unmask signal hidden by covariates included by virtue of doing a
set test. We investigated one such case in detail. In particular, we
computed the univariate P—values for each of the 15 SNPs asso—
ciated with the gene SLC22A4, marginally, as well as conditioned
on all the other SNPs in this gene, using an LMM to correct for
confounding. This gene was found to be associated with Crohn’s
disease using FaST—LMM—Set with P = 7.6 x 10‘s. The smallest
marginal univariate P—value was 1.2 x 10’s, but when we condi—
tioned on the other SNPs in the set, the smallest conditional
univariate P—value obtained was 7.0 x 108. This result demon—
strates the increased power afforded by the set test owing to the
interplay of SNPs within the gene that is missed by a univariate
approach.

3.4 Signiﬁcance of sets is independent of set size

On data with phenotypic association, we expected that there
could be correlation between set size and P—value because with
a larger set, there could be more predictive SNPs and more
power. Furthermore, we expected that when confounders were
not properly accounted for in the set analysis, that the more
SNPs in a set, the more power the set would have to detect
these confounders, and therefore the stronger the correlation be—
tween set size and P—value would appear. The correlations on our
real data were consistent with these expectations. In particular,
we saw no signiﬁcant correlation for FaST—LMM—Set (which
corrects for confounders) but signiﬁcant correlation when we
did not correct for confounders (Table 5).

We also expected that on null—only data, when confounders
were properly accounted for, the set P—value and set size would
be independent. Consistent with this expectation, when we per—
muted the Crohn’s phenotype to remove signal, the FaST—
LMM—Set correlation was reduced to ,0 = 0.019 (P2018).

4 DISCUSSION

We have developed a novel efﬁcient approach for testing sets of
genetic markers in the presence of confounding structure such as
arises from ethnic diversity and family relatedness within a
cohort. Application of this algorithm demonstrated that our
method corrects for confounders and uncovers signal not recov—
erable by univariate analysis.

Although we did not analyse rare variant data, we have shown
elsewhere that the underlying LMM methodology works well to

correct for confounding due to rare variants in a univariate set—
ting (Listgarten et al., 2013). Furthermore, others have already
shown that LMM—based set tests work well for detection of sets
of associated rare variants (Wu et al., 2011). It follows that the
hybrid approach that we presented here is likely to prove effect—
ive in the setting of testing sets of rare variants in the presence of
confounders, although this remains to be investigated fully. For
example, we have found the use of a linear model on a case
control phenotype to yield inﬂated tests statistics when testing
rare variants.

We have demonstrated that our LRT outperforms a score test
for our model and setting. This is perhaps unsurprising, given that
the score test can be viewed as an approximation to the LRT by a
second—order Taylor series expansion (Buse, 2007) in the neigh—
bourhood of the null model. Furthermore, given its robust prop—
erties, the LRT is considered the benchmark for statistical testing
(Crainiceanu, 2008). We note, however, that in some recent work
(Lin and Tang, 2011), when testing for rare variants using a
logistic ﬁxed effects model, a score test was found to perform
better than LRT, which was found to be liberal. Although the
best test may depend on context, we note that Lin et al. used
a different model than we did and, in particular, did not use
a variance component approach. Also, they used closed—forrn
asymptotic—based LRT P—values rather than making use of em—
pirically derived null distributions as we have done here.

For many cases of hidden structure in genetic data, the use of
principal component—based covariates is sufﬁcient for correction
(Price et al., 2006), and thus these covariates could immediately
be added to existing models such as SKAT (Wu et al., 2011) to
achieve a set test that corrects for confounding. However, it is
now widely accepted that there are various forms of confoun—
ders, which cannot be corrected for by principal components, but
for which an LMM adequately corrects (Kang et al., 2010; Price
et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2006), and it is for these problems that we
have developed our approach.

We here focused on testing SNPs in a manner similar to SKAT
(Wu et al., 2011). However, it would be straightforward to also
adapt FaST—LMM—Set to the approach of SKAT—O, in which
the original SKAT model is in effect combined with a collapsing—
type approach (Lee et al., 2012a, 2012b).

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Experiments such as ChlP-chip, ChlP-seq, ChlP-PET
and DamlD (the four methods referred herein as ChlP-X) are used to
profile the binding of transcription factors to DNA at a genome-wide
scale. Such experiments provide hundreds to thousands of potential
binding sites for a given transcription factor in proximity to gene
coding regions.

Results: In order to integrate data from such studies and utilize
it for further biological discovery, we collected interactions from
such experiments to construct a mammalian ChlP-X database. The
database contains 189933 interactions, manually extracted from
87 publications, describing the binding of 92 transcription factors
to 31932 target genes. We used the database to analyze mRNA
expression data where we perform gene-list enrichment analysis
using the ChlP-X database as the prior biological knowledge gene-
list library. The system is delivered as a web-based interactive
application called ChlP Enrichment Analysis (ChEA). With ChEA,
users can input lists of mammalian gene symbols for which the
program computes over-representation of transcription factortargets
from the ChlP-X database. The ChEA database allowed us to
reconstruct an initial network of transcription factors connected
based on shared overlapping targets and binding site proximity. To
demonstrate the utility of ChEA we present three case studies. We
show how by combining the Connectivity Map (CMAP) with ChEA,
we can rank pairs of compounds to be used to target specific
transcription factor activity in cancer cells.

1 INTRODUCTION

Gene expression proﬁling using microarrays, or now RNA-seq, are
popular methods to measure the level of mRNA in mammalian
cells at a genome-wide scale. Yet, since mRNA levels only

weakly correlate with protein level, data collected from mRNA
proﬁling provides little clues on how cells are regulated by the
activity of transcription factors, co-regulator complexes and cell
signaling pathways. Many methods have been applied to study
transcriptional regulation both experimentally and computationally.
Recently, large-scale experimental methods that proﬁle the binding
of transcription factors to DNA at the genome-wide level have
emerged. These methods include ChIP-chip (Iyer et (11., 2001), ChIP-
seq (Johnson et (11., 2007), ChIP-PET (Wei et (11., 2006) and DamID
(Vogel et (11., 2007) (these four methods are referred to as ChIP-
X for shorthand hereinafter). Results from such experiments report
the binding of speciﬁc transcription factors to DNA in proximity
of target gene loci, commonly listing hundreds to thousands of
potential regulatory interactions. Such interactions are often reported
in Excel spreadsheets or PDF tables as Supplementary Materials to
research articles, or as raw data ﬁles provided as short-sequence-
reads in FASTA format, making such data difﬁcult for reuse.
So far, information from genome-wide ChIP-X studies, as well
as low-throughput transcription-factor/DNA interaction studies, is
utilized to develop binding-site sequence-motifs. For example,
JASPAR (Sandelin et (11., 2004) and TRANSFAC (Matys et (11.,
2003) are two popular databases that collect information about
potential binding sites into logo-motifs also known as binding-site
matrices. These databases contain collections of transcription factors
with information on regulatory-motif elements. With binding-
site matrices, it is straight forward to map potential binding
sites across an entire genome. Alternatively, conserved sequences
near gene-coding regions across and within species can suggest
transcription-factor binding sites and be used to improve predictions
of functional transcription-factor/DNA interactions using multiple
alignments combined with logo-motif search. The obvious emerging
alternative method is to utilize ChIP-X data for linking transcription
factors to gene expression changes by computing binding site over-
representation. By compiling ChIP-X experiments into a gene-list
library database, we can rank transcription factors most likely
responsible for the observed changes in gene expression based
on statistical enrichment analysis. We show that this method is
powerﬁil, capable of capturing interesting underlying biology with
clear signals. Such an approach likely works well because it
considers the chromatin structure of a speciﬁc cellular state, in
a speciﬁc experiment; and as such, it is a more direct way to
infer transcription factor regulation compared to sequence-based
methods.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

We manually collected data from ChIP-X experiments into a
database of gene lists by extracting lists from the supporting
materials of publications. In this ChIP-X database, each record
contains a list of genes potentially regulated by a speciﬁc
transcription factor under a speciﬁc condition. We only included
publications that describe ChIP-X experiments applied to proﬁle
human or mouse cells. Besides manually extracting the gene lists
reported by the authors from the publications’ supporting materials,
when it was possible and available, we also generated gene lists
directly from the raw data ﬁles that belong to each publication.
We implemented our own method for indexing, peak calling and
gene matching to process the raw ChIP-seq and ChIP-chip data
using a standard process (see Supplementary data for detail). The
manually curated portion of the database as of July 26, 2010 contains
189 933 extracted interactions, from 84 publications, describing the
binding of 92 transcription factors to 31932 target genes. Several
publications reported target genes for more than one factor, and
several factors were proﬁled by different groups using different
conditions and cell types. The automatically generated portion of
the database contains 19 ChIP-seq and 10 ChIP-chip publications
with 203 ChIP-seq and 22 ChIP-chip individual experiments.
Both parts of this ChIP-X database are expected to continually
grow. Additionally, since peak height varies signiﬁcantly across
experiments, we also implemented an interactive visualization tool
that gives users the control to dynamically set the peak height cut-off
for a speciﬁc experiment using a slider (Fig. 1).

For comparing input gene lists across species, human and mouse
gene IDs were merged using homologene. However, species are
separated in the database and the user can perform the analysis on
each species separately. The automatically generated lists displayed
more variability in total gene calling per experiment per transcription

same indexing and peak calling methods. This suggests that there is
intrinsic variability in average peak height and number of identiﬁed
peaks across different ChIP-seq and ChIP-chip experimensts. The
ChIP-X database is utilized to create a web-based interactive
software application called ChIP Enrichment Analysis (ChEA)
(Fig. 2). With ChEA, users can cut and paste input lists of
mammalian gene symbols, typically gene lists that signiﬁcantly
changed in expression level from genome-wide gene expression
proﬁling studies. Then, the software computes over-representation
for targets of transcription factors from the ChIP-X database. To
compute statistical enrichment, we implemented the Fisher exact
test with the Bonferroni’s correction, where the proportions for
the test are the number of genes in the input list, the number
of genes identiﬁed in the ChIP-X experiment, the genes that are
shared among the two lists and the number of overall targets in
the ChIP-X database (~30 000). The program reports a ranked list
of ChIP-X experiments that show statistically signiﬁcant overlap
with the input list. Indentiﬁed genes from the input list, potentially
regulated by a speciﬁc transcription factor, are also connected and
visualized as a network using known protein—protein interactions.
To construct the protein—protein interaction network we used the
networks we consolidated for the program Genes2Networks (Berger
et (11., 2007), as well as all mammalian interactions downloaded
from the KEGG pathway database (Kanehisa et (11., 2008). The
ChEA software application and the interactive features of the ChIP-
X database are implemented with JavaScript, AJAX, Java Server
Pages, with a back-end MySQL database, as well as an interactive
Adobe Flash-based network and peak-calling viewer developed
using ActionScript 3.0. The system can also be downloaded and
installed as a standalone Java desktop application, or as a command-
line tool. The tool also provides search capabilities for ﬁnding
transcription factor regulators for speciﬁc genes, or for ﬁnding

3 RESULTS
3.1 Overlapping target genes among transcription
factors

The collection of gene lists for each transcription factor from the
ChIP-X studies allows us to reconstruct initial distance matrices
that connect transcription factors based on different measures of
binding site similarity. The ﬁrst approach is based on shared target
genes. If two factors share many targets, it is likely that they
regulate genes together and potentially physically interact. We used
the Jaccard Coefﬁcient and hierarchical clustering to visualize such
overlap (Fig. 3; Supplementary Figs S2—S5). Such analysis unravels
known clusters linking the polycomb group members near the self-
renewal embryonic stem-cell members, and clustering cancer related
oncogenic transcription factors such as Myc and Cyclin-Dl, as well
as less obvious relations. Similarity between pairs of transcription
factors proﬁled using ChIP-X studies can be ﬁirther examined by
looking at the proximity of binding peaks. Hence, the second type
of distance matrix counts the number of proximal peaks for pair-
wise factors (Supplementary Figs S6 and S7 and Supplementary
Material). Given an arbitrary threshold, such distance matrices can
be transformed into networks (Supplementary Figs S8—S10). Such

networks can be used to ﬁirther visualize potential transcription
factor complexes and help in placing new ChIP-X results within
the context of nuclear transcription regulators from prior studies
based on target similarity, binding proximity and protein—protein
interactions.

3.2 Case studies: gene expression analyses with ChEA

To demonstrate the useﬁilness of ChEA we used the ChIP-X
database for the analysis of mRNA expression data. We demonstrate
the utility of the system for three different applications: The ﬁrst
case study is the re-analysis of gene lists that were extracted as
biomarker features from two studies that developed a classiﬁer for
breast cancer metastasis using tissue from patients proﬁled with
mRNA expression microarrays. The second application is the re-
analysis of microarray data collected after over-expression of key
transcription factors in embryonic stem cells. Whereas the last
example cross references the ChIP-X database with the connectivity
map (CMAP), a database of over 6000 chemical perturbations
followed by results from genome-wide gene-expression microarrays
(Lamb et (11., 2006). Joining the ChIP-X and CMAP databases
provides predictions for combinations of small molecule drugs that
could be used to potentially down-regulate Myc activity in different
cancers.

3.3 Case study 1: linking breast cancer signature genes
to transcription factors

The ﬁrst case study demonstrates how the ChEA system can be used
for comparative analysis of two reports that identiﬁed a biomarker
set for invasive breast cancer inferred from microarray studies. In
two independent publications, the authors used two independently
collected compendiums of mRNA expression microarrays from
patients with breast cancer tumors to ﬁnd a signature set of genes that
can differentiate between benign and malignant breast cancers (van’t
Veer et (11., 2002; Wang et (11., 2005). Both studies produced lists of
genes considered as selected feature ‘biomarkers’. Surprisingly, the
two lists, containing 162 and 73 genes, share very little overlap (two
genes) which is statistically insigniﬁcant. However, when both gene
lists are used as input for ChEA separately, they show enrichment
for SMAD2/3 gene targets. The P-value of 2.2E-05 for the list of
73 genes (the third-most signiﬁcant out of all other experiments in
the ChIP-X database) and also 9.5E-05 for the list of the 162 genes
(fourth most signiﬁcant ChIP-X experiment). When the lists are
combined, SMAD2/3 is at the top of the list of enriched factors with
an improved P-value of 9.3E-10 (Table 1; Supplementary Tables
Sl—S4).

Careful examination of the 35 genes that were identiﬁed as
overlapping among the Smad2/3 targets from the two studies point
to several genes that have been previously reported to play a role in
breast cancer metastasis (Supplementary Table S4). In particular,
MMP9 and CD44 are both highly implicated in breast cancer
metastasis. MMP9 and CD44 are listed in GeneRifs for 23 and 17
articles returned by the query search ‘breast cancer’, respectively.
MMP9 is a metalo-protease that digests the extra-cellular matrix
during invasion, whereas changes in CD44 expression likely play
a role in evading the host immune response. The results from the
ChEA analysis clearly implicate that TGF-B/SMAD2/3 signaling
plays a dominant role in breast cancer metastasis and can be used to
further explain the origins of the discrepancy between the original

two studies. It has been well-established that TGF-B/SMAD2/3
signaling is playing an important role in breast cancer metastasis
(Koumoundourou D, 2007; Liapis et (11., 2007; Xie et (11., 2002).
However, the ChEA analysis combined with the microarray proﬁling
provides unbiased global additional support for such hypothesis.
Our results also complement a network analysis approach applied
to the same data using protein interactions. Chuang et (11. (2007)
‘connected’ the breast cancer biomarkers identiﬁed by the two
independent studies using known protein-protein interactions to
ﬁnd that a SMAD2/3 sub-network, among other sub-networks, is
up-regulated in metastasized tumors. Here we linked such results
to transcriptional regulation evidence from ChIP-X studies. Gene-
expression proﬁling from different cancers, collected from patients
or cell types, can now be linked to a transcription factor regulatory
signature using ChEA. Such signature may hint, in a direct way, to
the molecular regulatory mechanisms altered in any speciﬁc cancer
subtype.

3.4 Case study 2: re-analysis of gene over-expression
followed by mRNA proﬁling of mESCs

For the second case study, we re-analyzed results from a report where
the authors over-expressed 50 transcription factors, one-by-one, in
mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and then measured the effect
of such perturbations on gene-expression response using mRNA
microarrays (Nishiyama et (11., 2009). Among the 50 transcription
factors used, all the well-known mESCs regulators are included,
i.e. Oct4, Nanog and Sox2. The study identiﬁed Cdx2 as the
transcription factor with the most dramatic effect when over-
expressed, and as such it was selected for conducting a ChIP-seq
experiment. We re-analyzed the results from the Nishiyama et (11.
study by inputting the top 500 genes that changed mostly as
compared to the control for each of the 50 perturbations using ChEA.
Surprisingly, the two studies that reported ChIP-X results for Suz12
binding appeared as the most statistically enriched for binding sites
for almost all of the perturbations (Fig. 4; Supplementary Table S5).
The P-values for overlap with Suz12 targets were very signiﬁcant,
reaching for example, 1.65E-89 for the up-regulation of Sox9.
Additional conﬁdence is added due to the fact that the ChEA database
contains two independent Suz12 ChIP-X experiments that do not

fully overlap, and both studies appeared at the top for almost all the
gain-of—function experiments. Suz12 is a member of the polycomb
group (PcG) complex responsible for methylation of lysine 9 and
27 of histone 3. Such methylation is known to cause transcriptional
suppression of differentiation genes (Ru and Yi, 2004). Hence, the
fact that all the changes in gene expression observed in this study are
strongly associated with Suz12 targets, regardless of the perturbation
applied to mESCs, may implicate that almost all perturbations
cause differentiation. This suggests that the quantitative level of
many components of the self-renewal machinery must be critically
balanced to maintain the pluripotency state. It seems that the type
of perturbation in itself was less critical as any perturbation induce
similar global changes in chromatin rearrangements.

3.5 Case study 3: cross-referencing ChEA with CMAP
for designing multiple drug treatments for cancer

Another opportunity offered by the ChIP-X database, and the ChEA
gene-list enrichment analysis software, is to combine ChEA with the
Connectivity Map (CMAP) (Lamb, 2006, 2007). Such combination
of databases can be used for identifying and ranking small molecules
that can potentially be used for controlling the activity of speciﬁc
transcription factors. CMAP is a dataset of mRNA microarray
expression proﬁling of drug-stimulated mammalian cancer cells.
CMAP contains ~6000 perturbations with ~1300 single drugs,
sometimes in different concentrations, cell types or other variable
experimental conditions. Examining the genes that increased or
decreased signiﬁcantly after a perturbation, we can use ChEA to
rank the transcription factors that most likely regulate (statistically
over represented transcription factors) the genes that increase or
decrease in expression due to the drug perturbation. This ranking
can be used to design combinations of drugs that can potentially
counteract the activity of speciﬁc transcription factors in a speciﬁc
cellular context (Fig. 5).

Algorithmically, we can deﬁne two families of sets: one describing
the relationship between drugs and the mRNAs they affect based on
CMAP, and the other family of sets describing transcription factors
and their target genes based on entries from the ChIP-X database.
The drug-mRNA family of sets DR contains the top 500 genes that
increased or decreased in expression given drug 1' and perturbation

j from CMAP, and where j is used as the set label. Hence, the
cardinality of all sets DR]~ is always 500. Elements in DR]. sets are
gene symbols. The second family of sets TR is made of target genes
from all the ChIP-X experiments. Hence, TR,- contains gene symbols
reported to be targets of transcription factor 1' in experiment j where
j is the set label. Now we can operate on these families of sets to ﬁnd
the best pair-wise combinations of drugs that cover the target space
for transcription factor 1'. First, we can compute the union of DR
with itself to create a new family of sets DP describing how pairs
of drugs may affect gene expression in an additive manner. For all
DRl- and for all DR]~ where i not equal to j

DPk =DRiUDRj

The additive assumption was chosen for simplicity, however there
is some evidence that it might be reasonable (Geva—Zatorsky et (11.,
2010). Hence DP contains a family of (n2/2)—n sets, where n is
the number of drug perturbation experiments in CMAP. Note that
the family of sets DP contains also genes symbols as the elements
of the sets. We are now ready to score how drug perturbation pairs
may affect the activity of transcription factor k in experiment j . Such
score is simply the intersection between DP and TR,

Score = DP,- r1 TR]~

The scoring scheme can be used to suggest, for example, how
we can use small molecules to induce the activity of speciﬁc
transcription factors such as Oct4 for iPS reprogramming, or for
blocking uncontrolled cell proliferation by targeting Myc. In this
case study, we devise mechanisms to down-regulate the activity
of the transcription factor Myc and hence potentially block the
proliferation of cancer cells. When we examined the results of
inputting all lists of the mostly down-regulated 500 genes as reported
in the ranked lists from CMAP entered in a batch mode into ChEA,
we noticed that Myc appears often as the top-ranked transcription
factor for binding in proximity to genes that decreased in expression
after many drug perturbations. This is expected since Myc is a
known oncogene, and all cell-lines in CMAP are human cancer
cells, and many of the drugs that were used to create CMAP are
anti-cancer drugs. For illustration, we ranked pairs of drugs based
on their combined coverage of Myc targets (Fig. 5). Our strategy
optimizes selection of drug-pairs that do not have similar effects
on Myc targets. Table 2 provides the resulting top 10 pair-wise
entries (a Perl script with an input table is provided as supporting

materials, Script S1, Supplementary Table S6). The top 10-ranked
list of pair-wise drugs suggests combinations of drug treatments for
further maximally reducing Myc transcriptional regulatory activity.
The combinations we identiﬁed include known cancer drugs as well
as other drugs. For example, monastrol is a known cancer drug that
targets kinesin-S, a motor protein important in mitosis (Mayer et (11.,
1999), whereas clonidine is a alpha-adrenergic agonist (Anden et (11.,
1970) that is an anti-hypertensive used to aid sleeping and treat
ADHD. Hence, it is likely acting through a different pathway to
regulate a subset of Myc-regulated target genes. Our initial approach
of combining and ranking pairs of drugs to regulate the activity of
speciﬁc transcription factors can be ﬁirther improved in many ways.
One possibility is to compute the likelihood that a combination of
more than two drugs will cover a speciﬁc transcription factor target
space. This can be achieved, for example, with algorithms such
as the probabilistic generative model for GO enrichment analysis
(Lu et (11., 2008). Our initial formulation can also be extended
by using quantitative values instead of sets, and include statistical
randomization as control. In summary, the approach presented in
this third case study provides a step forward toward rationale
combinatorial application of drugs to treat speciﬁc cancers with
a transcription-factor anchoring. Such an approach is amenable
also for improving iPS reprogramming strategies by, for example,
designing combination of drugs that would activate Oct4 or other
key stem-cell self-renewal factors for reprogramming somatic cells
into iPS cells. Many other similar applications to attempt to control
cell fate are possible. The strategy should also work for other types
of gene expression microarray datasets in other contexts.

4 DISCUSSION

One of the reasons high-throughput genome-wide ChIP-X studies
are expected to be more useful and accurate than computational
sequence-based methods is because the sequence-based approaches
do not take into consideration the chromatin state of the cell under a
speciﬁc experimental condition, cell type or organism. Hence, ChIP-
X databases and tools such as ChEA are expected to perform more
accurately when combined with data from mRNA gene expression

studies as compared to computational sequence based methods. A
match between a transcription factor and changes in gene expression
will be found not only by linking the changes in expression to
transcription factor binding sites, but also linking such binding
to a speciﬁc prior experiment which has been conducted under
similar condition. Combining different types of ChIP-X experiments
from different papers, cell-types and experimental conditions,
using different statistical cut-offs and experimental techniques is
challenging. We chose to either use the criteria applied by the authors
of each study, or apply our own standard method for ﬁnding peaks
and calling target genes. Both approaches are simple and relatively
unbiased. The two approaches complement each other in regards to
coverage. The raw data route excludes many of the studies currently
in the database since there are many ChIP-X publications that only
provide the target list without the raw data. There are also many
ChIP-X raw data ﬁles available in the public domain without a
publication that contains an author extracted gene list. Regardless,
we expect that the database will rapidly continue to grow. Moreover,
multiple entries for the same transcription factor can increase the
conﬁdence for functional binding sites (Wu and Ji, 2010). Our
initial analysis shows that overlap among different ChIP experiments
using the same factor increases functional gene predictability.
For example, we examined the overlap among independent Oct4
ChIP-X studies and compared the consensus overlapped genes
with an Oct4 knock-down followed by a microarray study. Initial
results demonstrate that ﬁinctional genes prediction improves when
multiple independent studies are combined, but this should be ﬁirther
investigated in ﬁiture studies. Since we keep track in our database on
information such as the cell type, organism, experimental method,
distance to start site and peak height, we implemented ﬁlters
that can be used by users to exclude the analysis from including
speciﬁc organism, cell-type or experimental method; as well as
calibrate the gene calling threshold for peak height and distance
to start site. For ﬁiture studies we plan to integrate ChIP-X data
with lost-of-ﬁinction/gain-of-function microarray studies as well as
include more histone modiﬁcation ChIP-X studies. Many of the
studies that report global transcription factor binding to DNA using
whole genome-wide ChIP-X experiments also often conduct global
mRNA experiments after knock-down or over-expression of the
transcription factors that were used in the ChIP-X studies, as well as
proﬁling speciﬁc histone modiﬁcations or polymerase binding using
ChIP-X technologies. By combining mRNA microarrays of RNA-
seq together with ChIP-X transcription factor, polymerase binding
and histone modiﬁcation studies, we can determine which binding
sites are functional, as well as which functional sites are activation
or inhibition sites. By combining expression data with ChIP-X we
should be able to obtain a signed and directed network which is
desired for understanding pathways, improving enrichment analyses
and performing dynamical simulations. The ChIP-X database and
ChEA web-based software tool was generated utilizing code from
our previous work of developing a kinase-substrate database and
software system for kinase enrichment analysis (KEA) (Lachmann
and Ma’ayan, 2009). These two software systems can potentially
be combined. Since we know the group of transcription factors
that regulate genes based on changes at the mRNA level under
a certain experimental condition or in a speciﬁc disease based
on tissue expression proﬁling, we can use known protein—protein
interactions to build a sub-network to connect these transcription
factors. Then, we can link this sub-network, as input for KEA, to

obtain the protein kinases and pathways that most likely regulate the
transcription factor centered sub-network (Bromberg et (11., 2008).
Such an approach can be used to understand cell regulation at the cell
signaling network level given mRNA expression proﬁling data and
suggest kinase inhibitors as drug-targets (Ma’ayan and He, 2010).

5 CONCLUSONS

In summary, the ChIP-X database and the ChEA software provide an
alternative way for researchers to analyze mRNA expression data in
context of genome-wide transcription-factor ChIP-X experiments
collected and organized into a prior knowledge database and
an interactive web-based software system. As more transcription
factors are proﬁled, under different experimental conditions, the
database is expected to grow and improve in accuracy and coverage.
Using other tools and databases in combination with ChEA,
integrative creative new applications in systems biology can be made
possible.

Abstract

Summary: Genotype imputation is now commonly performed following genome—wide genotyping
experiments. Imputation increases the density of analyzed genotypes in the dataset, enabling fine—
mapping across the genome. However, the process of imputation using the most recent publicly
available reference datasets can require considerable computation power and the management of
hundreds of large intermediate files. We have developed genipe, a complete genome—wide imput—
ation pipeline which includes automatic reporting, imputed data indexing and management, and a
suite of statistical tests for imputed data commonly used in genetic epidemiology (Sequence
Kernel Association Test, Cox proportional hazards for survival analysis, and linear mixed models
for repeated measurements in longitudinal studies).

1 Introduction

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are usually performed on
datasets containing over 1 million genetic markers. Those markers
are typed using high-throughput genotyping arrays that target a
small fraction of all possible genetic variants. Imputation is a low-
cost and popular statistical method to infer genotypic information at
up to 80 million known genetic variants (including single nucleotide
variants and insertions/deletions). Imputation is often used to boost
statistical power and it can be used to infer missing data and stand-
ardize variant sets for meta-analysis (Marchini et (11., 2010).

Large sequencing projects spanning multiple human populations
greatly increase the availability and quality of public imputation
panels, but the statistical methods needed for haplotype phasing and

imputation at the genome-wide level are computationally intensive.
In order to streamline this process, we have developed a genome-
wide imputation pipeline that automates all necessary computa-
tional steps including quality control and reporting while providing
support for high performance computing environments and statis-
tical tests for imputed data.

2 Methods
2.1 Main pipeline

The main pipeline uses three commonly used bioinformatics tools:
PLINK (Purcell et (11., 2007) for the initial genetics data manage-
ment, SHAPEIT (Delaneau et (11., 2012) for the loci strand

verification and the phasing step and IMPUTE2 (Howie et al., 2009)
for the imputation process. The genipe package orchestrates the
pipeline according to the best practices for genome—wide imputation
analysis (as described by SHAPEIT and IMPUTE2), and manages
the intermediate files created by the tools at the different stages.
The following steps are performed (most of them in parallel,
see Supplementary Table 51) in a typical imputation analysis with
genipe.

Quality metrics and statistics on the initial dataset are obtained,
including the missing call rate which is computed using PLINK for
all loci and all samples of the study dataset. Genetic loci from the
study panel are then filtered according to their genetic location and
allele composition. Starting from a binary ped file (PLINK format),
loci located on the Y and Mt chromosomes, or with ambiguous al—
leles (A/T or G/C) are filtered out of the dataset. At the same time, a
single version of a genetic marker is kept for downstream analysis
(i.e. duplicated variants). An optional strand check step can be per—
formed to ensure consistency between the human genome reference
and the microarray derived alleles. This means that the nucleotides
that are inconsistent with the reference will be complemented with
respect to the Watson Crick pairings. The reference strands of the
study data and that of the imputation reference panels are then com—
pared using SHAPEIT and inconsistent loci are flipped. A second
and last strand verification is performed and the remaining loci that
are discordant with the imputation reference are excluded from the
dataset.

The remaining markers are phased in parallel for each chromo—
some using SHAPEIT. The phasing tool allows for multiple threads
to run concurrently for each chromosome, increasing the speed of
the analysis.

Finally, IMPUTE2 is used to perform genome—wide imputation.
Each chromosome is split into segments of 5 Mb (by default) for the
imputation process in accordance with the segment size limitation of
the IMPUTE2 program. For each segment, IMPUTE2 produces
cross validation metrics, where a subset of genotyped loci are
masked, imputed and compared to their expected value. The genipe
package aggregates those statistics at a chromosomal and genomic
level using a weighted arithmetic mean.

Results for all segments are merged to produce one result file per
chromosome. Multiple companion files, including important infor—
mation such as minor allele frequency and information value
(INFO) are also included. The merged IMPUTE2 results file can op—
tionally be compressed using BGZIP, a variant of GZIP that allows
indexing.

The pipeline can be run on a desktop computer or on a DRMAA
compliant high—performance computing server. The phasing and im—
putation steps are customizable to fit any study design. A database
keeps track of all executed steps and enables post—failure relaunch of
the pipeline where it last stopped, saving processing time and re—
sources. At completion, a LATEX report containing important im—
putation quality metrics and processing times is automatically
created.

2.2 Output file management

Given the high number of variants imputed using a genome—wide ap—
proach, file management becomes a computational challenge that
needs to be addressed. To facilitate this task, we have developed the
imputeZ-extmctor utility that uses file indexing to accelerate extrac—
tion of variants from IMPUTE2 files by name or by genomic region.
Allele frequency filtering as well as quality control thresholds based
on the completion rate, the INFO field and the imputation

probability can also be specified. This script can be used as a stand—
alone utility and is automatically installed and added to the system
path after setting up genipe.

2.3 Statistical analysis

Bindings for linear and logistic regression using the statsmodels
package (Seabold et al., 2010) are included for common variant as—
sociation testing with continuous and discrete outcomes. Other
more sophisticated models, which were not previously available for
dosage data in an efficient tool, now have bindings with genipe.
These include the Cox proportional hazards model (lifelines pack—
age) which had no suitable implementations for pharmacogenomics
GWAS (Syed et al., 2016), an optimization (Sikorska et al., 2015) of
the linear mixed model for repeated measurements (statsmodels
package, see Supplementary Figs S2 and S3), and the Sequence
Kernel Association Test [SKAT R package (Ionita-Laza et al.,
2013)]. All these tests are now available for dosage data through the
companion script imputed-stats. See Supplementary Figure 51 for
execution times for the different models.

3 Application

The pipeline’s documentation provides a typical imputation analysis
tutorial along with required files. Those files includes a dataset of
2 278 357 markers genotyped on 90 HapMap samples. Using the
1000 Genomes Phase 3 reference panels, the dataset was imputed on
two different systems: a computing server (10 nodes of 8 Intel®
Xeon® E5620 CPUs 2.40 GHz, 48G of RAM per node) using the
DRMAA API for automatic task submission and a desktop com—
puter (Intel® CoreTM 17—3770 CPU 3.40 GHz, 16G of RAM). Using
a maximum of 50 simultaneous tasks, the pipeline took a total of
4.25 h on the computing server (including a waiting period of 0.08 h
in queue). Using a maximum of four simultaneous tasks, the pipeline
took 10.62 h to complete on the desktop computer.

4 Conclusion

Although online imputation pipeline exists (e.g. the Michigan
Imputation Server that uses Minimac3; https://imputationserver.sph.
umich.edu/ and the Sanger Imputation Service that uses PBWT;
https://imputation.sanger.ac.uk/), genipe is advantageous for the
users who cannot upload genotypic data on an off—site server for eth—
ical or legal restrictions. Also, as public servers gain in popularity,
the high workload can add significant time to the imputation ana—
lysis (queue time). The genipe pipeline can be efficiently executed on
a local high—performance computing server or on a single desktop
computer.

Finally, genipe provides a unified interface to statistical analysis
packages that did not have existing tools to automate the use of dos—
age data (e.g. linear mixed models from statsmodels, Cox propor—
tional hazards from lifelines and SKAT).

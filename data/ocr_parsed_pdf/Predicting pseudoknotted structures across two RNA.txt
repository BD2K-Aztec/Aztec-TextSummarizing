likelihood ﬁtting of a distribution to the histogram of a large sample of
random base pair similarity scores. The maximum likelihood ﬁtting was
performed using the ismev package of the R statistical language for a
range of stem lengths (see Supplementary Material). The P-value is
deﬁned as the probability to obtain a score greater than or equal to the
observed score strictly by chance. A stem s,(x) in sequence Seq” and a
stem S/(X) in sequence Seq” are a signiﬁcant pair if the score sim[s,(x), 3101)]
has an estimated P-value less than at. Stem pairs with a P-value larger
than at are not considered in the following.

3.2 Base pair similarity scores of interrupted stems

For two interrupted stems, the base pair similarity score is calculated by
deleting bulges and internal loops and scoring stems as consecutive base
pairs. Base pair similarity scores for regular and interrupted stems are
also calculated if the difference in number of base pairs is less than 5.
For example, a stem with one bulge might be a conserved match with a
regular stem. A stem s,(x) in sequence Seq” and a stem 310/) in sequence
Seq” are a signiﬁcant pair if the score sim[s,(x), 3101)] has an estimated
P-value less than at.

3.3 Base pair similarity scores of multiloops

Calculating the base pair similarity score for two multiloop structures
is complex due to the variety of inner loop elements, which may be regu-
lar or interrupted stems. A multiloop stx) can be decomposed into an
outer stem 3:9(X) and a set of inner structure elements S,(X)=[S1(X),. . .,
sk(x)], where k z 2. The base pair similarity score sim[s§?(x), SJ‘?(y)] for the
outer stems of two multi-loops can be easily obtained from the previously
calculated base pair similarity scores. If the outer stem is a conserved
match, a local alignment on the set of inner structure elements is used
to ﬁnd the base pair similarity score. Here, gaps are allowed in the local
alignment of inner structure elements; however, no gap penalty is used.
Let two sets of inner structure elements 5,-(X): [S1(X),. . ., 3,,(X)] and
S101): [3101), . ., sm(y)] be given. Let H(i, j) be the maximum similarity
score between a sufﬁx of S,(X) and a sufﬁx of 5/01). The optimal local
alignment is calculated as follows:

H(i,0)=0,0SiS"
H(0,j)=0,0§j§m

0
H(i — l,j)
H(i — l,j — l) + Sim[s,»(x),sj(y)]
HUJ - 1)

H(i, j) = max

A multiloop stx) in sequence Seq” and a multiloop SJMQJ) in sequence
Seq” are a signiﬁcant pair if the similarity score sim[s;.‘4(x),s}"(y)] has
an estimated P-value less than at.

3.4 Base pair similarity scores of H-type pseudoknots

A H-type pseudoknot has two pseudoknot stems S 1 and $2. The pre-
requisite for a conserved pseudoknot pair is that both core H-type pseu-
doknot stem pairs [S 1(X), $101)] and [SZ(X), 5201)] are signiﬁcant. The base
pair similarity score for two H-type pseudoknots 17,-(X) and 17,01) in
sequences Seq” and Seq”, respectively, is the sum of base pair similarity
scores for the core pseudoknot stems as well as the base pair similarity
score from a gapped local alignment of the recursive secondary structure
elements in the loops (as described for multiloops). A pseudoknot p,(x)
in sequence Seq” and a pseudoknot 17,01) in sequence Seq” are a signiﬁcant
pseudoknot pair if the similarity score sim[p,(x), 17/01)] has an estimated
P-value less than at.

3.5 Dissimilarity and weight of signiﬁcant structure
elements pairs

The base pair similarity score calculated in the previous sections might
not be powerful enough to distinguish true positive conserved structure
element pairs from false-positive structure element pairs due to the ﬁnite
lengths of stems and exclusion of loop sequences in the alignment.
Therefore, a dissimilarity score is also used to conﬁrm whether a pair
is signiﬁcant. The dissimilarity for two given structure elements s,(x) and
310/) in sequences Seq” and Seq” is defined as:

dissim[si(x),sj(y)] = Z dissimk[si(x), 51-01)]

k:l.....2

where dissiml is the difference in the stem lengths and dissimz is the
difference in the number of loop lengths. As an example, consider the
pseudoknot pair p1(x) and 1710/) in sequences Seq” and Seq”, respectively,
with stems S 1, $2 and loops L1, L2, L3. The pseudoknot pair has dissimi-
larity of 6.

A weight is assigned to a signiﬁcant pair, which is a combination of
the free energy, covariation and dissimilarity. The overall weight 3 of
a signiﬁcant structure element pair [.S‘,(X), s,{y)] in sequences Seq” and
Seq” is a combination of the free energy weights w[s,(x)] and w[s/(y)],
base pair similarity score sim[si(x), s,(y)] and dissimilarity dissim[s,-(X),

Only structure element pairs with positive score 3 are allowed in the
following dynamic programming algorithm. Here, at and y are set to
0.5 and ﬂ is set to l.

3.6 Finding best set of signiﬁcant structure elements

Let p”, . . . ,pﬁ,‘ be the number of structure elements in the ﬁrst sequence
Seq” and 17;”, ..., 17;, be the number of structure elements in the second
sequence Seq”. Each structure element has a left and right endpoint in the
sequence and is a stem, interrupted stem, multiloop or H-type pseudo-
knot. Structure elements can also be represented as nodes in a graph.
In each sequence, the structure elements are ordered by their right end-
points. An edge is drawn between two structure elements in the ﬁrst and
the second sequence if their base pair similarity score has a P-value less
than at. Given the set of edges between nodes pf, . . . ,pﬁ,‘ and 17'}, . . . , 17;},
the goal is to ﬁnd the set of edges with maximum weight that are
non-crossing. This relates to ﬁnding the set of non-overlapping structure
elements in the two sequences that maximize the score under the require-
ment that the interval ordering is preserved. A set of structure elements in
the ﬁrst and second sequence, which preserves the interval ordering is
called a feasible structure element alignment and must satisfy the follow-
ing two requirements. Each structure element can be aligned with at most
one other structure element in the other sequence. The order of structure
elements must be preserved with respect to the alignment. That is, if
structure elements 17? and p!” in the ﬁrst sequence are aligned with p;
and in the second sequence, respectively, the pairs may never overlap:
pl” <17!” Apj <12; (Fig. 2).

Given nodes 173' . . . ,pﬁ,‘ in the ﬁrst sequence Seq” and 17;”, . . . , 17;, in the
second sequence Seq”, let ﬂi, a) be the maximum sum of edge weights for
nodes between 1 and i in the ﬁrst sequence and l and a in the second
sequence such that the edges are non-crossing (fin and aim). The
nodes that maximize the sum of edge weights are called an optimal

Fig. 2. A set of edges with positive scores is given between nodes 171,. . .,p7
in the ﬁrst sequence and p1,. . .,p6 in the second sequence. The goal is to
ﬁnd the best set of non-overlapping structure elements in the two se-
quences such that the interval ordering is preserved. The optimal struc-
ture element alignment, which preserves the interval ordering includes
structure elements 171, 174, 177 in the first sequence and 171, 174, 176 in the
second sequence

structure element alignment for the two sequences. The optimal structure
element alignment is calculated using dynamic programming. For a given
structure element 17,- with start point a,- and end point bi, let pre(i) be the
non-overlapping predecessor. For each structure element, its predecessor
is pre-computed using the sorted list of structure elements. The recursion
for calculating the optimal structure element alignment is as follows:

f (0, a) = 0

f (i, 0) = 0
f (i — 1, a)

f (i, a) = max 3(1', a) + f [pre(i), pre(a)]
f (i, a — 1)

Furthermore, nested structures are taken into account for signiﬁcant
outer stem pairs, which have estimated P-value less than or. For each
signiﬁcant outer hairpin loop pair, the optimal structure element align-
ment of inner elements is computed.

3.7 Time requirements

For two unaligned RNA sequences Seq” and Seq”, the single sequence
prediction method DotKnot returns structure element dictionaries
derived from the probability dot plot. Let n and m be the number of
structure elements in sequences Seq” and Seq”, respectively. Calculating
the similarity scores and the optimal structure element alignment takes
0(nm) time. Furthermore, nested structures are taken into account
for signiﬁcant outer stem pairs, which have estimated P-value less
than 0;. Let a be the number of signiﬁcant stem pairs, where both
stems are hairpin loops. For each signiﬁcant outer hairpin loop pair,
the optimal structure alignment of inner elements is computed. In the
worst case, this increases time requirements to 0(a >< nm). The number of
structure elements depends on the base composition of the sequence.
Empirically, n and m can be observed to grow linearly with the length
of the sequence for uniform base distribution (see Supplementary
Material). In practice, DotKnot—PW can be expected to run in the
order of minutes for sequences shorter than 500 nt.

4 RESULTS

Many pseudoknot prediction programs have been evaluated
using all the entries in the PseudoBase database (van
Batenburg et al., 2000). There are several caveats in this
approach. First, the sequences given in PseudoBase are those
which exactly harbor the pseudoknot. However, in practice
structure prediction algorithms will be applied to longer

sequences without prior knowledge of the pseudoknot location.
Second, long—range pseudoknot entries appear in a truncated
version in the database. Third, some classes of pseudoknots
have a large number of entries (such as short H—type pseudo—
knots in the 3’—untranslated regions of plant viruses), whereas
more complex types of pseudoknots only have one representative
(such as long—range rRNA pseudoknots). Therefore, a
hand—curated dataset of pseudoknot structures will be used here.

When it comes to pseudoknots, many structures have been
published based on a secondary structure predicted by free
energy minimization. These predicted secondary structures are
used as a working model and reﬁned using experimental tech—
niques such as chemical and enzymatic probing. However, the
native structure remains unsolved unless tertiary structure deter—
mination methods such as X—ray crystallography are used.
Testing structures that are based on computer predictions with
no experimental support creates a bias in the benchmark and will
be avoided in this evaluation.

A total of 16 pseudoknotted reference structures from differ—
ent RNA types were collected, which have strong experimental
support. For each reference structure, a supporting set of 10
evolutionarily related sequences was obtained from the RFAM
database (Gardner et al., 2010). Note that for the vast majority
of supporting sequences, no experimentally determined struc—
tures are available. The average pairwise sequence identities
vary from 55% to 99%. Given a reference structure, the per—
formance of prediction algorithms is evaluated in terms of sen—
sitivity (S), i.e. the percentage of base pairs in the reference
structure, which are predicted correctly, as well as positive pre—
dictive value (PPV), i.e. the percentage of predicted pairs, which
are in the reference structure. The Matthews correlation coeffi—
cient (MCC) is also reported and is in the range from —1 to l,
where 1 corresponds to a perfect prediction and —1 to a predic—
tion that is in total disagreement with the reference structure.
The performance of each method for predicting the reference
structure was evaluated as described in Gardner and Giegerich
(2004).

DotKnot—PW was compared with methods that are freely
available and use standard input and output formats. The com—
parative methods are CARNAC, Tfold and hxmatch (with the —
A option using RNAalifold). All of these methods return
structure predictions for only the reference structure with regards
to the support set of evolutionarily related sequences. Tfold and
hxmatch take a sequence alignment as the input. Clustalw
with the default parameters was used to produce the initial
sequence alignment. Do tKnot—PW and CARNAC take a set of un—
aligned sequences as the input. Furthermore, prediction results
for the reference sequence (not the supporting sequences) were
obtained from the single sequence methods DotKnot
(Sperschneider and Datta, 2010; Sperschneider et al., 2011),
ProbKnot (Bellaousov and Mathews, 2010), IPknot (Sato
et al., 2011) and RNAfold (Hofacker et al., 1994). Note that
all methods except CARNAC and RNAfold allow pseudoknot
prediction.

The results are shown in Table 1. DotKnot—PW has the high—
est average MCC of 0.75 for the test sequences. For each
reference structure with the 10 support sequences from the
corresponding RFAM family, 10 predictions are returned ordered
by the combined free energy and similarity score. If only the

Note: Each reference structure is given by its ID (see Supplementary Material for dot—bracket notation). The following column gives the method of experimental support (NMR, NMR spectroscopy; X—ray, X—ray

pairwise prediction with highest combined free energy and simi—
larity score is taken, DotKnot—PW has an improved average
MCC of 0.81. Tfold and hxmatch have average MCC of 0.6
and 0.59, respectively. CARNAC has average MCC of 0.45 with
much higher average speciﬁcity than sensitivity.

The prediction results for single sequence structure prediction
for each of the reference sequences with experimentally deter—
mined structures are also shown in Table 1. Note that this
does not include the prediction for the support sequences from
RFAM, as no experimentally determined structures are available.
All single sequence pseudoknot prediction methods show im—
proved results over using RNAfold. DotKnot has the highest
average MCC of 0.76, followed by IPKnot and ProbKnot.

As an example, consider the S15 mRNA pseudoknot that
binds to speciﬁc proteins in the autoregulation mechanism of
ribosomal protein S15 synthesis (Philippe et al., 1995). For the
reference sequence S15 and 10 support sequences from the cor—
responding RFAM family, DotKnot—PW returns pairwise predic—
tions ordered by the combined free energy and similarity score.
The top two pairwise predictions with the highest scores are
shown in Figure 3.

5 DISCUSSION

We presented DotKnot—PW for prediction of structures
common to two RNA sequences, including H—type pseudoknots.
Both DotKnot and DotKnot—PW have been designed as dedi—
cated pseudoknot prediction tools. In the following, important
aspects of pseudoknot prediction will be discussed.

5.1 The underlying folding model

Single sequence prediction methods are always limited by the
underlying RNA folding model. This may be the set of free
energy parameters used by free energy minimization methods
or the underlying methodological framework such as maximum
expected accuracy methods. DotKnot—PW shows excellent re—
sults on H—type pseudoknots with short interhelix loops.
For this type of pseudoknots, DotKnot—PW uses free energy
pseudoknot parameters by Cao and Chen (2006, 2009) based
on polymer statistical mechanics. Improvements of the accuracy
of free energy parameters, both for secondary structures and
pseudoknots, will lead to more accurate prediction methods.
However, one has to keep in mind that the algorithms themselves
must be designed in such a fashion that novel parameters can be
efﬁciently incorporated. The heuristic framework of DotKnot—
PW has been designed such that it can incorporate sophisticated
free energy parameters for pseudoknots, secondary structures
and coaxial stacking. In the future, DotKnot—PW could also
use contributions from basic tertiary structure elements such
as base triples around the pseudoknot junction or stem—loop
interactions.

5.2 The type of pseudoknot

Pseudoknot prediction algorithms come in two ﬂavors: either
they can predict a certain, restricted class of pseudoknots or
they do not have a restriction on the type of pseudoknot that
can be predicted. For methods using free energy parameters, the
inclusion of general types of pseudoknots might be more of a

curse than a blessing, as no reliable free energy parameters for
complex pseudoknots are available. DotKnot—PW has restric—
tions on the type of pseudoknot that can be predicted.
However, this does not always lead to poor prediction results
in practice. For example, DotKnot—PW shows the best result
for the HDV ribozyme, which is a complex double nested
pseudoknot.

5.3 The trouble with benchmarking

The results from the benchmark for structure prediction in
Table 1 must be interpreted with care. First, the tested methods
can be run with different parameters, possibly producing better
results. However, as a typical user has no prior knowledge about
the structure, the default parameters for each method are used.
Of course, a comprehensive benchmark should include a larger
number of structures to obtain a more reliable evaluation.
However, in this study, the focus has been on a test set where
the structures are supported experimentally. Many structures
have been published, which were determined using computa—
tional tools and this will inevitably create a bias in a benchmark,
and thus they were excluded here.

5.4 Gaining conﬁdence with multiple sequences

Here, an extension of the single sequence prediction method
DotKnot was presented based on the pairwise comparison of
structure elements. This approach called DotKnot—PW is
designed as an algorithm for ﬁnding the structure including
H—type pseudoknots common to two sequences. As shown in
Table 1, Do tKnot—PW can greatly improve structure predictions
for RNA families when compared with the single sequence pre—
diction using DotKnot. In some cases, a comparative approach
might have lower sensitivity than a single sequence prediction;
however, this should not generally be judged as ‘inferior’. For
example, ncRNAs might preserve some integral base pairs
throughout evolution and only these will be detected by a com—
parative approach, which returns the set of base pairs common
to a set of evolutionarily related sequences. DotKnot—PW uses
a set of unaligned sequences as the input; therefore, no expert
user intervention is required. In the future, DotKnot—PW will
be extended to include intramolecular kissing hairpins.
Furthermore, constrained folding will be implemented to predict

a structure subject to constraints, e. g. enforce certain base pairs
or regions, which must remain unpaired.

6 CONCLUSION

Do tKnot—PW has been designed as a dedicated pseudoknot pre—
diction tool and should be applied to RNA sequences where
pseudoknotted interactions are suspected in the structures.
Prediction accuracy will inevitably decrease for sequences,
which are longer than say 400 nt for any single sequence struc—
ture prediction method (Reeder et al., 2006). To achieve reliable
results, short sequences should be folded using DotKnot and
predictions should be compared with results from other methods
from the literature. To gain conﬁdence in predictions, subsequent
comparative prediction using DotKnot—PW and other compara—
tive methods is highly recommended. Ideally, experimental veri—
fication of computationally predicted pseudoknots should be
sought.

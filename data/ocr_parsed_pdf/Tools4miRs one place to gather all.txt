Abstract

Summary: MiRNAs are short, non—coding molecules that negatively regulate gene expression and
thereby play several important roles in living organisms. Dozens of computational methods for
miRNA—related research have been developed, which greatly differ in various aspects. The substan—
tial availability of difficult—to—compare approaches makes it challenging for the user to select a
proper tool and prompts the need for a solution that will collect and categorize all the methods.
Here, we present tools4miRs, the first platform that gathers currently more than 160 methods for
broadly defined miRNA analysis. The collected tools are classified into several general and more
detailed categories in which the users can additionally filter the available methods according to
their specific research needs, capabilities and preferences. Tools4miRs is also a web—based target
prediction meta—server that incorporates user—designated target prediction methods into the ana—
lysis of user—provided data.

Availability and Implementation: Tools4miRs is implemented in Python using Django and is freely

 

available at tools4mirs.org.

1 Introduction

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short (18—24nt), non-coding
and single-stranded RNAs that mediate the post-transcriptional
gene expression regulation by promoting the cleavage or inhibiting
the translation of the target mRNA (Djuranovic et (11., 2012; Hu and
Coller, 2012). Throughout their mechanism, miRNAs control the
cell development, apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation and sev-
eral other essential functions in living organisms (Wienholds and
Plasterk, 2005; Zhang et (11., 2007).

Great contributions to the current knowledge concerning
miRNAs’ properties and functions came not only from the develop-
ment of several experimental techniques but also from computational
analytical approaches, which are nowadays considered to be an al-
most indispensable part of any basic or applied miRNA-related re-
search (van Rooij, 2011; Ying, 2013). The available bioinformatics

methods and resources cover an impressive scope—from miRNAs
identification, through the prediction of their precursors and targets,
the elucidation of miRNAs functions, to databases gathering various
relevant biological information (Akhtar et (11., 2016; Liu et (11., 2014).
In addition to the implementation and organism specificity, the afore-
mentioned tools differ primarily in their methodology, the features
considered in the analysis and, consequently, their performance. New
methods are being constantly developed, improved and published
along with several useful review papers, which provide a description
and evaluation of these up-to-date computational approaches (Akhtar
et (11., 2016; Kang and Friedlander, 2015; Kleftogiannis et (11., 2013).
Nevertheless, in this multitude of possibilities and features, reviewing
several articles or websites may still be insufficient to choose a desired
method. Hence, there is a need for a place that collects and categorizes
all the available tools.

To address this need, tools4miRs, a user—friendly, manually cura—
ted and filterable service that gathers methods for miRNA analyses,
was developed. In miRNA—related research, considerable import—
ance is attached to miRNA target identification, which reflects the
function of the miRNA in the cell. Therefore, tools4miRs also en—
ables the prediction of miRNA targets using methods previously se—
lected by the user.

2 Data content and organization

Throughout a comprehensive survey of the scientific literature and
information available in public websites/services, data concerning
over 160 tools for varied miRNA analyses were gathered.
Furthermore, the methods were categorized into four general groups
(Sequencing Data Analysis, All—In—One Tools, Databases and Other
Tools) and seven more detailed sections: Known miRNA
Identification, isomiRs Identification, Novel miRNA/Precursor
Analysis, Differential Expression Analysis, Target Prediction, Target
Functional Analysis and miRNA—SNP Analysis. The classification of
certain collected tools may be redundant, i.e. depending on their
functionality and required NGS input data, they may be assigned to
several categories. Such categorization would aid the user in recog—
nizing the methods they should consider with their data and their
exact research question. The manually verified information with re—
gard to the tools included in the tools4miRs and the content of cur—
rently available sections are described in detail in the Supplementary
Data. All the gathered computational approaches are presented in
legible tables that provide, at first glance, basic information concern—
ing each method. Through the ‘Filter Panel’, the user can addition—
ally filter the available tools according to even more specific and
appropriate criteria, e.g. analysis/prediction features, collected data,
organism—specificity, tool availability, reference genome/NGS data
requirement and sequencing platform specificity. Clicking on the
tool name leads to its extensive description, where the user can find
information regarding the algorithm, ease of use/install, user adjust—
ability, performance, last software update, user support availability,
cross—references, license, analysis schemes and others. A simple ex—
ample about how to find the desired tool using tools4miRs can be
found in the Supplementary Data.

3 Target prediction meta-server

The functions of miRNAs in living organisms are associated with
their binding to target mRNAs. Therefore, selecting and annotat—
ing potential miRNA targets are the first steps for determining the
role of a miRNA in the cell. To facilitate this process, tools4miRs
provides a web—based miRNA target prediction meta—server that
incorporates into the analysis a suit of methods tailored by the
user. Currently, the meta—server integrates 10 methods presented
in a filterable table. After choosing the tools, the user is asked to
provide the target mRNA and miRNA sequences as well as, op-
tionally, the job name, description and e—mail address for further
retrieving the calculated results. The parameters available for most
of the methods can be additionally set. The possibility to submit
any sequences of miRNAs and potential targets is an advantage of
the tools4miRs meta—server over other currently available servers,
which are usually implemented on a limited number of species or
work on build—in databases and forces the user to select miRNA/
targets from the available list of molecules. The predictions gener—
ated by the described meta—server can be presented in basic or ex-
tended mode. The basic mode shows individual miRNA:target

pairs, along with the number of binding sites in a given target,
checkmarks by the appropriate tool names and the total number of
tools that predicted the given pair. In the extended analysis mode,
the obtained predictions are grouped by unique triplets—binding
site location, miRNA and target mRNA. Thus, the exact ‘from:to’
position in the target sequence and the total number of tools that
predicted this specific site are given. Additionally, information
concerning score, energy or other values calculated by the chosen
approaches are provided. The ‘Union’, ‘Consensus’ and
‘Intersection’ of the used tools are available after the target predic—
tion table is generated. The ‘Consensus’ mode returns only unique
miRNA—target pairs or unique miRNA—target binding sites, pre—
dicted by minimum X of used tools, where X is number set by the
user. After the target prediction table generation, the user is also
able to sort and filter the obtained results, e.g. by dismissing/forc—
ing the display of the targets predicted by the chosen method. All
the results may be downloaded in CSV, XLS or XLSX format.
MiRNA target prediction workflow using the tools4miRs meta—
server can be found in the Supplementary Data.

4 Implementation and availability

Tools4miRs is freely available at www.tools4mirs.org and is in—
tended to be systematically maintained. No registration is needed to
exploit its full functionality. Researchers interested in adding their
published method are encouraged to submit it through the ‘Submit
Tool’ form. Tools4miRs is implemented in Python using the Django
framework for the web—based frontend. Backend calculations and
distributed computing are also governed by Python using common
API for all the implemented software. A detailed description of the
tools4miRs implementation can be found in the Supplementary
Data.

5 Conclusions

Currently, to choose an appropriate in silico approach for miRNA
research, it is necessary to search through a large amount of litera—
ture or existing on—line resources. Here, we describe tools4miRs —
the first open—access platform that gathers over 160 tools dedicated
for broad miRNA analysis. The presented service is also a web—
based miRNA target prediction meta—server that enables the user to
perform an analysis using only the desired tools. Tools4miRs is use—
ful not only for bioinformaticians but also for experimental scien—
tists in basic or applied miRNA research.

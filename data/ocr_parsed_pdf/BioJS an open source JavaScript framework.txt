ABSTRACT

Summary: BioJS is an open-source project whose main objective is
the visualization of biological data in JavaScript. BioJS provides an
easy-to-use consistent framework for bioinformatics application pro-
grammers. It follows a community-driven standard speciﬁcation that
includes a collection of components purposely designed to require a
very simple configuration and installation. In addition to the program-
ming framework, BioJS provides a centralized repository of compo-
nents available for reutilization by the bioinformatics community.
Availability and implementation: http://code.google.com/p/biojs/.

Bioinformatics online.

1 INTRODUCTION

Numerous web applications exist for the Visualization and inte-
gration of biological data. Biological data can be complex and
heterogeneous, making it challenging to integrate and Visualize
results in web applications. JavaScript is a popular language for
developing Rich Internet Applications (RIA); most RIA rely on
JavaScript libraries for deployment of functionality. Despite its
widespread use in bioinformatics, J avaScript applications are usu-
ally implemented to satisfy a particular utility, ignoring its poten-
tial for reutilization by other applications with similar purposes.

Here, we present BioJS, an open source community-driven
JavaScript framework of reusable graphical components. BioJS
offers a set of standard guidelines on how to develop components
for JavaScript modules in the Life Sciences. These guidelines
make installation and addition of new code the same for

all new components, minimizing effort and encouraging good
programming practice.

BioJS provides a catalogue of open source modules
in JavaScript for Life Sciences. These modules include many
commonly used functionalities, available there for developers
or scientists to download. BioJ S embraces a similar philosophy to
previously successful biologically oriented open source projects,
such as BioPerl (Stajich et al., 2002), BioJava (Prlic et al., 2012),
BioPython (Cock et al., 2009) or BioRuby (Goto et al., 2010),
advocating that any functional component or module should be
developed only once and reused whenever possible. Our ap-
proach offers a standard and scalable set of speciﬁcations to
produce custom applications; it also facilitates the integration
of components into more comprehensive web applications. To
our knowledge, no community efforts have so far achieved a
coordinated development of JavaScript applications for the
Visual representation of biological data.

2 BIOJS COMPONENTS

At the time of writing, there are 29 components available and 18
registered contributors to the project. Table 1 lists a few example
components considered important and representative. BioJ S
components follow a standard speciﬁcation facilitating their in-
tegration in third party web applications. The BioJ S architecture
deﬁnes common events that make components capable of com-
municating and exchanging data (Fig. l). The project is serviced
by a registry that enables users to interact and discover existing
components. The registry periodically delivers documentation,
providing search functionalities for component discovery. When
a component is accessed from the registry (Fig. 2), its description
includes a functional example, a sample code of how to install it
and documentation on how to use dependencies, methods and
events. The development of a BioJS component might initially
take longer than developing the same module using an

independent JavaScript application, but this is only for as long as
the user familiarizes him/herself with the framework.

BioJS is framework agnostic, only requiring the code to be
written in JavaScript. The developer of a new component is
thus free to use any framework (e.g. JQuery, http://jquery.
com/; YUI, http://yuilibrary.com/) and to include any other li-
brary (Raphael, http://raphaeljs.com/; D3, http://d3js.org/). The
look and feel of a component can be easily conﬁgured using
Cascade Style Sheet (CSS) to enable its integration Via different
web applications. Any component by deﬁnition extends the
BioJ S reference implementation incorporating the rules provided
by the BioJS speciﬁcation: (i) the component architecture,
(ii) a protocol to handle events that allows communication
between components, (iii) the component extension through
Object-Oriented Inheritance, (iv) the code documentation
format and (V) documentation on how to include examples to

test the component functionality. We are aware of several bio-
informatics projects already using BioJS to Visualize data. For
instance, the CATH (Cuff et al., 2011) and the IntAct (Kerrien
et al., 2012) databases both use the Protein3D Viewer, an example
of the reutilization of an existing component. The Biotea Project
(Garcia-Castro et al., 2012) reuses and extends BioJ S components
to Visualize the biological data of PubMed Central articles.

3 CONCLUSIONS

BioJS provides a framework for development and sharing of
graphical components, implemented in JavaScript. Availability
of a central registry and a common set of guidelines facilitates
component discovery while reducing development time. We have
presented here some of BioJ S’s Visualization capabilities for sev-
eral biological applications, making use of existing components.
We anticipate BioJ S’s available functionality to grow steadily in
the near future. Our project will be successful in the measure in
which it reduces overall development time for new web applica-
tions requiring Visualization of biological data.

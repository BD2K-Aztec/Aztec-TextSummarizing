ABSTRACT

Motivation: Several cancer types consist of multiple genetically and
phenotypically distinct subpopulations. The underlying mechanism for
this intra-tumoral heterogeneity can be explained by the clonal evolu-
tion model, whereby growth advantageous mutations cause the
expansion of cancer cell subclones. The recurrent phenotype of
many cancers may be a consequence of these coexisting subpopula-
tions responding unequally to therapies. Methods to computationally
infer tumor evolution and subpopulation diversity are emerging and
they hold the promise to improve the understanding of genetic and
molecular determinants of recurrence.

Results: To address cellular subpopulation dynamics within human
tumors, we developed a bioinformatic method, EXPANDS. It estimates
the proportion of cells harboring specific mutations in a tumor. By
modeling cellular frequencies as probability distributions, EXPANDS
predicts mutations that accumulate in a cell before its clonal expansion.
We assessed the performance of EXPANDS on one whole genome
sequenced breast cancer and performed SP analyses on 1 18 glioblast-
oma multiforme samples obtained from TCGA. Our results inform about
the extent of subclonal diversity in primary glioblastoma, su bpopulation
dynamics during recurrence and provide a set of candidate genes
mutated in the most well-adapted subpopulations. In summary,
EXPANDS predicts tumor purity and subclonal composition from
sequencing data.

1 INTRODUCTION

The clonal evolution model initially proposed by Peter C. Nowell
posits that a single cell of origin or ‘clone’ that underwent
transformation from a normal to a cancerous state undergoes
clonal expansion and through successive acquisition of muta-
tions generates genetically diverse subclones (Nowell, 1976).
Subsequent pressure from the cancer microenvironment selects
the fittest subclone(s), driving their expansion into subpopula-
tions (SPs). As a consequence, the resulting neoplasm is com-
posed of multiple genetically diverse SPs that are best adapted to
their microenvironment.

Cancer therapies are hypothesized to eliminate some but not
all SPs within a tumor, resulting in altered SP composition of
tumors that recur post-treatment (Aktipis et al., 2011; Merlo
and Maley, 2010). A better understanding of the SP compos-
ition and dynamics of individual tumors is expected to have
significant clinical implications especially for highly recurrent
and therapy resistant tumors. Glioblastoma (GBM), a grade
IV astrocytoma, is the most common CNS tumor in adults.
Despite aggressive standard therapy, consisting of surgery, ra-
diation and adjuvant chemotherapy with the DNA alkylating
drug temozolomide (Stupp et al., 2009), GEM invariably recur
within months following initial diagnosis (Konishi et al., 2012)
and typically become resistant to the ﬁrst line therapy they have
been exposed (Fan et al., 2010; Lomonaco et al., 2009). An SP
with stem-like properties, the cancer stem cells, is one potential
culprit for recurrence and therapy resistance in GBM (Chen
et al., 2012; Schonberg et al., 2013). GEM exhibit substantial
subclonal diversity as evidenced by previous comparative gen-
omic hybridization (CGH) analyses (Harada et al., 1998), fluor-
escence in situ hybridization studies (Little et al., 2012; Snuderl
et al., 2011; Szerlip et al., 2012) and areal sampling of surgical
tissue followed by molecular analyses (Sottoriva et al., 2013).
Moreover, heterogeneity within GBM is maintained by cross-
talk between genetically distinct tumor cell SPs (Inda et al.,
2010). However, genome-wide analyses of intra-tumoral

heterogeneity and the clonal cellular SP dynamics within GBM
have yet to be performed.

Clonal architecture analyses as previously performed for acute
lymphoblastic leukemia single cells (Anderson et al., 2011; NaVin
et al., 2011) are difﬁcult to perform for solid tumors that are a
tight mix of distinct SPs and various fractions of non-neoplastic
cells. Knowing the purity of a tumor sample is important to
determine sample quality and to adjust parameters during
copy-number estimation and detection of somatic mutations.
The advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies
provide emerging tools for computational methods to overcome
those hurdles. ABSOLUTE for example is an analytic method
that predicts tumor purity and the distribution of mutations
within the tumor from exome sequencing data (Carter et al.,
2012). The inferences made by ABSOLUTE do not include the
number of tumor SPs and the size of each SP in the tumor bulk.
These are, however, desirable parameters when quantifying gen-
etic heterogeneity, an emerging biomarker for clinical outcome
(Merlo et al., 2010, Mroz et al., 2013).

Shah et a]. have developed another bioinformatic approach to
predict the number and distribution of subclones from deep-
sequenced selected mutated genes and to infer the clonal evolu-
tion of triple negative breast cancer (Shah et al., 2012). By this
method, two SPs with the same mutation in the region that was
deep sequenced would be indistinguishable even if greatly diver-
gent in other areas of the genome. This approach further relies
on prior knowledge or hypotheses regarding genes of interest and
does not allow for unbiased exploration of the cancer genome.

Nik-Zainal et a]. modeled the observed patterns of clonal and
subclonal mutations with a hierarchical Bayesian Dirichlet
process (Nik-Zainal et al., 2012). This approach was designed
speciﬁcally for the mutations detected in the whole genome
of a hypermutated breast cancer, sequenced at high coverage
(188-fold). The authors inferred a plethora of information
about the evolution and subclonal structure of this cancer
genome by using various ways to look at the data as described
in Nik-Zainal et a]. (2012), yet their combined approaches are
not available as one automated method.

The resolution of the aforementioned approaches increases
with depth of coverage. We propose that the accuracy in the
identification of SPs is dependent not only on depth of coverage
but also on breadth of coverage, i.e. the fraction of nucleotides in
the genome sampled by the assay. Here we intend to complement
existing methods by pairing an unbiased genome-wide sequen-
cing approach with a robust analytic algorithm.

We present Qpandjng Ploidy and Allele-frequency on Nested
Subpopulations (EXPANDS), a method that characterizes coex-
isting SPs in a tumor using copy number and allele frequencies
derived from exome- or whole genome sequencing input data.
The model ampliﬁes the statistical power to detect coexisting
genotypes, by fully exploiting run-speciﬁc tradeoffs between
depth of coverage and breadth of coverage. Our results indicate
that EXPANDS is superior to ABSOLUTE in predicting tumor
purity of highly heterogeneous tumor samples. In addition to
tumor purity, EXPANDS predicts the number of clonal expan-
sions, the size of the resulting SPs in the tumor bulk and the
mutations speciﬁc to each SP. This information can be useful
to identify candidate gene regulators of tumor growth and
recurrence.

The article outline is as follows: in Section 2.1722, we formu-
late the problem and describe the EXPANDS model. Section 2.3
describes the performance of EXPANDS on a simulated dataset,
data obtained from one previously published whole genome
sequenced breast cancer case and 118 TCGA GBM exome-
sequenced samples. Section 3 shows how our approach results
inform about SP composition in primary GBM and SP changes
on recurrence and what genes are mutated in the most well-
adapted SPs. Finally, in Section 4, we discuss limitations to
our method and propose future directions for the approach of
tumor mixture separation.

2 SYSTEM AND METHODS

2.1 Problem formulation

Given a set of somatic point mutations, SN Vg‘gnng’t'ic, detected in a
tumor sample and the copy number of the genomic segments in
which the mutations are located, we aim to identify the number
N of clonal expansions within the tumor, the relative size f,- of the
resulting SPs in the tumor bulk and the mutations habitant in
each SP,-, 1‘: {1. . .N}. We assume that both, technical artifacts
(sequencing errors, mapping errors) and germline polymorph-
isms, have been adequately ﬁltered. First, we identify the
number and size of SPs. Finally, we assign each
snv 6 SN to an SP, SPi. The set of somatic mutations
can be extended to contain loss of heterozygosity (LOH) sites
for which the non-reference allele is overrepresented in the cancer
cell relative to a normal cell. For tumors with a low number of
somatic point mutations, the inclusion of LOH sites can provide
a sufﬁcient number of somatic events for the subsequent

procedure.

2.2 EXPANDS model

Tumor cells acquire novel mutations that distinguish them from
other cells within the same tumor. With respect to the whole
genome, there is no limit to how diverse a tumor cell population
can become. However, with respect to a specific locus I, only a
limited number of possible states exist, each characterized by
Pfithe ploidy of the non-reference allele (B allele) and Plithe
total ploidy of locus 1. Given the stochastic nature of somatic
events and the size of the human genome, it is unlikely that two
independent driver-events of the same type will target the same
genomic position in two different cells. Therefore, we assume
that no more than two distinct cell types exist with respect to a
speciﬁc locus [2 cells in which the locus is in its mutated state
and cells in which the locus is in its normal state, further
denoted mutated cells and normal cells, respectively.
Furthermore, we assume that multiple passenger mutations ac-
cumulate in a cell before a driver mutation causes a clonal
expansion and thus, that each clonal expansion is marked by
multiple mutations. These two assumptions are translated into
the EXPANDS model in four main steps: cell frequency esti-
mation, clustering, ﬁltering and assignment of mutations to
clusters (Fig. 1).

2.2.] Cell frequency estimation We consider two types of mo-
lecular mechanisms that convert a locus into its mutated state:
copy number variation (CNV) inducing events and single

Fig. 1. Graphical summary of the four major steps (A—D) of EXPANDS. Given a set of SNVs, EXPANDS predicts the number of clonal expansions in a
tumor, the size of the resulting SPs in the tumor bulk and which SNVs accumulate in a cell before its clonal expansion. The copy number and allele
frequency assigned to a SNV are measures of aggregate signals from many cells. (A) Cell frequency estimation. EXPANDS combines these two
measurements to estimate what fraction of cells harbor the SNV. In this example, the observed AF (0.3) and copy number (2.1) can be explained
either by a homozygous mutation, present in 30% of the cells or a heterozygous mutation, present in 60% of the cells. The cell-frequency probability P(f)
is computed for each mutated locus separately. (B) Clustering. All SNVs are clustered based on their cell-frequency probability distributions. Each cluster
is extended by members with similar distributions in an interval around the cluster-maxima. (C) Filtering. Clusters are pruned based on statistics within
and outside the core region (interval around the cluster-maxima: highlighted in red). The blue cluster is pruned as peaks within the core region are low
and do not signiﬁcantly exceed peaks observed outside the core region. In contrast, the green cluster is kept as it has high and abundant peaks within and
only a few peaks outside the core region. The number of remaining clusters denotes the number of predicted clonal expansions. Cell frequencies at
cluster-maxima denote the predicted size of an SP in the tumor bulk. (D) Assignment of SNVs to clusters. Each SNV is assigned to one of the predicted
clonal expansions, based on the cell frequency estimation computed in (A)

nucleotide variation (SNV) inducing events. We assume that a
normal state is deﬁned by a total ploidy of two and B allele
ploidy below two, whereas a mutated state has an increased frac-
tion of B alleles. The conditions defining these states for each
locus I are formulated below:
PMB, PNB, PM), PN, e N
PMf31;PNf51;PN,=2
PM? PNf.
W, > P—N,’
PM;; and PNf denote the ploidy of the B allele in each cell type:
mutated cells and normal cells, respectively. The value of PNf is
one if I has a germline variant, zero otherwise. PM 1 and PN, are the
total ploidy of mutated cells and normal cells. PM I is required to be
between one and cm”, that is, we exclude solutions for which the
maximum number of amplicons per cell exceeds the user-deﬁned
constant cm”. The choice of cm” should depend on genomic depth
of coverage and on the fraction of the genome sequenced: the
higher the quality and abundance of data, the higher cm”.
For each locus I, the equations below contrast the measured
total ploidy (2) and B allele ploidy (3) of all cells in the sample
to the sum of cell type-speciﬁc ploidies:

cnv(f,):PM,-fl+PNl-(l —f,)=CNl+em (2)
snv(f,):PMf -f, + PNf . (1 —f,)=(AFf + eaf) - (CN, + em), (3)

Where CN, and AFIB denote the copy number and B allele
frequency measured for I and em, eafe N(0,02) is normally

distributed noise that reﬂects the uncertainties in copy number
and allele frequency measurements, respectively. We calculate
the fraction f1 e]0,1] of mutated cells with respect to locus I
from the aforementioned equations for all ploidy combinations
(PMB, PMI) that satisfy 1. For each solution, we calculate an
error-term s as the deviation of the measured from the expected
allele frequency and copy number:

80?) = K- lcnv(fz)| + lsnv(fz)l + leml + leafl (4)

where K 2: (PM,— ||CN1||)2 + 1 is a penalty factor in favor of
ploidies that are close to the measured copy number. The prob-
ability Pl(f) that the mutation at locus I is present in a fraction f
of cells is obtained by ﬁtting a Gaussian mixture model on 810‘)
(Fig. 1A). As the equation system given by (2) and (3) is under-
determined, we obtain multiple solutions for the same locus
(Supplementary Fig. S1). For example, in a copy neutral
region, the allele frequency of a heterozygous mutation present
in 100% of the cells should be the same as that of a homozygous
mutation present in only 50% of the cells. The ambiguity of the
solutions depends on the measured allele frequency: low or high

more uniformly distributed solutions.

event that initiates the expansion, each clonal expansion should
be marked by multiple mutations.

Thus SNVs and CNVs that took place in a cell before a clonal
expansion should be present in a similar fraction of cells and
leave a similar trace in the subsequent clonal expansion. The
aim is to ﬁnd common peaks in the distribution of Pl(f) for
multiple mutated loci Z. In the first step, mutations with similar
P1(f) are grouped together by hierarchical cluster analysis of the
probability distributions Pl(f) using the KullbackeLeibler diver-
gence as a distance measure (Fig. 1B). The joint probability dis-
tribution of cell frequencies is computed for each cluster C as
follows:

I
Pcm : ﬁ'ZIecP’m

The cell frequency f C 2: arg mafoc(f) at each cluster-maxima
denotes the size of the SP that harbors the clustered mutations.
In the second step, each cluster C is extended by members with
similar distributions in an interval around the cluster-maxima
1C 2: [fc — 0.05,fC + 0.05] (highlighted in red in Fig. 1C).

2.2.3 Filtering Next, we keep only those clusters for which
maxfelc Pc( f ) 5 maxfélc Pc( f ) is rejected at a user-deﬁned P-
value (underlying statistical test: paired t-test). A rejection indi-
cates that mutations clustered in C are all present in the same
fraction of cellst (Fig. 1C). The number of remaining clusters
denotes the number of predicted clonal expansions. Tumor
purity is inferred as the size of the largest SP.

2.2.4 Assignment of SN Vs to clusters Finally, we assign
each locus l to C 2: argminc | argmafo1(f) —fC| (Fig. 1D).
The mutated loci assigned to each cluster represent the genetic
proﬁle of each predicted SP.

2.3 Validation and performance

We tested the performance of EXPANDS on a simulated and
two real datasets: 118 GBM exome sequencing samples from
TCGA (Supplementary Table S2) and one whole genome
sequenced breast cancer. Somatic point mutations and LOH
for each GBM sample were obtained by applying Mutect
(Cibulskis et al., 2013) on the tumor-derived BAM ﬁle and
the patient-matched normal BAM ﬁle. Copy-number segments
were calculated using an approach similar to ExomeCNV
(Sathirapongsasuti et al., 2011). SNVs outlying autosomes or
that cannot be explained by an SP present in 10% or more of
the sample (i.e. AF x CN<0.l) were excluded.

2.3.] Simulation To investigate how the abundance of muta-
tions in a sample and the noise in their measurement affect the
accuracy of SP predictions, a simulated dataset was generated,
consisting of n:350 samples. In each sample, we simulate
N 6 N(4, 3), 2 5 N 5 14 clonal expansions, each marked by a
variable number t of mutations, t e N(x,,0.3 - x,). Each muta-
tion was simulated as a triplet (ft, AFIB +eaf, CNl+ecn), where
i:{1..N}, fl. is the size of SP) and eaf,em eN(0,xe) are
normally distributed noise in allele frequency measurements
and in the estimation of local copy number, respectively. We
choose x3 e[0.02,0.1] to reﬂect distinct ranges of genomic

depth of coverage (as described in Supplementary Information:
the effect of genomic depth of coverage on allele frequency
noise). Allele frequency and copy number were calculated
according to Equations 173 from f,- and PM3 , PNB , PM ,, simu-
lated as Poisson distributions (see Supplementary Table S1).
Mutations that are ﬁxed in the tumor cell population are present
in the same fraction of cells, regardless whether they emerged
during one or during multiple clonal expansions (see Supplemen-
tary Fig. S2). To account for the fact that we cannot see past
the last fixation event, we further require that the first clonal
expansion harbors the majority of mutations among all
simulated expansions and that it gives rise to an SP present in
>50% of the tumor (i.e. simulated samples have >50% tumor
purity).

We predict the SP sizes x,- from the simulated allele frequencies
and copy numbers using EXPANDS and obtain a P—Value for
each predicted SP, reﬂecting the conﬁdence with which the SP
has been detected. We vary the upper threshold for the P—Value
below which we accept an SP and denote predictions for which
the deviation between true and predicted SP size: d: |x,~ —f,~|
is below 0.03 as true predictions. Figure 2A and B shows the
results of the validation experiment for varying x, and x3. As
expected, we observe an increase in the precision of EXPANDS
with increasing x, and decreasing x3. The numbers of simulated
and predicted SPs are mostly consistent (Fig. 2C). However,
EXPANDS underestimates the true number of distinct SPs
in samples with many coexisting SPs. Because SPs are detected
by their relative size in the tumor bulk, we expect more false-
negative (FN) predictions in samples with many SPs, as SPs
are more likely to have similar sizes. Furthermore, we observe
an enrichment of SP size 50% among FNs. This effect is a direct
consequence of the decreased kurtosis of cell frequency probabil-
ity distributions derived from moderate allele frequencies. Both
sources for FNs are illustrated in Supplementary Figure S3.

We conclude that EXPANDS predicts the number and size
of SPs with 5&80% accuracy given enough genomic depth of
coverage and fraction of the genome sequenced. On data of
lower depth and breadth of coverage, the number of SPs pre-
dicted by EXPANDS should not be considered absolute values,
but can provide a qualitative comparison among samples.

2.3.2 Dependence of EXPANDS prediction sensitivity on mutation
count The results of the simulation experiment described pre-
viously indicate that the prediction accuracy of EXPANDS
increases with the number of mutations that mark an SP
(Fig. 2A), which in turn depends on the genomic breadth of
coverage. We estimated the prediction accuracy of EXPANDS
on mutations detected in a hypermutated ER-positive breast
cancer genomeiPD4l20a (Nik-Zainal et al., 2012). The whole
genome of this breast cancer has been sequenced at 188-fold
coverage, providing high-quality data to investigate how repre-
sentative different areas of the genome are of coexisting SPs.
We applied EXPANDS to 7175 mutations scattered across
the exome and additional surrounding regions (total 300MB).
The predicted SPs were compared with SPs inferred by Nik-
Zainal et al. from mutations found in the whole genome.
The sizes of the SPs inferred by Nik-Zainal et al. were multiplied
by tumor purity (0.7), to make them comparable with our
predictions.

Fig. 3. EXPANDS prediction accuracy depends on mutation abundance.
Six consensus SPs were identiﬁed based on the allele frequency and copy
number of 7175 mutations detected within a hypermutated ER-positive
breast cancer genome (x-axis). The size of the consensus SPs was com-
pared with the size of SPs predicted based on mutations found in non-
overlapping regions of variable length. Mean deviation of predicted SP
size from each consensus SP size (y-axis) decreases with increasing
number of SNVs

We found considerable overlap between our predictions and
the observations by Nik-Zainal et al. For example, EXPANDS
inferred the same pattern of mutations and copy number alter-
ation in the two dominating SPs that were detected in the foun-
der clone inferred by NikeZainal. The details of the overlap are
described in Supplementary Figure S4. In addition to the four
mutation clusters identiﬁed by Nik-Zainal et al., EXPANDS
detected yet another two SPs present in 27 and 19% of the
sample, respectively, both marked by increasing genomic
instability. These observations conﬁrm substantial subclonal
copy number variations that occur rather late in tumor develop-
ment, as reported by Nik-Zainal et al. Importantly, the analysis
shows that ~10% of the mutations detected in the hypermutated
breast cancer genome are sufﬁcient to predict the SP composition

of this tumor at a resolution comparable with that obtained from
the whole genome.

To estimate how breadth of coverage affects the prediction
sensitivity of EXPANDS, we approximate the dependence of
prediction sensitivity on mutation abundance. We applied
EXPANDS on mutations found in 123 non-overlapping genomic
regions of variable length and compared the predicted SPs
with the consensus SPs described previously. We calculated the
deviation of the predicted SP size from the size of the consensus
SP (see Fig. 3). A deviation of 100% marked the absence of
the corresponding consensus SP from the predictions. As sug-
gested by the simulated dataset, SPs present in ~50% of the
sample are more difficult to detect and require a higher
number of marker mutations. The 19% SP was marked by a
lower fraction of mutations such that a higher fraction of the gen-
ome was required to observe enough mutations that are speciﬁc
to this SP. In contrast, SP-specific SNVs for the 11% SP were
overrepresented among all SNVs due to its tetraploid genome
(Supplementary Fig. S4). The high fraction of the genome
mutated in this SP allowed for its detection even at low mutation
count.

Our results indicate that mutations found in a region twice as
large as the cancer exome are sufﬁcient to identify at least 50% of
the SPs with 90% probability. We conclude that EXPANDS can
identify genetically distinct SPs that coexist in a tumor sample
based on only a fraction of the mutations present in that sample.
However, mutation rate and size distribution of SPs in the tumor
impact the sensitivity of the method. By modeling cellular muta-
tion frequencies as probability distributions, EXPANDS post-
pones having to decide on ﬁxed cellular mutation frequencies
and can thereby resolve the clonal composition of this complex
genome that harbors many copy number variations.

2.3.3 Robustness and speciﬁcity of subpopulation predictions We
tested the robustness of SP size predictions among independent

sets of non-overlapping SNVs detected in the same exome
sample. As this approach required splitting the SNVs detected
in one sample, we required that at least 290 SNVs (somatic mu-
tations and LOH) have been detected in total in that sample.
This criterion applied to 53 of the 118 GBM exome sequencing
samples from TCGA (Supplementary Table S2). For each
sample k, we split the detected somatic SNVs and LOH, in
two non-overlapping sets of similar size (SOMI +LOHI and
SOM2+LOH2). For each SNV set (number of SNVs in each
set: 12873897), we predict the SPs for sample k2

SP’f <— SOMl + LOH1; SP; <— SOM2 + LOH2

We choose a P-Value of 0.005 to accept a SP. No SPs could be
detected in nine cases at this P-Value. We then compare the con-
sistency between predictions within the same sample SP’f ﬂ SP’ZC
to that between predictions of pairwise distinct samples:
SP; (1 SPfjn, where i 75 j; m, n 6 {1,2}. To exclude run-speciﬁc
effects as the cause of robust predictions, we required that
sample i and j were processed on the same plate and that a
similar number of SNVs (max. deviation: 50 SNVs) were
detected in each member of the sample pair. Two SPs were con-
sidered overlapping if their size was <0.03 apart. The fraction of
overlapping SPs among the matching pairs (mean:0.59) was
significantly increased (t-test: P:5.3E-12) compared with the
random pairs (mean : 0.23), indicating that two mutually exclu-
sive sets of SNVs from the same sample reveal similar SPs
(Supplementary Fig. S5).

Here we used the predicted SP size to validate the robustness of
SP predictions. The size of a SP correlates almost exactly with its
SNV content as shown in Supplementary Figure S6, and can
therefore be used as a measure of SP identity. We conclude that
EXPANDS can identify tumor-speciﬁc clonal expansions and the
size of the resulting SPs in the tumor bulk in a robust manner.

2.3.4 Tumor purity predictions Next we compared tumor purity
predictions by EXPANDS with those performed by
ABSOLUTE (Carter et al., 2012) and to histological purity
estimates.

We applied EXPANDS to allele frequency and copy number
measurements obtained from exome sequences. We assumed that
the largest SP predicted by EXPANDS is a product of the ﬁrst
or multiple early clonal expansion(s). Therefore, we expected
the size of the largest SP to predict the percentage of tumor
cells in the sample, i.e. tumor purity. In addition, we predicted
tumor purity using ABSOLUTE from copy number measure-
ments obtained from SNP6 array data. Both approaches were
applied to identical areal samples of 66 GBM, which are a subset
of the samples introduced in Section 2.3.

We found that tumor purities predicted by ABSOLUTE and
EXPANDS were largely consistent (Fig. 4), with a median devi-
ation of 0.11. One possible explanation for the deviation between
the predictions by the two approaches is that high numbers
of subclonal SNVs and CNVs interfere with purity estimations.
It is noteworthy that ABSOLUTE detects subclonal mutations
by allowing for deviations in copy number from the discrete
levels. However, this strategy supports only a moderate fraction
of subclonal events (Carter et al., 2012). To determine whether
high subclonality impedes tumor purity predictions by
ABSOLUTE, we quantiﬁed tumor heterogeneity. To do this,

Fig. 4. Comparison of tumor purity prediction approaches. The fraction
of tumor cells in each of 66 GBM samples were predicted by EXPANDS
(ExP) and ABSOLUTE (ABS). The deviation between predicted tumor
purity and histological purity estimates was compared between samples
of low and high subclonality. Note that ABSOLUTE and EXPANDS
performed similarly on samples of low to moderate subclonality.
EXPANDS provided estimates of tumor purity that were closer to histo-
logical purity estimates in samples of high subclonality than ABSOLUTE
(t-test: P : 9.3E-4)

we took the number and size of SP predictions made by
EXPANDS and computed the Shannon index for each sample.
The Shannon index is a common measure of species diversity in
ecology and has recently been adopted to quantify diversity in
tumor samples (Merlo et al., 2010).

For samples with a low to moderate Shannon index (lower
0.75 quantile), EXPANDS and ABSOLUTE performed simi-
larly with respect to histology purity predictions. Notably,
EXPANDS tumor purity predictions were closer to histological
purity estimates than ABSOLUTE in samples with high intra-
tumoral heterogeneity (upper 0.25 quantile) (Fig. 4). Thus, we
conclude that ABSOLUTE underestimates purity for tumors
with high subclonality and that EXPANDS is the preferred
approach for tumor purity predictions in highly heterogeneous
samples.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Predicting GBM subpopulation dynamics

EXPANDS complements tumor purity estimations with predic-
tions of the size and clonal composition of SPs and the identiﬁ-
cation of mutations that mark these SPs within a single tumor.

To predict the SP composition of GBM at diagnosis, we
applied EXPANDS to somatic mutation and LOH detected in
the tumors of 108 GBM patients available at TCGA. Our results
indicate that each GBM at the time of surgery consists of
between 1 and 16 SPs (median:7). Not only did the number
of SPs differ, but also the genetic profiles of individual SPs were

highly diverse among patients. The predicted size of the SPs
ranged between 10 and 100% of the total cells in the sample,
with a median of 42 SNVs per SP (Supplementary Table S2). The
data show feasibility that EXPANDS can be applied to a sizeable
patient group to predict the clonal evolution individually for
each tumor patient.

For 10 of the 108 patients, exome data from patient-matched
primary and recurrent GBM were available (Supplementary
Fig. S7) and were analyzed for SP changes on recurrence, in
the context of clinical information.

In patient TCGA-14-1034, 8 SPs were detected in the primary
tumor and 12 SPs in the recurrent tumor. Strikingly, dominant
SPs detected in the recurrent tumor shared no signiﬁcant pro-
portion of SNVs with SPs from the primary tumor (Fig. 5A).

In contrast, in patient TCGA-06—0125, eight SPs were detected
in the primary tumor and four in the recurrent tumor. Two of

these SPs shared a signiﬁcant fraction of SNVs between primary
and recurrent tumor (Fig. 5B) suggesting that these recurrent SPs
descend from primary SPs that have presumably survived treat-
ment. Genes mutated in the treatment-surviving SPs include
those with brain-specific tissue expression: NPBWR2, NEFH,
GLRA3, CHAT and NDRG4 and those with a function
in cell growth, differentiation, mitotic cycle and oncogenic trans-
formation, such as PTPNl 17a member of the protein tyrosine
phosphatase family (Pruitt et al., 2012).

In contrast, the other two SPs in this recurrent tumor could
not be assigned to any SP in the primary GBM. These new SPs
were marked by 30 non-silent mutations, including missense mu-
tations in MAP2K3 (a member of the MAP kinase kinase
family) and PLXNCl (a member of the plexin family). These
two cases thus showed different SP composition dynamics with
recurrence. Analyses of eight additional cases further conﬁrmed

Fig. 5. Genetic changes in primary and recurrent GBM SPs. The predicted clonal composition of matched primary and recurrent GBM is shown for two
patients: (A) TCGA-14-1034 and (B) TCGA-06-0125. Genetically unique clones emerge as a consequence of accumulating beneﬁcial mutations and
expand into SPs (represented by different colors). The lower x-axis shows the relative timing of clonal expansions by indicating the fraction of mutations
that have accumulated in the entire tumor before the onset of each expansion. The upper box indicates timing of clinical events relative to the time from
tumor initiation to ﬁrst surgery (set to 237 daysithe mean time between the ﬁrst and the second surgery among the 10 matched patients). The y-axis
indicates the percent (%) representation of each SP in the sequenced tumor bulk at the time of the first and second surgery. EXPANDS infers the
presence of multiple SPs that coexist in the primary tumor at ﬁrst surgery. After the ﬁrst surgery, (sometimes followed by radiation, chemotherapy), the
tumor recurs and EXPANDS infers the evolution of the recurrent tumor SPs. Each SP in the recurrent tumor is colored based on its predicted ancestor in
the primary tumor. New SPs that were absent or undetectable in the primary GBM and emerged only on recurrence remain white. Note that the SP
composition and dynamics in the two patients are different. Both patients start out with eight SPs in the primary tumors. The recurrent tumor of TCGA-
14-1034 harbors 12 coexisting SPs that share little similarity to the primary SPs. In contrast the recurrent tumor of TCGA-06-0125 has only four SPs, two
of which could be assigned to primary SPs. (C) Candidate driver genes mutated in fittest GBM SPs. Signiﬁcantly mutated genes in selected SPs of 69

that SP compositions invariably change with recurrence and that
SP dynamics during recurrence are highly individualized. One
scenario observed was that none of the SPs detected in the pri-
mary tumor was dominant on recurrence (TCGA-l4-1034;
TCGA-06-0152; TCGA-06-0171). In the second scenario, some
SPs survive whereby in 4 of 10 cases one of the dominant SPs in
the primary tumor persisted as dominant SP in the recurrent
tumor (TCGA-06-0190, TCGA-06-02ll, TCGA-06-022l and
TCGA-06-0125). In the remaining cases, smaller SPs of the pri-
mary tumor became dominant on recurrence (TCGA-l9-4065;
TCGA-06-0210; TCGA-14—0736) (Fig. 5 and Supplementary
Fig. S8).

Notably, for patients who received standard treatment (radi-
ation and temozolomide) between the ﬁrst and second surgery,
we observed a by trend elevated numbers of mutations in the
recurrent as compared with the primary tumor (t-test: P: 0.12,
data not shown). Moreover, we observed that temozolomide
treatment before recurrence shows a tendency to co-occur with
a decreased number of SPs in the recurrent tumor as compared
with the primary GBM. In contrast, patients who did not receive
chemotherapy and radiation therapy had an elevated number of
SPs in the recurrent tumor as compared with the primary GBM
(t-test: P:0.08, Supplementary Fig. S9).

Taken together based on data from a small sample set, we
provide evidence that tumor recurrence signiﬁcantly changes
the SP composition of tumors and is highly individualized.
Data from this limited sample set can be used in conjunction
with clinical information to formulate a hypothesis on the effects
of temozolomide treatment on intra-tumoral heterogeneity and
test it on a large dataset using EXPANDS.

3.2 Identiﬁcation of candidate genes affecting
subpopulation ﬁtness

Next, we aimed to identify genes that when mutated provide a
substantial selective advantage to SPs in primary and recurrent
GBM. To this end, we first identiﬁed the SPs present in at least
60% of the sample (SP size 30.6) as the dominant SPs in the
primary tumors, further denoted as SPD. We rationalized that
SNVs that mark these SPD are of interest as they might contrib-
ute to the successful growth of SPDs and thus to overall tumor
growth and recurrence. We then applied MutSig (Lawrence
et al., 2013) on 5173 somatic SNVs assigned to 136 SPD from
69 primary GBM patients whereby we identiﬁed genes that were
mutated in SPD more often than expected by chance. Not sur-
prisingly, the top 20 signiﬁcant hits identiﬁed by MutSig were
enriched for genes previously known to be involved in glioma—
genesis: TP53, PTEN, PIK3R1 and TGFA (Pruitt et al., 2012).
The enrichment of these gene alterations in SPD suggests that
they are highly prevalent in individual tumors and further cor-
roborate their role as GBM driver mutations. A detailed View of
the intra-tumoral prevalence of known GBM driver mutations is
provided in Supplementary Figure S10. In addition to known
GBM drivers, the top hits list contained genes previously not
associated with GBM, such as DLK2, CEACAM7 and RPL37
(Fig. 5C and Supplementary Table S3Fnovel candidate genes
to be tested for their role in tumorigenesis.

Next, we aimed to identify those genes that when mutated
provide SPs with a selective growth advantage on treatment and

are thus important for recurrence. SPs found in the recurrent
tumor, could either have survived treatment and stem from
an ancestral SP in the primary tumor or could have emerged
de novo perhaps due to treatment. We identiﬁed the ancestral
SP for each SP in the recurrent tumor by taking into account
size and shared mutation frequency: We hypothesize that
two SPs that share many of their mutations are likely to be
closely related clones. Second, SPs that were small in the
primary tumors and became large (dominant) on recurrence
potentially carry a genetic signature that is relevant for recur-
rence (Supplementary Fig. S2). Based on this hypothesis, we
assume that the ancestral SP is the smallest SP in the primary
tumor that shares a minimum of 10% of the mutations assigned
to the SP in the recurrent tumor. SPs found in the recurrent
tumor for which we could identify an ancestral SP are further
denoted SPR.

We found 887 SNVs assigned to 26 SPR detected in eight re-
current GBM patients. Among the 20 most significantly mutated
genes were regulators of transforming growth factor beta signal-
ing (RBBP9 and DPT) and regulators of AKT signaling
(TCLlB) (Pruitt et al., 2012) as well as other genes that have
not been tested speciﬁcally for their role in GBM recurrence
(Supplementary Table S3).

Taken together, these findings show that EXPANDS can
guide the analysis of SP dynamics on recurrence and can be
used in combination with clinical data to correlate treatment
effects with tumor heterogeneity. EXPANDS generates muta-
tional profiles of dominant SPs in primary and recurrent
tumors that can be used to find novel candidate genes with po-
tential functions in GBM growth and recurrence, respectively.

4 DISCUSSION

4.1.] Tumor heterogeneity and purity predictions by
EXPANDS We present EXPANDS, a method to systematic-
ally identify and characterize tumor heterogeneity and clonal SP
dynamics. To our knowledge, it is the first automated method
that predicts intra-tumoral genetic heterogeneity from sequen-
cing data of moderate coverage by assessing clonal composition
of tumors using allele fractions of single nucleotide variants and
copy number changes.

EXPANDS presents several useful features that provide an
improvement over existing approaches: it can be applied to
single tumor samples and is amenable to analyze differences in
tumor heterogeneity within large datasets. Our approach detects
differences in the number, distribution and content of SPs among
GBM and led us to conclude that individual and independent
tumor profiles need to be generated to properly describe intra-
tumoral heterogeneity in GBM. It will be interesting to apply
EXPANDS to other tumor types to determine the extent and
pattern of heterogeneity. Our method is informative for tumor
purity estimation, even for samples of high subclonality, where
EXPANDS purity predictions were closer to histological esti-
mates than tumor purity predictions by ABSOLUTE.

Another feature of EXPANDS is that it predicts SPs that can
share a subset of their mutations/CNVs and thus can be nested
within each other. In contrast, Tolliver et al. describes tumor
mixture separation from gene expression or aCGH data but

requires convex combinations of SP sizesithat is, the approach
detects SPs with mutually exclusive properties (Tolliver et al.,
2010). This is achieved based on the assumptions that genes/
probes with similar patterns across multiple subpopulations are
eliminated in a principal component analysis step. In addition,
the number of SPs is required as an input. Finally, the method by
Tolliver et al. requires multiple tumor-samples (distinct patients)
as an input, whereas EXPANDS predicts SPs independently,
from sequencing data obtained from individual patients.

The validation of SP content, i.e. the accuracy with which
SNVs are assigned to individual SPs, is not feasible in the ab-
sence of geographical sampling. However, EXPANDS assigns
SNVs to SPs based on the fraction of cells that harbor the
SNV. The SNVs assigned to a SP in turn determine the size of
the SP. Therefore, SP size is highly correlated to SP content and
can be used as a measure of SP similarity (Supplementary Fig.
S6). In future experiments, SP sizes estimated by EXPANDS will
be validated by other methods such as ﬂuorescence in situ
hybridization.

4.1.2 Clinical information and EXPANDS The genetic and
phenotypic cellular heterogeneity is a hallmark of many cancers
that obscures the contribution of individual cancer cells to tumor
progression and therapy resistance. Studies in Barrett’s esopha-
gus (Merlo et al., 2010) and head and neck squamous cell car-
cinoma (Mroz et al., 2013) showed that high genetic
heterogeneity estimated from geographical studies predicts
poor prognosis. This intra-tumor heterogeneity can explain the
incomplete response of tumors to therapeutic intervention and
tumor recurrence. The number of coexisting SPs predicted by
EXPANDS and their size provide a quantitative measure of
tumor heterogeneity and can be translated into common meas-
ures of diversity, such as the Simpsons and Shannon indices.
Using EXPANDS data on a small number of cases, we observed
a tendency of primary GBM treated with temozolomide to recur
with a reduced number of SPs. Temozolomide treatment has
previously been shown to provide a survival beneﬁt for GBM
patients. A larger dataset is needed to conﬁrm or refute that
temozolomide consistently decreases SP heterogeneity on recur-
rence. If conﬁrmed it will be interesting to determine whether
reduced SP heterogeneity is predictive of a survival beneﬁt for
treatments in general.

4.1.3 Candidate gene predictions derived from EXPANDS
data EXPANDS predicts what mutations mark coexisting
SPs at the time of tumor detection and can thereby help guide
therapeutic choices such that multiple SPs can be targeted and
eliminated simultaneously. We have identiﬁed a list of genes sig-
niﬁcantly mutated in dominant SPs in the primary tumors. These
include genes previously implicated in GBM such as PTEN and
TP53. Importantly, the list also includes novel genes without a
previously demonstrated function in gliomagenesis. These genes
may be tested by molecular functional experiments for their role
in tumor formation.

In addition, our analyses provided a list of genes mutated in
SPs that survived in the recurrent tumors. In future experiments,
our method will be applied on a large number of samples to
identify SPs that survived therapy and recurrent mutations
within these SPs as candidates with a testable role in

promoting recurrence. In combination with clinical information,
EXPANDS will be useful to test for genetic determinants of
therapy response and could be of predictive value.

4.2 The role of CNV in the detection of subpopulation size

EXPANDS uses the copy number and the B allele frequency of
mutated loci to infer the frequency of cells that harbor these
mutations. The advantage of clustering the inferred cell frequen-
cies over allele frequency clustering lies in the dependence of
allele frequencies on copy number. Copy number changes
within any cell in the sequenced sample affect the measured
allele frequency. As an example, we consider a diploid locus l2
and a haploid locus l], where each locus has exactly one mutated
allele (BIZ, B“) and both mutations co-occur in an SP of size 0.6
(60% of the cells have both, 40% have neither mutation). Owing
to different underlying copy numbers, the expected allele fre-
quency of B12 is 0.3 and that of Bll is 0.6, despite their
common SP—origin. We conclude that copy number has to be
included to accurately estimate the fraction of cells that harbor
speciﬁc mutations, especially in cancer-genomes with high gen-
etic instability, where CNVs are abundant.

Allele frequency distributions show a similar pattern across
tumor samples in general. A perfectly pure tumor sample, with
no normal cell contamination and one homogeneous tumor cell
population is expected to have a few homozygous mutations with
a peak at 1.0 and heterozygous mutations Visible at a peak
around 0.5. However, because tumor samples are often contami-
nated with normal cells, both peaks are typically shifted to the
left, on average around 0.7 and 0.35. In addition, peaks below
0.2 indicate the presence of subclonal mutations (Supplementary
Fig. S11). SNVs within LOH are Visible as one peak above 0.8.
The increased allele frequency of SNVs within LOH regions
is caused by the presence of the germline variant in at least one
copy of all cells.

In contrast to allele frequency distributions, the distributions
of cell frequencies are distinct among tumor samples and increase
the resolution on the SPs present in that sample. The adjustment
of allele frequencies by copy numbers allows the inclusion of
germline variants within LOH regions in the SP size predictions.
As prediction accuracy increases with the number of passenger
mutations that occur in a cell before its expansion, the abun-
dance of LOH makes these events a valuable resource in the
SP size prediction, especially in tumor types with low numbers
of somatic point mutations.

4.3 Limitations and outlook

An underlying assumption of our model is that SP—specific mu-
tations are present in a fraction of cells that is speciﬁc to the SP
in which these mutations reside. As a consequence, two or more
distinct SPs that coexist in the same tumor at equal proportions
will be identiﬁed as just one SP. The sensitivity with which
EXPANDS distinguishes individual SPs, that is, how much
two SPs have to differ in their size for them to be recognized
as two distinct SPs, depends on the noise in copy number and
allele frequency measures, the number of SNVs that mark each
of these SPs and the size of the SPs itself. In the case of NGS
data, this translates to a dependence on coverage, base- and

mapping qualities as well as consistent experimental conditions
for tumor and control samples.

A limitation of this current study is the sample size used in the
analysis of matched primary and recurrent GBM. Providing
answers to the question of how therapy affects SP composition
on recurrence and what genetic changes provide SPs from the
recurrent tumor with the ability to survive therapy will require a
larger set of trios and a larger proportion of the cancer genomes
sequenced (e.g. whole genome sequencing) to increase the reso-
lution on SP content.

EXPANDS allows for quantiﬁcation of tumor purity and of
heterogeneity Via Shannon index, Simpsons index and genetic
divergence (Merlo et al., 2010). In the future, EXPANDS will
be applied to a larger patient group for which sequencing data
are available to determine tumor purity and SP composition.
EXPANDS will be useful in the context of clinical information
to reveal possible associations between the extent of intra-
tumoral heterogeneity, the genetic proﬁle of individual SPs and
clinical outcome. Studies will be extended to investigate possible
relationships between therapeutic intervention and speciﬁc
patterns of SP dynamics in GBM and other cancer types.

Moreover, longitudinal studies of SPs predicted by
EXPANDS can help determine whether SP—speciﬁc gene muta-
tions pre—existed in the primary tumor or were acquired de novo
during recurrence and thus are expected to provide new insights
into the mechanisms for recurrence.

5 CONCLUSIONS

We present an approach that predicts the number of SPs that
coexist in a tumor, the size of the SPs in the tumor bulk, the
mutations that mark each SP and the extent of normal cell
contamination. This information will be useful to complement
geographical sampling, especially in the case of intermixed tumor
cell populations. EXPANDS can be applied on SNVs and CNVs
derived from sequencing data of various depth and breadth of
coverage including exome and whole genome sequencing data
and is unique in that it takes an unbiased approach to provide
an unprecedented extent of individualized predictions. It can be
applied to all types of cancer for which NGS data are available,
to address crucial questions about tumor heterogeneity and
recurrence mechanisms.

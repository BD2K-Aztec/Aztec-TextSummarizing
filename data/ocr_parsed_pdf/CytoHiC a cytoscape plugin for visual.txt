upload data before normalization, if they are given in one of the
supported formats. A user manual is incorporated in the
Cytoscape’s help content, providing details on general usage
and supported ﬁle formats.

2.1 Network generation

Given a set of bins, a contact matrix and landmarks of interest,
CytoHiC matches landmarks to bins and calculates the contact
value between each pair of landmarks. When a landmark is
spread over more than one bin, the contact value is calculated
as a weighted sum, so that the weight is proportional to the
overlap between the bin and the landmark. The spatial network
is then generated, where landmarks correspond to nodes and
(undirected) edges are weighted by the inverse of the contact
value, for an approximation of physical proximity. A relation—
ship of inverse proportion between contact frequencies and phys—
ical proximity was previously suggested by Fraser et a]. (2009).
When the contact value is not available or when the contact
value is zero (owing to limited coverage of the Hi—C data or
owing to normalization correction), there will be no edge
between the landmarks.

2.2 Network visualization

The network is drawn using a force—directed layout algorithm
(available from Cytoscape’s layout algorithm collection), based
on the edge weights. Users may also explore other layouts based
on the edge weight attribute. The details of the nodes and edges
are available by hovering and from the node and edge browsers
of Cytoscape.

By default, nodes are colored by their chromosome afflliation
(i.e. landmarks in the same chromosome will have the same
color). However, when the user specifies an additional property
of interest (for the landmarks), nodes are colored by a blue and
red gradient with respect to the range of the property’s values.
For example, if a methylation level is specified, each node (land—
mark) will be colored accordingly. Highly methylated landmarks
will appear in dark red and under—methylated landmarks will be
colored in dark blue. Intermediate methylation levels will be as—
signed with intermediate colors. The edges are labeled by their
weight (approximation of distance), with a line style matching
the interaction type they represent. A solid line corresponds to an
interaction within a chromosome (intra—interaction), and a
dashed line corresponds to an interaction between chromosomes
(inter—interaction).

2.3 Visual comparison of landmarks

The option to visually compare networks is available from the
CytoHiC menu and from a right—click pop—up. The user may

compare two networks or compare a current network with an—
other network. The nodes (landmarks) are labeled with indices so
that matching landmarks can be easily compared (the indices are
given according to the ordering of the landmarks ﬁle).

3 CONCLUSION

CytoHiC is a platform—independent easy to install plugin for
Cytoscape. It offers visual exploration and comparison so users
can instantly and easily observe trends and changes in the spatial
environment of genomic landmarks. Users may explore spatial
changes from evolutionary, functional, developmental and clin—
ical point of views. As Hi—C data take its important place in the
research of nuclear architecture, visual exploration applications
such as CytoHiC become an important part of the required
toolbox.

While the spatial networks generated by CytoHiC provide the
user an approximation for physical proximity based on inter—
action frequencies, we hope to offer better methods for predict—
ing the nuclear positions of landmarks and to fix coverage and
correction errors in the future. Incorporation of such methods
with a visualization tool can provide a more accurate represen—
tation of the nucleus topological map.

Abstract

Motivation: The systematic study of subcellular location pattern is very important for fully charac—
terizing the human proteome. Nowadays, with the great advances in automated microscopic imag—
ing, accurate bioimage—based classification methods to predict protein subcellular locations are
highly desired. All existing models were constructed on the independent parallel hypothesis,
where the cellular component classes are positioned independently in a multi—class classification
engine. The important structural information of cellular compartments is missed. To deal with this
problem for developing more accurate models, we proposed a novel cell structure—driven classifier
construction approach (SC—PSorter) by employing the prior biological structural information in the
learning model. Specifically, the structural relationship among the cellular components is reflected
by a new codeword matrix under the error correcting output coding framework. Then, we construct
multiple SC—PSorter—based classifiers corresponding to the columns of the error correcting output
coding codeword matrix using a multi—kernel support vector machine classification approach.
Finally, we perform the classifier ensemble by combining those multiple SC—PSorter—based classi—
fiers via majority voting.

Results: We evaluate our method on a collection of 1636 immunohistochemistry images from the
Human Protein Atlas database. The experimental results show that our method achieves an overall
accuracy of 89.0%, which is 6.4% higher than the state—of—the—art method.

1 Introduction

One important task in the research of proteomics is to explore the
natural function of proteins in performing and regulating the activ-
ities of an organism at cell level (Breker and Schuldiner, 2014). It is
wider recognized that the function of a protein is closely associated
with its corresponding cellular compartments (Chebira et (11., 2007).
Proteins can only find their correct interacting molecules at the right
place. Thus, subcellular location can provide important clues for

understanding the function of a protein. With the breakthrough of
genome sequencing and hioimaging techniques, traditional time-
consuming and expensive wet-laboratory experimental approaches
cannot catch up with the speed of newly known proteins (Zhang
et (11., 2006). Hence, finding an automatic computational way to de-
termine the subcellular locations of proteins has been becoming a
focus in computational biology (Glory and Murphy, 2007). From
the perspective of machine learning, this task can be transformed

into a multi—class or multi—label classification problem. This is a
two—step framework, where we first need to figure out a proper fea—
ture representation way for encoding the protein data, which then
will be fed into a trained machine learning model for label decision.
There are two major research categories depending on how the pro—
tein data are represented, i.e. one—dimensional amino sequence and
two—dimensional image (Xu et al., 2013).

On one hand, if a protein is represented in amino acid sequence,
PseAAC (Chou, 2001), PSSM (Jeong et al., 2011; Pierleoni et al.,
2011) and gene ontology (Chi, 2010) are among the applied se—
quence—based features. In the second step, various machine learning
algorithms have been proposed. For instance, researchers in Yoon
and Lee (2012) adopted a boosting framework to accomplish the
classification task, and in Wang and Li (2013), a random label selec—
tion method was presented to learn the label correlations from train—
ing dataset to guide the classification for multi—label proteins.

On the other hand, accompanied with the explosive increments
in genomic data, we witnessed great advances in automated micro—
scopic imaging in recent years (Peng et al., 2012). Because of the in—
tuitive characteristics of images compared with amino acid
sequence, bioimage—based protein subcellular distribution pattern
analysis has attracted much attention. For example, it is found that
image—based analysis can be successfully used to detect protein bio—
markers, which will dynamically change their subcellular locations
in the cancerous tissues (Kumar et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2013, 2015).

If proteins are represented with two—dimensional images, e.g.
through fluorescent or immunohistochemistry microscopy, the
most widely used image features can be grouped into two catego—
ries, i.e. global and local features. For global feature, the DNA fea—
ture (Boland and Murphy, 2001) is designed to characterize DNA
distribution in a cell image. Since there is high co—occurrence of
protein and DNA in a protein image, we can infer the relative pos—
ition of protein according to the DNA distribution. Besides,
Haralick feature based on db wavelet is another global feature to
describe image texture such as inertia and isotropy, which is
demonstrated to be robust to cell rotations and translations
(Murphy et al., 2003; Newberg and Murphy, 2008). As to local
feature, LBP (Ojala et al., 1996) feature is the most frequently
applied descriptor to characterize the spatial structure of images
involving flat areas, edges and spots. Some extensions are also re—
ported. Yang et al. (2014) constructed a mixed local feature set by
adding two extensive forms of LBP, i.e. LTP (Tan and Triggs,
2010) and LQP (Nanni et al., 2010). Coelho et al. (Coelho et al.,
2013) applied the SURF feature to handle the classification prob—
lem in cell images.

Considering different features will have their own advantages, a
common strategy is to fuse multiple types of features. For instance,
different features are concatenated as a long vector to perform the
subsequent classification task (Newberg and Murphy, 2008; Xu
et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2014). Intuitively, since single type of fea—
tures cannot reflect all the information of a protein image, fusing
multiple types of features together is expected to be a more promis—
ing way.

For learning algorithms design, Boland et a]. (1998) applied neu—
ral networks to classify four protein types; Yang et a]. (2014) pro—
posed a probability—based support vector machine (SVM) to predict
the subcellular location of proteins in human reproductive system.
By considering a high ratio of human proteins co—exist at different
locations, Xu et al. (2013) designed a multi—label classification
classifier. Other efforts include Chebira et al. (2007) used a multi—
resolution approach, and logistic regression algorithm with latent
variables was proposed in Li et a]. (2012).

Although much progress has been achieved in designing differ—
ent statistical classifiers, to the best of our knowledge, none of the
existing image—based classifiers takes the biological cell structure
information into consideration, which has already been demon—
strated to be effective in solving biological sorting problems (Lin
et al., 2011). The basic hypothesis of existing predictors is to paral—
lelly consider every cellular component class regardless of their or—
ganizations in the cell. It is expected that better performance will
be achieved when we incorporate the cell nature component organ—
ization structure into the model construction.

To enable the learned model to incorporate the subcellular
component organization structure, we propose a new classifier
learning approach by utilizing the error correcting output coding
(ECOC) framework (Dietterich and Bakiri, 1995). This new ap—
proach can decompose the multi—class problem into several binary
classification problems according to the prior human cell
structural information. The final decision will then be made by
combining the results of these binary classifiers. In the new
structure—driven learning approach, we first construct a codeword
matrix to reflect the biological structure of cellular compartments
with ECOC. Then, for each binary classifier corresponding to the
columns of the ECOC codeword matrix, we use kernel combin—
ation method to fuse different types of features rather than the
direct combination strategy. Finally, we perform the classifier en—
semble by combining multiple classifiers via majority voting. The
experimental results show that our method performs much better
than several state—of—the—art methods, because the proposed ap—
proach has incorporated the cell structure prior knowledge into
model generation.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Dataset

Starting from 2005, the researchers use the antibody—based tech—
nique to functional study of the human proteome and build the well—
known Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database (Uhlen et al., 2005).
In the recent 13th version of HPA database, 86% of human genome
is involved. Specifically, 16 ;975 genes with 24 028 antibodies have
been covered to 46 different normal human tissues and 20 different
cancer types.

In this study, we have generated a collection of 1636 immunohis—
tochemistry images with high validation and objective scores
(Ponten et al., 2008) from HPA as our benchmark dataset. It con—
tains 21 proteins related to 46 normal human tissues. And each
image belongs to one of the seven most frequently appeared subcel—
lular locations, namely, cytoplasm, Golgi apparatus, mitochondrion,
vesicles, nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum and lysosome. Table 1 sum—
marizes the distribution of our dataset.

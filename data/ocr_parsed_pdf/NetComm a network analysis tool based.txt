ABSTRACT

Motivation: Set-based network similarity metrics are increasingly
used to productively analyze genome-wide data. Conventional
approaches, such as mean shortest path and clique-based metrics,
have been useful but are not well suited to all applications.
Computational scientists in other disciplines have developed commu-
nicability as a complementary metric. Network communicability con-
siders all paths of all lengths between two network members. Given
the success of previous network analyses of protein—protein inter-
actions, we applied the concepts of network communicability to this
problem. Here we show that our communicability implementation has
advantages over traditional approaches. Overall, analyses suggest
network communicability has considerable utility in analysis of large-
scale biological networks.

Availability and implementation: We provide our method as an R
package for use in both human protein—protein interaction network
analyses and analyses of arbitrary networks along with a tutorial at
http://www.shawlab.org/NetComm/.

1 INTRODUCTION

Many types of biological data, for example proteineprotein inter-
actions, coexpression data and biomedical research literature
naturally lend themselves to formation of interconnected net-
works. While ﬁnding meaningful connections between network
members (i.e. nodes, proteins or genes) can be challenging, net-
works provide an opportunity to contextualize results at the
system level. Standard analyses rely on relationships between
individual pairs of nodes and can be vulnerable to stochasticity
and technical errors. Identifying sets of relationships between
individual nodes and groups of others is one strategy for a
more robust metric of connectedness. The challenge remains to
retain topological information while simplifying network inter-
actions into univariate representations for statistical analysis and
comparison with other data types.

A number of metrics have been successfully applied to the
analysis of biological networks previously (Brohée et al., 2008).
Shortest path analysis assesses the fewest connections (i.e. edges)
required to connect a query node to one or more targets.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.
7‘The authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the ﬁrst two
authors should be regarded as Joint First Authors.

However, nodes which themselves have many connections (i.e.
high degree) are on average closer to all nodes. Therefore, iden-
tifying meaningful relationships by shortest path often requires
some form of degree correction. Another weakness of shortest
path analysis is that two or more paths of the same length are
equivalent to a single path of that length. Thus, information
regarding connectedness is lost. Jaccard similarity between two
nodes is the quotient of the intersection and the union of their k-
th degree interactors (Jaccard, 1912). This metric is useful for
testing connections to ‘near by’ nodes, but performs poorly for
nodes that are far apart. The method of random walk mean first
passage assesses how soon a random walk leaving a node takes
to reach a given target (Noh and Rieger, 2003). This metric may
also require degree correction.

Researchers in physics have proposed communicability as a
metric of connectedness (Estrada and Hatano, 2008). We previ-
ously used communicability to identify proteins connected in the
human PPI network to a set of epilepsy proteins to aid identiﬁ-
cation of novel epilepsy genes (Campbell et al., 2013).
Communicability considers paths of all lengths between two
nodes scaled by the factorial of path length (Estrada and
Hatano, 2008), retaining more information about connectedness
compared with shortest path metrics. It remains useful across
greater path lengths compared with Jaccard similarity and
avoids algorithmic stochasticity. Communicability is still inﬂu-
enced by degree and is challenged by large networks such as the
human proteineprotein interaction network. Here, we propose a
degree-normalized network connectedness metric inspired by
network communicability and suitable for analysis of large com-
plex networks. We provide an implementation for the human
PPI network, as well as tools for arbitrary networks.

2 METHODS

Finite network communicability
Communicability Cit, between two nodes i and j counts paths of all
lengths between them. Contributions are scaled so that longer paths con-
tribute less than shorter ones (Estrada and Hatano, 2008). Using the
adjacency matrix A, where the [J entry is 1 if nodes are connected and
0 otherwise, communicability is deﬁned:
00 Ak _ _ l Ak __
CiJ=Z%=(eA),-J EJ=Z% (1)
k=1 k=1
Evaluating eA for large networks is possible (Estrada and Hatano, 2008).
However, when we investigated use of conventional network communic-
ability in genome-wide networks, we found size and interconnectedness
resulted in large values and loss of variability between nodes. Thus, we
investigated a metric we deem ﬁnite network communicability Fit,
considering ﬁnite path lengths from 1 to 1 (Equation 1). Preliminary
analysis revealed our metric was vulnerable to node degree. Thus, we

normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard devi-
ation in that row:

 = 2—2; (2)
— k=1

where 0in is the standard deviation of the i-th row of the k-th power of
the adjacency matrix. To compute the metric F” to a set of target nodes
T, we computed the mean across the set of nodes for each power
(Equation 2). Other metrics of center and scale such as median and inter-
quartile range can also be used.

Human disease network and genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) catalog

Phenotypic classes for Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM)
disease genes were extracted computationally from the Supplementary
Tables from Goh et a]. (2007). Genes assigned to multiple classes because
different mutations of the same gene cause different phenotypes (allelic
heterogeneity) were allowed; however, each gene could contribute to the
same class only once. For shortest path analysis, we computed the mean
shortest path for each node to each disease class and centered and scaled
in a manner analogous to network communicability.

Gene—disease associations from GWAS were downloaded from the
National Human Genome Research Institute Catalogue of Published
GWAS (Welter et al., 2014). Diseases ‘type 1 diabetes’, ‘type 2 diabetes’,
‘breast cancer’, ‘age-related macular degeneration’ and ‘coronary heart
disease’ were selected because of a large quantity of associations and
diverse etiologies. Associations met a signiﬁcance of S x lOPg and corres-
ponded to a single gene.

3 RESULTS

We assessed connectedness of 3724 proteins causative of
Mendelian diseases that have been previously classiﬁed to 18
phenotypic classes (Goh et ai., 2007). We used the InWeb
(Lage et ai., 2007) network to calculate mean communicabilities
of proteins causing neurological and cardiovascular disease
to those of other classes. Our metric identiﬁed increased connect-
edness among proteins within classes than between classes and
outperformed shortest path (Fig. 1A, Supplementary Fig. S1).
Our method similarly identiﬁed interactions among gene
products associated with type 1 diabetes (Fig. 1B).

4 CONCLUSIONS

Network communicability provides advantages over alternative
metrics because it retains topology information, lends itself to
set-based analysis and is easy to represent with univariate scores.
It outperforms shortest path in a variety of situations. Overall,
our metric may prove useful in the analysis of a variety of
biological networks, and our package provides a straightforward
approach to computation even on large networks.

Connectedness among proteins causing neurologic phenotypes does not
appear greater than to proteins in other classes by shortest path; however,
on average, these same proteins are more connected to each other than to
other class proteins by ﬁnite network communicability. Interestingly, pro-
teins of the psychiatric class form the second strongest connections. (B)
Protein products of genes with signiﬁcant associations to type 1 diabetes

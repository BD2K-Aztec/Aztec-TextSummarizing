ABSTRACT

Motivation: Multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) are widely used
approaches in bioinformatics to carry out other tasks such as structure
predictions, biological function analyses or phylogenetic modeling.
However, current tools usually provide partially optimal alignments,
as each one is focused on specific biological features. Thus, the
same set of sequences can produce different alignments, above all
when sequences are less similar. Consequently, researchers and
biologists do not agree about which is the most suitable way to evalu-
ate MSAs. Recent evaluations tend to use more complex scores
including further biological features. Among them, 3D structures are
increasingly being used to evaluate alignments. Because structures
are more conserved in proteins than sequences, scores with structural
information are better suited to evaluate more distant relationships
between sequences.

Results: The proposed multiobjective algorithm, based on the non-
dominated sorting genetic algorithm, aims to jointly optimize three
objectives: STRIKE score, non -gaps percentage and totally consen/ed
columns. It was significantly assessed on the BAliBASE benchmark
according to the Kruskal—Wallis test (P<0.01). This algorithm also
outperforms other aligners, such as ClustalW, Multiple Sequence
Alignment Genetic Algorithm (MSA-GA), PRRP, DIALIGN, Hidden
Markov Model Training (HMMT), Pattern-Induced Multi-sequence
Alignment (PIMA), MULTIALIGN, Sequence Alignment Genetic
Algorithm (SAGA), PILEUP, Rubber Band Technique Genetic
Algorithm (RBT—GA) and Vertical Decomposition Genetic Algorithm
(VDGA), according to the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (P<0.05),
whereas it shows results not significantly different to 3D—COFFEE
(P> 0.05) with the advantage of being able to use less structures.
Structural information is included within the objective function to
evaluate more accurately the obtained alignments.

1 INTRODUCTION

Multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) are widely used strategies
in current molecular biology. These approaches are often used
for homology transfer (Doolittle, 1981; Fitch, 1966), where
poorly characterized sequences are compared with well-studied
homologs from typical model organisms. MSA strategies have
traditionally been applied to researches in phylogenetic analyses,
structural modeling, functional predictions or sequence database
searching (Bacon and Anderson, 1986). MSA tools have also
been implemented in applications to predict protein structures
and interactions (Chou and Fasman, 1978; Taylor and Thorn-
ton, 1984), mutations (Schneider et al., 1986) or to reconstruct
phylogenetic trees (Feng and Doolittle, 1987). The development
of novel experimental techniques, such as next-generation
sequencing and high-throughput experiments, has prompted a
great demand of MSA tools. Because these techniques provide
mainly new nucleotide sequences and their subsequent products,
MSA tools usually help to extract biological meanings from such
information. Current MSA tools are capable of dealing with and
efﬁciently analyze the massive amount of information generated
by these former techniques by using advanced computational
approaches based on well-known artificial intelligence and ma-
chine-learning algorithms (hidden Markov models (HMMs),
support vector machines, etc). Besides, MSA methodologies
also take advantage of functional, structural and genomic infor-
mation to obtain more accurate alignments in a reasonable time
(Kemena and Notredame, 2009). Taking all these ideas into con-
sideration, MSAs are becoming one of the most powerful and
essential procedures of analysis in bioinformatics (Li and Homer,
2010).

Traditionally, several strategies have been applied to align
multiple sequences, mainly classiﬁed as progressive algorithms
(Hogeweg and Hesper, 1984) or consistency-based methods
(Gotoh, 1990). Both approaches were also combined with
other relevant computational strategies to obtain more accurate
alignments. Recently, more sophisticated tools in MSA have

Optimizing MSAs using a GA based on three objectives

 

included additional data referring to proteins (domains, struc-
tures or homologies) to align sequences (O’Sullivan et al., 2004;
Pei and Grishin, 2007). Such additional features enrich the align-
ment information building more realistic solutions. However, the
consumed time is excessive and improvements are just relevant in
speciﬁc cases with less related sequences. Moreover, these meth-
ods can be run when additional features are unavailable or
unknown, though they could provide inefficient alignments.

Genetic algorithms (GAs) are also widely used to build MSAs.
GAs are helpful in MSA because they can be implemented inde-
pendently of the objective function (Naznin et al., 2011). Thus,
GA algorithm can deﬁne multiple evaluations regardless of any
modiﬁcation in the optimization procedure. GAs can also be
easily parallelized to signiﬁcantly reduce the computational
time. Consequently, several methodologies, such as SAGA
(Notredame and Higgins, 1996), MSA-GA (Gondro and King-
horn, 2007), RBT-GA (Taheri and Zomaya, 2009) or VDGA
(Naznin et al., 2011), have already applied GAs to build MSAs.

Although there are many MSA methodologies, they usually
achieve different solutions for the same set of sequences because
each strategy is focused on speciﬁc biological features.
Consequently, there is no consensus about which method
builds more accurate alignments (Nuin et al., 2006; Sierk et al.,
2010). Besides, these MSA tools could achieve suboptimal solu-
tions where specific regions within the alignments are more ac-
curate than others depending on the biological features found at
these particular regions. These divergences have also a negative
inﬂuence on subsequent phylogenetic analyses, as wrong phylo-
genetic trees are obtained when alignments are inaccurate (Wong
et al., 2008). For this reason, some other methods (Redelings and
Suchard, 2005; Ronquist and Huelsenbeck, 2003) take advantage
of jointly optimizing both phylogenetic trees and alignments.
These methods aim to avoid the bias generated by guide trees
in progressive methods, though they do not still achieve good
performances in terms of structure. Therefore, the choice of the
most suitable aligner is an essential problem, which has not been
completely solved yet.

Another challenge in MSA is to provide an efﬁcient evaluation
method to measure the alignment accuracy. MSA strategies have
usually applied well-known matrices, such as point accepted mu-
tation (PAM) (Dayhoff et al., 1978) or BLOSUM (Henikoff and
Henikoff, 1992), which only consider nucleotide or amino acid
information to evaluate every aligned pair of residues. However,
when the number of sequences increases or longer and more
distant sequences are included, alignments are more likely to
be inaccurate using such scores (Liu et al., 2009). In these
cases, additional information is necessary to complement align-
ment evaluations. Therefore, current scores are increasingly
using supplementary information, such as homologies or protein
structures. Thus, some approaches can beneﬁt from homology
proﬁles provided, e.g. by PSI-BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997), to
evaluate alignments. Additionally, as structures are evolutionar-
ily more conserved than sequences in proteins, structural infor-
mation also provides more distant relationships between
sequences (Kemena and Notredame, 2009). For instance,
Kececioglu et al. (2010) provided a novel scoring scheme to
evaluate MSAs from their predicted secondary structures.
Other scores, such as contact accepted mutation (Lin et al.,
2003) and STRIKE (Kemena et al., 2011) scores also estimated

the molecular contacts from protein structures to calculate align-
ment accuracies.

In this article, a novel multiobjective genetic approach has
been developed. This method is named Multiobjective
Optimizer for Sequence Alignments based on Structural Evalu-
ations (MO-SAStrE). It takes advantage of three objectives
that are used to evaluate alignments generated by the GA:
STRIKE score (Kemena et al., 2011), totally conserved (TC)
columns and percentage of non-gaps. Alignments are first
coded in a novel representation, which is useful for applying
efﬁcient mutation and crossover operators. This algorithm is im-
plemented through the well-known multiobjective non-domi-
nated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) approach. It is
assessed by the BAliBASE benchmark V3.0 (Thompson et al.,
2005). Alignments from MO—SAStrE are ﬁnally compared with
results shown by other known genetic and non-genetic alignment
algorithms.

2 METHODS

2.1 Input sequence dataset

The proposed multiobjective algorithm must be tested through a dataset
deﬁned by several input sequences. The BAliBASE dataset (v3.0)
(Thompson et al., 2005) deﬁnes a well-known benchmark to standardize
the comparison of sequence alignment results. It oonsists of a group of
protein sequences that are properly prepared to be aligned by MSA al-
gorithms. The dataset includes 218 sets of sequences, which were manu-
ally extracted from the protein data bank (PDB) (Berman et al., 2000). It
is organized in ﬁve reference subsets, named References or Ref., accord-
ing to their sequence families or similarities. The ﬁrst reference subset
(Ref.1) is separated in two versions (Ref.1 v.1 and Ref.1 v.2). The ﬁrst
version (Ref.1 v.1) includes less similar sequences, which are interesting
because they are more difﬁcult to be accurately aligned.

BAliBASE also provides a set of handmade alignments (gold standard)
to evaluate alignments obtained by other tools. Thus, this benchmark
calculates BAliscore, a standard Sum-of-Pairs score to evaluate align-
ments compared with their gold standard. Here, the BAliscore evaluation
was used to compare the MO-SAStrE performance against other similar
MSA methodologies.

2.2 Alignment approaches

In this article, eight representative MSA tools were selected to obtain
initial alignments. Both progressive and consistency-based methods
were included in these representative tools (see a summary in the
Supplementary Table S1). Among progressive algorithms, ClustalW
(Thompson et al., 1994), Muscle (Edgar, 2004), Kalign (Lassmann and
Sonnhammer, 2005), Mafft (Katoh et al., 2002) and RetAlign (Szabo
et al., 2010) were chosen in the proposed optimization. ClustalW designs
a clustering tree algorithm to ﬁnd the ﬁnal alignment through a distance
score matrix and a gap weighting scheme. Muscle develops a three-stage
strategy to reﬁne alignments and to align faster. Kalign uses the
Wu-Manber string-matching algorithm to improve the measurement of
distances within a classical progressive approach. Mafft reduces the com-
putational cost by identifying common homologies through the fast
Fourier transform. Finally, RetAlign applies a progressive corner cutting
algorithm to identify optimal and suboptimal alignments in a network.
Besides, three additional algorithms based on consistency were also
included in the optimization: T-Coffee (Notredame et al., 2000), fast
statistical alignment (FSA) (Bradley et al., 2009) and ProbCons (Do
et al., 2005). T-Coffee stores in a library the number of times each pair
of residues matched in previously built pairwise alignments. T-Coffee also

evaluates such pairwise alignments in regard to third sequences. The FSA
compares pairwise alignments by a statistical analysis framework. FSA
estimates the insertion and deletion processes through a pair of HMMs.
This method provides a faster procedure, but it usually achieves less
accurate alignments owing to an excessive number of gaps. Finally,
ProbCons also includes HMMs to optimize the classical scoring schemes.
It applies a biphasic penalty procedure to penalize gaps and mismatches
in alignments. Methods based on HMM proﬁles, such as FSA or
ProbCons, usually outperform other alignment methods, especially in
terms of the structure-superposition quality (Kemena and Notredame,
2009). The 218 sets of sequences proposed by BAliBASE were then
aligned using these eight programs. All of them were run with their de-
fault parameters, though they can be modiﬁed according to the user
preferences. These speciﬁc initial alignments were chosen because they
were quickly obtained and might be improved. In case more accurate
initial alignments were provided, MO-SAStrE could even return better
output alignments. Moreover, the efﬁciency of including previously ob-
tained solutions to build the initial set in GAs has widely been shown in
the literature (Dasgupta et al., 2009; Tsujimoto et al., 2009).

2.3 Multiobjective algorithm

MSAs can be deﬁned as multiobjective problems as there is no consensus
about how alignments should be adequately evaluated and several fea-
tures are currently being considered for this purpose. Additionally,
including several suitable objectives provides more ﬂexibility in the opti-
mization procedure. Consequently, MO-SAStrE is implemented as a GA
including three different evaluations: 3D structure, TC columns and gaps
in alignments. The multiobjective approach is developed through the
NSGA-II scheme (Deb et al., 2002), as it is a classical and recognized
method that produces efﬁcient solutions. NSGA-II provides the subset of
all optimal solutions, named Pareto front, by using the non-dominated
sorting strategy. That is, the Pareto front includes those solutions that
cannot be compared among them because there is no one that outper-
forms any other considering the three objectives. This feature is known as
non-dominance relationship. Both Pareto front and dominance concepts
are widely described in the Supplementary Material.

The MO-SAStrE procedure is designed as shown in Figure 1. First,
alignments from input methodologies are included in the initial popula-
tion. The coded alignments belonging to a population are called individ-
uals. The population is then ﬁlled to N individuals (where N deﬁnes the
population size) by using the crossover operator. Subsequently, the popu-
lation is extended by the mutation and crossover operators, according to
their assigned probabilities pc and pm, respectively (see the ‘Operators’
stage in Fig. 1). These operators are generally deﬁned to build new indi-
viduals by combining already existing ones. The best individuals are then
selected from the extended population to be included in the new gener-
ation. This selection is carried out progressively, taking the optimal non-
dominated solutions (Pareto fronts) from the current population. If all
individuals in the last included Pareto front (F, in Fig. 1) cannot be
added, they must be selected according to the crowding distance (see
the ‘Selection’ subsection for details). Finally, when the total number of
generations (G) is reached or the Pareto front does not change in con-
secutive generations, the optimal Pareto front in the last population is
returned as the set of optimized alignments. This implementation of the
NSGA-II approach was taken from the Global Optimization toolbox of ®
Matlab (version R2010b). Individual codiﬁcation, operators and ﬁtness
functions were own-designed for this speciﬁc purpose.

2.3.] Codification Previous GAs in MSA tools (Notredame and
Higgins, 1996; Taheri and Zomaya, 2009) coded alignments using the
classical representation: the standard alphabet for amino acids and the
‘-’ symbol for gaps (Fig. 2a). However, that representation could lead to
more complex and inefﬁcient operators. For this reason, a novel codiﬁ-
cation is proposed here. Alignments are represented as a matrix where

tion of a MSA. (b) Alignment coded by a matrix of integer values: pos-
itions in their sequences (amino acids) and positions of the last amino
acid denoted with a negative sign (gaps)

two conditions are fulﬁlled: (i) amino acids are coded by their positions in
the sequence to which they belong; (ii) gaps are coded by the position of
the last amino acid in the sequence where they belong, but with a negative
value. Input alignments are coded before they are included in this tool.
The whole optimization is done by using coded alignments (individuals).
After the optimization ends, individuals are decoded and therefore re-
turned to the standard alignment representation. An example of the pro-
posed codification is shown in Figure 2. This representation aims to easily
identify positions where the crossover operator will be applied. It avoids
possible mistakes in the subsequent crossover performance, providing
signiﬁcant improvements in the alignment management (see details in
the ‘Operators’ subsection).

Optimizing MSAs using a GA based on three objectives

 

2.3.2 Operators MO-SAStrE includes the two standard operators in
GAs: mutation and crossover. These operations are applied to a subset of
randomly chosen alignments from the population according to the prob-
abilities pm and [76, respectively. They can then include new alignments not
considered before. These operators are run for each generation in the
optimization procedure. Because sequences in alignments cannot be
altered, some modiﬁcations must be introduced in the classical implemen-
tation of both operators.

The mutation operator only mutates gaps, to keep the order of amino
acids. A random set of closed gaps are then shifted to another random
position in the same sequence. Two important aspects are introduced
with such deﬁnition: ﬁrst, new variants of alignments not taken into
account until now can be introduced; second, columns containing only
gaps can be removed, thus reducing the number of gaps. A speciﬁc
example of the mutation operation is shown in Figure 3.

The crossover operator is designed as a one-point crossover. Firstly,
the algorithm randomly selects one column from one of the parents,
splitting it into two blocks. The same selected positions from this
column are also found in the second parent, but not necessarily in the
same column. Finally, selected blocks are crossed between these two par-
ents. To match blocks from both parents, those undeﬁned positions are
ﬁlled with gaps. Thus, it can be assured that the obtained children do not
alter their sequences. The complete operation is graphically explained in
Figure 4. The crossover operator is the most important issue in outper-
forming input methodologies. Because alignments can be more accurate
in some sectors than in others, this operation is essential for the optimiza-
tion purpose. Therefore, crossed children could assemble the best sections
from different parents, providing a more accurate alignment.

2.3.3 Evaluation Because MO-SAStrE is designed as a multiobjective
algorithm, three different scores are included to evaluate each alignment:
STRIKE score, percentage of TC columns and percentage of non-gaps.

The STRIKE score (Kemena et al., 2011) is a novel index for calculat-
ing alignment accuracies by using at least one known structure. The
structural information is retrieved from the PDB (Berman et al., 2000).
According to such a structure, the contacts between amino acids in the
sequence are estimated. For the remaining sequences, the pairs of amino
acids aligned in the same positions as the previously estimated contacts
are retrieved. Such pairs of amino acids are then scored according to a
novel scoring matrix provided by the STRIKE authors (Kemena et al.,
2011). In case of several available structures, the STRIKE score is sep-
arately calculated for each structure and the averaged score is ﬁnally
provided. This evaluation permits to identify the accuracy in the align-
ments better than other well-known scores such as BLOSUM (Henikoff
and Henikoff, 1992) or PAM (Dayhoff et al., 1978). Moreover, the
STRIKE score clearly outperforms the other evaluations when sequences
are evolutionarily more distant. STRIKE score also shows a strong non-
parametric correlation with the classical BAliscore. That is, both

Fig. 3. Mutation procedure. Closed gaps are randomly chosen and
shifted to another position. Full columns of gaps are then removed if
they are found

BAliscore and STRIKE usually identify the same alignment as the best
one when two different alignments are compared (in ~79% of cases)
(Kemena et al., 2011).

The second ﬁtness function, the percentage of TC column, takes into
account the number of columns that are completely aligned with exactly
the same amino acids. Some progressive methodologies usually favor
partial alignment but not complete columns (Mirarab and Warnow,
2011). The number of complete columns is a widely accepted evaluation
applied by several methodologies (Edgar, 2004; Thompson et al., 2005).
Complete columns also indicate more conserved or special regions in
sequences.

Finally, as commented above, some methodologies usually overuse
gaps to increase identities in alignments (Nozaki and Bellgard, 2005).
Thus, the third ﬁtness function is measured as the number of amino
acids in the sequences with respect to the number of gaps (percentage
of non-gaps). Consequently, the proposed optimization tries to reduce the
number of gaps, building more compact and realistic alignments.

Therefore, MO-SAStrE aims to optimize alignments according to a
novel evaluation based on conserved structural information in sequences,
but also reducing the number of gaps and keeping fully conserved sec-
tions. These three objectives must then be maximized to obtain more
accurate alignments.

2.3.4 Selection The selection procedure is well-defined by the pro-
posed NSGA-II algorithm (Deb et al., 2002). For each generation, the
extended population (parents and children) is classiﬁed into different
Pareto fronts to obtain a non-dominated sorting (F1, F2, . . . , F, in
Fig. 1). This procedure selects those individuals that are not outper-
formed by any other regarding the three objectives. Then, the best non-
dominated Pareto front is progressively included within the next
generation. Finally, when the new population is ﬁlled with the required
number of individuals, the remaining Pareto fronts are discarded. A spe-
cial case of this selection is the last considered front (F,), as it is possible
that only some individuals can be included within the next generation. In
this case, NSGA-II proposed to include those individuals located in less
explored areas or, in other words, distant individuals. The last individuals
are then selected according to their distances to the nearest individuals.
This measure is called the crowding distance (see formulation in the
Supplementary Material).

2.4 Performance assessment

MO-SAStrE is deﬁned as a stochastic procedure because the algorithm
converges to different solutions when it is applied several times to the
same problem. Consequently, several runs of the same problem must be
carried out to statistically evaluate its performance. Zitzler et al. (2008)
proposed several indicators to assess multiobjective stochastic optimizers:
the hypervolume indicator (HV), dominance rankings or the attainment
function method. The main goal of these quality indicators is to reduce
the provided scores (three objectives) of multiple optimal solutions
(Pareto front) to one single score, making the algorithm easier to
assess. Thus, the HV (Zitzler et al., 2008) was selected to validate the
optimization provided by the multiobjective algorithm (see formal deﬁn-
ition of hypervolume in the Supplementary Material).

However, hypervolume is not the only strategy taken into account in
the MO-SAStrE assessment. Because each problem was run several times,
initial hypervolume values must also be compared with output hypervo-
lume values provided by MO-SAStrE. Non-parametric tests are usually
applied to validate these stochastic approaches (Conover, 1999). To
assess this algorithm, the classical test proposed by Kruskal and Wallis
(1952) is used. This KruskaliWallis test assesses whether there are sig-
niﬁcant differences between initial alignments and the optimized ones for
independent repetitions in terms of the three objectives. For MO-SAStrE
assessment, the initial and optimized hypervolume values are then
compared.

Finally, the performance of MO-SAStrE is compared with other gen-
etic methods, namely SAGA (Notredame and Higgins, 1996), MSA-GA
(Gondro and Kinghorn, 2007), RBT-GA (Taheri and Zomaya, 2009) and
VDGA (Naznin et al., 2011). Other known non-genetic aligners are also
included in these comparisons, namely ClustalW (Thompson et al., 1994),
MultAlign (Barton and Sternberg, 1987), PIMA (Smith and Smith, 1992),
PILEUPS (Devereux et al., 1984), Dialign (Morgenstern et al., 1996),
HMMT (Eddy, 1995), PRRP (Gotoh, 1996). 3D-COFFEE (O’Sullivan
et al., 2004) was also included to compare MO-SAStrE against another
aligner using structural information. To compare all of them, the authors
in VDGA provided BAliscore results from 60 different problems in
BAliBASE 2.0, which were also included in MSA-GA and RBT-GA
publications. However, as BAliBASE 3.0 is applied here, a subset of 20
problems included in both versions of BAliBASE is taken. Then, MO-
SAStrE is statistically compared for these 20 datasets through another
non-parametric analysis, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (W ilcoxon, 1945).
The Wilcoxon test provides pairwise comparison between each two meth-
ods to validate if their mean ranks are signiﬁcantly different. Therefore, it
can be determined whether MO-SAStrE outperforms other similar tools.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Selecting parameters

To conﬁgure the proposed multiobjective algorithm, five differ-
ent parameters (population size, number of generations, prob-
abilities of mutation and crossover and repetitions per problem)
must be provided. These parameters were selected according to
the standard values used by GAs (Eiben and Smith, 2008)
(Supplementary Table S2). First, the population size was set to
100 alignments (individuals), as that same population size was
also included in methods that are being compared, such as
SAGA (Notredame and Higgins, 1996) or VDGA (Naznin
et al., 2011).

On the other hand, although MO-SAStrE includes a stop con-
dition, 500 generations were deﬁned to assure the convergence
and optimization of the alignments. Once these two parameters
were set, the operator probabilities were determined. Because

crossover is considered the main operator for this optimization,
it is assumed that its probability must be the same or higher than
the mutation’s one. Consequently, the following pair of prob-
abilities 8(%20% was set for crossover and mutation, respect-
ively. These probabilities values are a standard combination
for GAs (Eiben and Smith, 2008). This parameter conﬁguration
was validated with a subset of 20 BAliBASE problems.

Finally, as the proposed optimizer is deﬁned as a stochastic
procedure, each problem must be run several times. In this case,
each of the 218 problems was optimized 10 times. The same
number of runs was also included in VDGA (Naznin et al.,
2011) and RBT-GA (Taheri and Zomaya, 2009). A total of
2180 Pareto fronts were then obtained (10 solutions by 218
problems).

3.2 Optimization procedure

Firstly, the eight input alignments for each BAliBASE dataset
were introduced in the MO—SAStrE algorithm. These alignments
were progressively assembled into other optimized alignments as
shown in the Supplementary Figure S3. Thus, the built solutions
included partial alignments from previous methodologies and
several gap shifts.

The multiobjective procedure returns the subset of non-domi-
nated alignments (Pareto front). These obtained alignments are
equally good and it is not possible to decide which one is more
accurate according to the three objectives. Therefore, the selec-
tion of the best alignment only depends on the objective the users
consider more useful regarding the speciﬁc aligned sequences. In
case the alignment with the best STRIKE score was chosen, it
would obtain more quality according to the sequence structures.
In addition, those alignments with higher STRIKE scores are
usually improved in terms of BAliscore (Kemena et al., 2011).
Otherwise, whether the alignment with the highest percentage of
non-gaps is selected, a more compact and realistic alignment
could be obtained. Finally, a higher number of TC columns in

Optimizing MSAs using a GA based on three objectives

 

alignments provides a better quality in terms of the evolutionary
homologies among sequences. For this reason, the Pareto fronts
are hard to compare as multiple non-dominated solutions are
considered and they should be assessed according to their three
evaluations. For instance, Table 1 shows the objective values of
MO-SAStrE alignments with regard to the eight inputs for the
‘laab’ problem in the Ref.1 v.1. In this case, the MO—SAStrE
alignments outperform the input methodologies in at least one
objective according to these evaluations. The same problem was
also graphically compared through the initial and optimized
Pareto fronts as shown in Figure 5. The optimized front achieves
higher values in the three objectives than the initial one. The
optimization procedure applied to the ‘laab’ problem was car-
ried out for the 218 problems. Averages and standard deviations
of the three objectives and the BAliBASE score (BAliscore) in
the complete dataset are shown for each alignment methodology
in the Supplementary Table S3. Similarly, the computing time
taken by each methodology is depicted in the Supplementary
Figure S4. Here, it can be observed that MO-SAStrE almost
always achieves the best values in all the three objectives at the
expense of a higher computing time. Despite these time differ-
ences, computing times obtained by MO—SAStrE are acceptable
taking into account that the simplest and quickest input meth-
odologies were chosen to be subsequently optimized.
Additionally, it is shown in the Supplementary Table S3 that
MO-SAStrE also outperforms the input methodologies in
terms of the BAliscore.

3.3 Hypervolume analysis

To formally validate the results shown above, the HV was cal-
culated as suggested by Zitzler et al. (2008) for multiobjective
problems (see details in the ‘Performance Assessment’ subsec-
tion). Because the three independent objectives must be maxi-
mized here, better alignments lead to lower HV values (the

Note: Results are shown for the ‘laab’ dataset in Ref.1 v.1. Evaluations for input

to simplify.

higher objectives, the less covered space in HV). Previously, the
three objectives were normalized to the range [0, 1] to give them
the same weight. Then, HV could be interpreted as a measure of
quality, which takes into consideration the three proposed ob-
jectives simultaneously. The HV was measured regarding a ref-
erence point (bounding point) (see Supplementary Material for
details). Previously, it was assured that each problem and its HV
value successfully converged to an optimized solution (the con-
vergences of four different problems are shown in the Supple-
mentary Figure S5). Subsequently, the HV values from the initial
Pareto front (eight input alignments) can be compared with those
obtained by MO—SAStrE. The HV comparisons were applied to
the 218 problems, showing strictly better outcomes with M0-
SAStrE in all of them. That is, the HV values obtained by
MO—SAStrE from the 10 runs of each problem always outper-
formed the initial HV values. These results also showed that the
optimized alignments achieved an average improvement of
63.01% according to HV indicators. Such an improvement
even increases to 70.34% when sequences are less related and
alignments become more difﬁcult (Ref.1 v.1 subset in
BAliBASE). A summary of the improvement associated to
each subset in BAliBASE is shown in Table 2. Nevertheless,
there were two problems where the improvements did not
reach the 10%: ‘laab’ and ‘2trx’ in Ref.2. Because these two
datasets belong to a BAliBASE subset with higher similarity
percentages, the initial alignments were already accurate. These
speciﬁc problems also included some special features such as
higher number of sequences or highly divergent lengths,
making more difﬁcult the optimization.

3.4 Statistical assessment

The MO-SAStrE optimization has been validated both graphic-
ally and in terms of hypervolume. However, these validations are
not enough for the proposed approach, as it is necessary to know
not only if alignments have been improved, but also if the im-
provement is statistically signiﬁcant. To study that signiﬁcance,
the KruskaliWallis test was applied. The relevance of the 218
solutions was determined from the 10 runs per problem. This test
provided P—Values to confirm whether the output HV values were

statistically different than the input ones. The signiﬁcance level
used to reject the null hypothesis in the 218 problems and to
validate the improvement was set to a = 0.01.

According to the proposed KruskaliWallis test, the complete
dataset was considered signiﬁcantly better, even those problems
where improvements did not exceed 10%. Consequently, MO-
SAStrE successfully optimized the 218 alignments with regard to
the input methodologies because the null hypothesis was rejected
in all of them. In addition, MO—SAStrE also returned better
BAliscore results than the input alignments (Supplementary
Table S3).

3.5 Comparison with other MSA methodologies

Finally, MO—SAStrE was compared with other genetic MSA
methods, namely SAGA (Notredame and Higgins, 1996),
MSA-GA (Gondro and Kinghorn, 2007), RBT-GA (Taheri
and Zomaya, 2009) or DVGA (Naznin et al., 2011). Other
non-genetic methodologies, which were also included in compari-
sons of previous genetic approaches, were also considered:
ClustalW (Thompson et al., 1994), MultAlign (Barton and
Sternberg, 1987), PRRP (Gotoh, 1996), PIMA (Smith and
Smith, 1992), PILEUP (Devereux et al., 1984), Dialign (Morgen-
stern et al., 1996), HMMT (Eddy, 1995). These algorithms were
assessed with a subset of problems in BAliBASE 2.0. However,
as BAliBASE 3.0 was applied here, a subset of 20 problems
included in both versions was selected. The 3D—COFFEE algo-
rithm (O’Sullivan et al., 2004) was also added to compare MO-

SAStrE against another important aligner using structural
information.

Firstly, MO—SAStrE was compared with those methods
included in MSA-GA and VDGA publications and 3D-
COFFEE. MSA-GA deﬁned two different conﬁgurations de-
pending on whether a prealign procedure was included. Also,
VDGA was conﬁgured according to the number of parts in
which each sequence was decomposed: Decomp_2, Decomp_3
or Decomp_4. Both tools were assessed against ClustalW. They
included a set of 26 problems. MSA-GA and VDGA ran each of
these problems five and ten times, respectively. The best result
for each problem was then reported. Finally, the proposed solu-
tions were evaluated with BAliscore. Here, a subset of eight
problems, which were also included in BAliBASE V3.0, was con-
sidered to compare with MO—SAStrE. The BAliscore was also
provided to measure the alignment accuracies. Additionally, 3D-
COFFEE was also included to compare MO—SAStrE against
another aligner using structural data. Both MO—SAStrE and
3D-COFFEE were run with all structures available in the
PDB database for each speciﬁc set of sequences. Consequently,
Table 3 shows the BAliscore results obtained from these meth-
odologies (the best BAliscore values are highlighted in bold).
From these eight problems, MO—SAStrE achieved a total of
seven more accurate alignments against MSA-GA and VDGA,
while it outperforms 3D-COFFEE in ﬁve out of the eight prob-
lems. Speciﬁcally, MSA-GA with the prealign procedure and
VDGA Decomp_4 are better than MO-SAStrE in one case,
mainly the ‘luky’ from Ref.1 v.1 subset. However,
3D-COFFEE achieves more accurate alignments in three Ref .1
V1 problems: ‘lped’, ‘luky’ and ‘2myr’. MO-SAStrE generally
showed close BAliscore values to MSA-GA and VDGA but
more distant than 3D-COFFEE in those problems where it
does not achieve the most accurate alignment.

MO-SAStrE was also compared with SAGA, RBT-GA and,
again, VDGA and 3D-COFFEE. Additionally, this comparison
included other strategies used in the VDGA and RBT-GA as-
sessment, namely PRRP, ClustalW, Dialign, PIMA, HMMT
and PILEUP. Both RBT-GA and VDGA applied 10 independ-
ent runs for each problem and the best alignments were taken for
their comparison. The subset proposed by RBT-GA and VDGA
contained 34 problems from BAliBASE 2.0. Here, 12 of these
problems were considered, as they must be included in both

versions of BAliBASE. The obtained BAliscore results are pre-
sented in Table 4. From this table, it is observed that MO-
SAStrE achieves one of the two best results in 10 out of 12
problems. VDGA outperforms MO—SAStrE in three problems
distributed into its three decompositions, while 3D-COFFEE
achieves better alignments in four problems. In this second com-
parison, the alignments where MO—SAStrE achieves worse re-
sults are closer to the best accuracy than those alignments
proposed by other methodologies (excepting 3D-COFFEE
whose alignments are similar).

Finally, both comparisons (Tables 3 and 4) were joined to
estimate the significance of the MO—SAStrE improvement.
Speciﬁcally, the BAliscore results were compared with the
Wilcoxon non-parametric statistical test (Table 5). According
to the obtained P—Values, MO—SAStrE shows signiﬁcant im-
provements over the other methods, except 3D-COFFEE. This

improvement is even more relevant comparing with ClustalW
and VDGA, as a larger number of problems (20 alignments)
were used. Regarding the comparison with 3D-COFFEE, both
3D-COFFEE and MO—SAStrE provide similar alignments, as
none achieves a statistically significant improvement against
the other (Wilcoxon test, P>0.05). Nevertheless, MO—SAStrE
includes some additional advantages with respect to 3D-
COFFEE. Firstly, MO—SAStrE is able to work with only one
structure, whereas 3D-COFFEE requires at least two structures
to build the structure superposition. Therefore, the alignment
accuracy from 3D-COFFEE directly depends on the number
of available structures, making it less useful when just a few
structures are available. Additionally, MO—SAStrE provides
more ﬂexibility owing to the fact that it includes other optimiza-
tion criteria (multiobjective approach) to evaluate and improve
the alignments in addition to structural information.

3.6 PDB structure availability

We acknowledge that one of the main drawbacks of the pro-
posed approach could be the limited availability of PDB struc-
tures. However, the pivotal relevance of structures to accomplish
well-annotated sequences is beyond dispute. Thus, PDB is cur-
rently making a major effort to accurately annotate proteins’
structures, which has been translated into an exponential increase
in the past 10 years (87 089 structures in 2012). It is also known
that current databases have admitted this relevance and they are
currently being updated to include as many PDB structures as
possible. For instance, the Pfam database (Punta et al., 2012),
which identiﬁes a number of families related by common func-
tional domains, considers that the use of structural information
will help to improve domain deﬁnitions and to increase coverage
of sequences included in other databases. Thus, Pfam database
(release 24.0) (Punta et al., 2012) already includes some structural
annotation in almost 50% of its families, which represents the
95% of the known PDB structures.

Additionally, it is important to highlight that the main goal of
MSA tools is to compare unknown sequences with those well-
annotated ones to infer several biological features of such

sequences. Then, at least one well-annotated sequence should be
included in MSAs, including at least some structural informa-
tion. Anyway, to make the proposed approach more robust,
MO—SAStrE implements an alternative objective for those
cases where sequences lack any PDB structures. In those cases,
the STRIKE objective is substituted by an easier evaluation such
as the PAM250 score (Dayhoff et al., 1978). Although this alter-
native is not the main goal here, it was also checked that the
multiobjective optimization using the PAM250 score could also
be effective.

4 CONCLU$ONS

Currently, MSAs are an open issue for researchers. Aligners
must be continually improved, as they are essential in the ana-
lysis of huge amount of data provided by next-generation
sequencing and high-throughput experiments. For this reason,
the most efﬁcient computational techniques are fundamental to
reduce the cost of analyzing new information and to improve the
obtained accuracy.

A complete algorithm called MO—SAStrE was proposed to
optimize MSAs. This algorithm was developed through the mul-
tiobjective approach NSGA-II, specially based on a structure
evaluation (STRIKE score). Then, this algorithm takes advan-
tage of a wider range of optimization measures than other similar
methodologies. Although this is not the main purpose, the
PAM250 score could also be applied for the ﬁrst objective in
case of sequences not having structures available. For this algo-
rithm, alignments previously obtained from eight methodologies
(mainly progressive and consistency-based ones) were coded
using a novel representation and own-designed crossover/
mutation procedures. The obtained alignments were built as an
ensemble of the best aligned parts from these solutions to adjust
the sequences as precisely as possible. The results for this ap-
proach showed that the alignments could generally be improved
without the application of more time-consuming aligners. A
complete set of problems from BAliBASE 3.0 was then applied.
The HV and the KruskaliWallis test confirmed that MO-SAStrE
achieves signiﬁcantly optimized alignments with regard to the
input methodologies. Additionally, comparisons with other gen-
etic and non-genetic approaches showed that MO—SAStrE can
provide more accurate alignments according to the BAliscore
results.

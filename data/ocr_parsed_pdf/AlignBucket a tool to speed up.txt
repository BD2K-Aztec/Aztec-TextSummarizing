Abstract

Motivation: The next—generation sequencing era requires reliable, fast and efficient approaches for
the accurate annotation ofthe ever—increasing number of biological sequences and their variations.
Transfer of annotation upon similarity search is a standard approach. The procedure of all—against—
all protein comparison is a preliminary step of different available methods that annotate sequences
based on information already present in databases. Given the actual volume of sequences, meth—
ods are necessary to pre—process data to reduce the time of sequence comparison.

Results: We present an algorithm that optimizes the partition of a large volume of sequences (the
whole database) into sets where sequence length values (in residues) are constrained depending
on a bounded minimal and expected alignment coverage. The idea is to optimally group protein
sequences according to their length, and then computing the all—against—all sequence alignments
among sequences that fall in a selected length range. We describe a mathematically optimal solu—
tion and we show that our method leads to a 5—fold speed—up in real world cases.

1 Introduction

‘All-against-all’ sequence alignments in protein datasets are rou-
tinely performed with programs such as BLAST (Altschul et (11.,
1990) or dynamic programming approaches (Needleman and
Wunsch, 1970). By this, sequences group into subsets of sequence
identity values that are important in several applications, including
transfer of structural and functional features between protein se-
quences (for details see www.uniprot.org/program/ and www.ehi.
ac.uk/GOA/ElectronicAnnotationMethods). Proteins that share at
least some 30% of sequence identity may overlap in their three-
dimensional structures (Chothia and Lesk, 1986), while proteins
sharing at least some 60% of sequence identity are likely to share

also similar functions (Rost, 2002; Tian and Skolnick, 2003). It is
also important to consider the relative length of the pairwise aligned
sequences before transferring annotations (Devos and Valencia,
2001). Multidomain proteins are less functionally conserved than
single-domain ones (Hegyi and Gerstein, 2001) and methods based
on transfer of function after homology search can group proteins
with different functions in the same cluster. Therefore, both se-
quence identity values and the percentage of overlapping positions
over the alignment length (coverage) were constrained in developing
methods for annotation prohlems (Miele et (11., 2011; Piovesan
et (11., 2011, 2013). Evolutionary studies include alignments in the
early stage of their workflow (Vilella et (11., 2009; Waterhouse et 111.,

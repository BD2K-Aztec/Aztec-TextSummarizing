EricScript to identify chimeric transcripts in RNA-seq data

 

where X,- is the relative position of each read with respect to the junction,
N is the normal distribution with mean it 2 —rl/ 2 and SD :7 2 rl/ 4 (rl is
the read length of the reads) and z is a vector made up of njmw ‘sham’
positions that would have minimum distance of —rl/2, that is, the pos-
ition for which reads span both the genes with the maximum number of
bases. The choice of using 2,- enables to constrain GJS) between 0 and 1.
To be clear, we report the following example: let’s assume we have two
cases (i) rl=50, x=—1, —5, —40, —5 and (ii) rl=50, x=(—10, —25,
—30). For both the cases, the vector 2 = (—25, —24, —26). 2 has 3 elements
as the number of unique positions for both the examples we reported
(anmiW = 3), and its elements are the positions with minimum distance
for —rl/2. In case (i) we obtain a GJS = 0.31, whereas in case (ii)
G] S = 0.81.

2.6.2 ES For each junction j, we parted reads in two sets, reads
with relative position X> — rl/2 with respect to the junction (we marked
them by the right subscript) and reads with X 5 —rl/2 (we marked them
by the left subscript). We deﬁned ES with the following formula:


ESJ- = 1 — 1.1 “ , (2)
where the overlines represent the mean, and the 1.1 base is arbitrarily
chosen to soften variations in the exponent. The ES score allows us to
give lower score values to events with the majority of reads that fall in
proximity of the fusion junction or in proximity of irl.

2.6.3 US The US score was conceived to assign higher scores to
events in which the number of spanning and crossing reads are compar-
able. For each junction j, US is defined as the follows:

USj = ,
ma X(" j. crmu‘ a "j. span)

(3)
where njﬂm and njuvpu" are the number of crossing and spanning reads,
respectively.

2.6.4 AdaBoost classiﬁer To better rank predicted gene fusions,
we used an AdaBoost classifier trained with synthetic data (see
‘Results’ section and Supplementary Material). As already reported by
McPherson et al. (2011), AdaBoost was selected because it enables to
improve the predictive power of each individual score and summarize
the aforementioned measures into a single score (we indicate it as
‘EricScore’).

2.7 Filtering the results

Filtering is an essential procedure when dealing with the detection of
chimeric transcripts, as several types of noise of both sequencing and
analysis process can lead to the detection of a large amount of gene
fusion artifacts (Edgren et al., 2011; Sboner et al., 2010). To this end,
we designed a set of heuristic filters with the aim of discarding these false-
positive events.

2.7.1 Duplicate reads We discard all the PE reads that exactly
map to the same position, as they may derive from polymerase chain
reaction or optical artifacts. We use the command rmdup of SAMtools
to remove these events.

2.7.2 Pattern of short reads Scoring the candidate fusions by
means of EricScore allows us to assign to each candidate a probability
score of ‘well’ pattern, and thus classify all the fusions for discriminating
between real transcripts and false-positive events.

2.7.3 Transcript similarity Reads mapping on homologue re-
gions of different genes can lead to chimeric transcript artifacts. To min-
imize these events, we use BLAT to map the 100 bp sequence region

around the wild-type junction against the Ensembl transcriptome.
If BLAT finds that the 100 bp window sequence map 280% of its
length against one of the two candidate fused genes, we remove the can-
didate fusion.

2.7.4 Junction homology The junction coming from fusion pro-
cess can be a homologue with other regions of the transcriptome. To take
into consideration these events, we map the 100 bp sequence region
around the predicted junction against the Ensembl transcriptome with
BLAT. If BLAT finds a homology with other genes, EricScript reports
the percentage of homology, that is, the percentage of the bases of the
homologue gene(s) that overlaps the 100 bp junction sequence.

2.8 Writing results

After the filtering process, EricScript reports the candidate fusions in two
tab-delimited files, one file contains all the predicted fusions, whereas the
other reports the fusions with EricScore >0.5. For each predicted gene
fusion, EricScript outputs several information that include the names of
5’ and 3’ genes and their corresponding biological descriptions, the break-
point positions for both the genes, the sequence that arises from the
fusion process and the type of fusion (inter-chromosomal, intra-
chromosomal, read-through or cis-acting transcripts). Moreover, we
report the four scores (GJS, ES, US, EricScore) and the estimation of
gene expression of wild-type genes and of the gene fusion product by
using a read count approach (see Supplementary Material for more
details).

2.9 Implementation, requirements and availability
EricScript is written in perl, R and bash scripts. It requires the BWA
aligner to perform the mapping of the PE RNA-seq short reads against
the transcriptome, the SAMtools software package (Li et al., 2009) to
handle with the SAM/BAM files created during the analysis and the
BLAT tool to perform the local realignment of the NPMRs against the
exon junction reference. EricScript is freely available under GPL v3 li-
cense at http://ericscript.sourceforge.net.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Synthetic data

To assess a reliable estimation of the performance of EricScript,
we simulated PE RNA—seq data with synthetic gene fusions, and
we compared our method with ChimeraScan (Iyer et al., 2011),
DeFuse (McPherson et al., 2011), FusionMap (Ge et al., 2011)
and ShortFuse (Kinsella et al., 2011). We generated each
synthetic dataset with the following recipe: we randomly ex—
tracted 2 million short reads from the RNA—seq data of un—
treated human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells
generated by Zhang et al. (2012) (SRA accession code:
SRX099065). This dataset is made of 10.3G PE 100 bp reads
sequenced by the Illumina HiScan SQ (Illumina Inc., San
Diego, CA, USA). By aligning all the reads against the
Ensembl transcriptome database version 65 with BWA (version
0.6.2—r126), we estimated that cDNA fragments were generated
from cDNA fragments of length ~164 and SD ~48. The reads
were also trimmed to 50 and 75 bp to evaluate the performance
of each algorithm for different read lengths. The purpose of
introducing these reads in our study is to simulate a background
of ‘synthetic’ gene activity. To simulate synthetic gene fusion
products, we sampled 50 5/—transcripts and 50 3/—transcripts

from the Ensembl transcriptome database version 65. We created
two distinct datasets as follows:

0 Intact exons (IE): Each sampled 5’—transcript was joined
with the corresponding 3’—transcript, and the breakpoints
for both transcripts were randomly chosen among all the
known splicing sites of synthetically fused genes.

0 Broken exons (BE): Each sampled 5’—transcript was joined
with the corresponding 3’—transcript, and the breakpoints
for both transcripts were randomly chosen without exploit—
ing information of the known splicing sites of synthetically
fused genes.

From these novel references, we simulated 50, 75 and 100 bp
PE reads by means of wgsim (http://github.com/lh3/wgsim) (with
—d 164 —r 0.0001 —R 0.001 —s 48). We varied the number of reads
generated by wgsim to simulate different levels of coverage (from
1 to 50). The final synthetic PE RNA—seq dataset is built by
merging, for each read length data, the background dataset
and the simulated gene fusions (for both IE and BE data).
Although such a synthetic dataset is an ideal and simplistic
case for simulating gene fusion processes, the use of it allows
us to objectively assess chimeric transcripts discovery algorithms.
To this end, we generated 50 synthetic PE RNA—seq datasets for
each read length data and for both BE and IE events (for syn—
thetic datasets and 15000 synthetic gene fusions), and we ana—
lysed them by using EricScript (with minreads=2, MAPQ=l
and ntrim: 50), ChimeraScan, DeFuse, FusionMap and
ShortFuse (see Supplementary Material and Supplementary
Table S1 for more details). We compared the performance of
these algorithms by using the following statistical indices:

0 True—positive rate (TPR) or detection sensitivity. We deﬁned
TPR as the number of gene fusions correctly predicted by
the algorithm divided by the number of simulated fusions
(50).

o False—positive rate (FPR) or detection specificity. We deﬁned
FPR as the number of predicted gene fusions that are not in
the list of simulated fusions divided by the number of de—
tected events.

0 False—negative rate (FNR). FNR corresponds to the number
of undetected gene fusions divided by the number of simu—
lated fusions (i.e. 1— detection sensitivity).

0 True—positive sequence rate (TPSR). TPSR is the number of
correctly determined junction sequences divided by the
number of correctly predicted gene fusions.

0 Area under the curve (AUC). AUC is a measure of the ac—
curacy of each algorithm in discriminating between true—
and false—positive results. This parameter is estimated by
means of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve. Details on how ROC curves were built are available
in Supplementary Material.

The TPR, FPR and FNR statistical indices are useful to esti—
mate ‘detection accuracy’ of each algorithm. In fact, these meas—
ures considered all the calls, irrespective of scores assigned to the
identiﬁed fusion events. On the other hand, AUC and the ROC
curves reported in this manuscript enable us to evaluate ‘scoring
accuracy’ of each algorithm, which means the ability of such an

algorithm in discriminating between true— and false—positive
events.

The results of these analyses are reported in Figure 4, Table l
and Supplementary Material. The ROC curves of Figure 4a and
Supplementary Figure S2 clearly show that our algorithm ob—
tains better performance than the other state—of—the—art methods
in distinguishing between true— and false—positive events.
EricScript outperforms the other methods in all the simulations
we performed with different read lengths for both BE and IE
datasets, with the exception of data with read length of 75 and
100 bp in which FusionMap reaches similar results. Figure 4b
shows the capability of the ﬁve algorithms in identifying the
correct fusion genes versus the simulated coverage for all the
IE datasets, whereas Supplementary Figure S2b is related to
BE simulations. For both the datasets, when coverage is <10><,
all the algorithms are not able to reliably discover fused

transcripts. On the other hand, for IE data and for coverage
>10><, our method detects gene fusions with TPR >08 followed
by DeFuse that is able to discover almost 70% of the fusions we
simulated. ChimeraScan and FusionMap detect ~60% of
gene fusion events. For BE data (Supplementary Fig. S2b),
ChimeraScan and ShortFuse lose their prediction capability,
whereas EricScript, DeFuse and FusionMap do not. The
strong performance of EricScript and DeFuse in BE data is be—
cause of the fact that both the algorithms detect fused transcripts
by a split—read approach, allowing them to identify fusions invol—
ving middle of exons. FusionMap performs well on these data—
sets, as we run it with G = 0 to not penalize non—canonical splice
patterns (Supplementary Material). Conversely, ChimeraScan
and ShortFuse are computationally designed to privilege fusions
involving known splicing sites. The results corresponding to dif—
ferent read lengths are reported in Supplementary Figures S37S8.
In these plots, we observe that the overall performance of Defuse
and ShortFuse decreases, whereas the length of the reads in—
creases. This is because of two main reasons (i) these algorithms
have been calibrated on reads of 50 nt in size and (ii) at ﬁxed
coverage, the longer are the reads, the smaller is the number of
discordant reads. Increasing read length does not affect
ChimeraScan, EricScript and FusionMap performance. The re—
sults reported in Table l and Supplementary Table S6 are ob—
tained by averaging across the 150 synthetic IE datasets and 150
synthetic BE datasets, respectively. The FPRs reported in these
Tables highlight that our algorithm outperforms the majority of
the other methods; the probability of EricScript to make a wrong
call is ~015, whereas other algorithms obtain FPR values that
range between 0.15 (ShortFuse) and 0.63 (FusionMap).
However, it is important to note that FPR may be misleading,
as a tool could predict thousands of low scoring false—positive
results. This would affect FPR, even though these events are
easily discernable from true—positive results based on their low
score (see the comments aforementioned on ROC curves ana—
lysis) or on the fact that these events are supported by a few
number of supporting reads. In fact, when we consider calls
with predicted number of supporting reads >5, all the algorithms
(especially FusionMap) show a strong increase in speciﬁcity (see
values in parentheses of Supplementary Tables S77Sl2 and
Supplementary Fig. S9) to the detriment of a small decrease in
terms of sensitivity. The simulation study we performed also

shows that EricScript, DeFuse and FusionMap obtain excellent
results in reconstructing the correct fusion gene junction se—
quences, whereas ChimeraScan and ShortFuse do not output
this information (TPSR score). Table 1 also reports the average
computational time taken by each algorithm to complete the
analysis; ShortFuse obtains the best performance and requires
~80% less time than FusionMap. Although EricScript uses a
four—step alignment pipeline, it takes only 0.53h per CPUs to
perform the analysis. This is because of the fact that we use a
transcriptome instead of a genome reference to map the reads;
this feature does not allow EricScript to detect fusions involving
unannotated transcripts. Supplementary Tables S77Sl2 report
the results relative to different read lengths and make clear the
aforementioned coverage effect. If we set ntrim: 0, EricScript is
also affected by coverage effect mainly for read length of 100 bp
and coverage <10>< (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). This is
the reason why we performed these analyses with ntrim = 50 for
read length of 75 and 100 bp (see Supplementary Material for
more details).

3.2 Application to previously reported gene fusions

We applied EricScript to publicly available PE RNA—seq datasets
(Table 2) with the aim of evaluating its capability in discovering
previously characterized gene fusion products. We analysed the
NCI—H660 prostate cell line dataset for the TMPRSS27ERG and
FOXPliRYBP fusions (Pﬂueger et al., 2011; Sboner et al., 2010)
(see Supplementary Material for a comparison between
EricScript and DeFuse on these data), and we searched for the
23 validated gene fusions in the four breast cancer cell lines of
Edgren et al. (2011) (SRA accession: SRP003186). We run
EricScript on these datasets with two different sets of input par—
ameters, setting a with minreads = 2 and M APQ = l and setting b
with minreads=3 and MAPQ=20 In both cases, EricScript
took ~14 CPU h to complete the whole analysis on ~60 million
reads. The results of the analyses are reported in Table 3.

With parameter setting a, our method predicted 489 fusions
(Supplementary File S1). It was able to detect 22 of the 25 known
fusions, and for all of them, EricScript is able to assemble the
correct sequence of the junction. In the BT—474 library, we pre—
dicted 9/10 validated gene fusion, whereas we missed the fusion
CPNE 17PI3. This fusion was filtered out by EricScript, as BWA
found three discordant alignments with MAPQ=0 between
CPNEl and both P13 and RBM12, potentially indicating a
read—through between CPNEl and RBM12. This situation also
happens for the ANKHDliPCDHl fusion in the SK—BR—3
sample. BWA found six discordant alignments with MAPQ = 0
between ANKHDl and both PCDHl and ANKHDli
EIF4EBP3 (ENSG00000254996). EricScript identiﬁed all the
other validated fusions of SK—BR—3 dataset, including the
DHX357ITCH fusion that, as reported by Kim and Salzberg
(2011), neither DeFuse nor TopHat fusion are able to detect.
In the KPL—4 cell line, we were able to detect all the known
fusions, whereas in the MCF—7 sample, our method was not
able to rediscover the RPS6KB17TMEM49 fusion, as BWA
found no discordant read.

With setting b, EricScript predicted 20 of the 25 validated fu—
sions (see Supplementary File S2) and missed the events sup—
ported by less than three supporting reads (WDR67iZNF704

Table 3 also shows that all the predicted known fusions with
the exception of DHX3}ITCH and TATDN17GSDMB have
an EricScore of >05 (1 1/22 present EricScore 3090). In particu—
lar, the low score of TATDN17GSDMB is because of a low
value of US (US ~029, Supplementary Files S1 and S2); US
was introduced to assign a higher score to candidate fusion genes
in which the number of junction spanning single reads and
paired—end reads connecting the genes are similar. Although
this is a valid assumption for most fusion genes, it may not be

true for fusion genes in which only a short stretch of the 5’ (or 3’)
gene is present. Moreover, this measure is dependent on library
speciﬁc factors, including the length of the cDNA fragments and
lengths of the reads. Generating a speciﬁc dataset that simulates
these features for training our classiﬁer would be useful to im—
prove the classiﬁcation power of EricScore. Despite of that, these
results indicate that EricScore is reliable for discriminating be—
tween true— and false—positive calls also in real data. If we con—
sider only the predicted gene fusions with EricScore >05, we are
able to significantly reduce the number of our set of calls; indeed,
we found 112 fusions for setting a and 84 fusions for setting b.

EricScript to identify chimeric transcripts in RNA-seq data

 

4 CONCLUSION

In this work, we discussed a novel computational approach to
use discordant alignments of paired—end RNA—seq data to iden—
tify chimeric transcripts. Our method, named EricScript, makes
use of the local realignment of the sequence reads that align
across a gene fusion boundary to search for evidence of gene
fusion events. We introduced three novel scores for classifying
the ‘goodness’ of the distribution of the reads that span the junc—
tions. The results we obtained demonstrate that these
approaches, joined with the application of a filtering step, per—
form better than existing methods in distinguishing between real
fusions and false—positive events, resulting in a smaller but robust
set of calls. In fact, the analyses we performed on the synthetic
gene fusion datasets showed that EricScript obtains good results
in terms of both speciﬁcity and sensitivity with low—computa—
tional times. Moreover, our synthetic study demonstrated that
split read—based methods (EricScript and DeFuse) obtain better
performance than the other algorithms, and this is increasingly
true if gene fusions involving middle of exons occur. The large
amount of synthetic gene fusions we generated was also used to
train an AdaBoost classiﬁer that allows us to assign a reliable
probability score to each predicted gene fusion event. The syn—
thetic data generator has been included in the EricScript pack—
age; the synthetic data will represent a good resource for new
developers when testing their methods. We also applied our al—
gorithm to five publicly available datasets, and we tested its cap—
ability in rediscovering previously characterized gene fusions.
Our analyses on both synthetic and real data demonstrated
that EricScript is reliable in assembling the correct sequence of
fusion junctions, allowing for the detection of chimeric events
with a resolution of lbp. The main limitation of our method is
the use of a transcriptome instead of a genome reference for
mapping reads. Although this option allows us to bring down
computational times, it does not enable us to discover gene fu—
sions involving unannotated transcribed regions. Recent reports
(Cabili et al., 2011) suggest that there are an abundance of unan—
notated tissue—speciﬁc genes; in this case methods, such as
DeFuse (McPherson et al., 2011), will be more appropriated to
screen fusions involving these genes.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Ancestral character state reconstruction describes a set
of techniques for estimating phenotypic or genetic features of species
or related individuals that are the predecessors of those present today.
Such reconstructions can reach into the distant past and can provide
insights into the history of a population or a set of species when fossil
data are not available, or they can be used to test evolutionary hypoth-
eses, e.g. on the co-evolution of traits. Typical methods for ancestral
character state reconstruction of continuous characters consider the
phylogeny of the underlying data and estimate the ancestral process
along the branches of the tree. They usually assume a Brownian
motion model of character evolution or extensions thereof, requiring
specific assumptions on the rate of phenotypic evolution.

Results: We suggest using ridge regression to infer rates for each
branch of the tree and the ancestral values at each inner node. We
performed extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of this
method and have shown that the accuracy of its reconstructed
ancestral values is competitive to reconstructions using other state-
of-the-art software. Using a hierarchical clustering of gene mutation
profiles from an ovarian cancer dataset, we demonstrate the use of the
method as a feature selection tool.

1 INTRODUCTION

Many biological studies investigate the ancestral states of one or
several discrete and continuous characters on a phylogenetic tree
(Felsenstein, 2004). Comparative methods correlate the evolution
of alleles at different loci with each other or with a trait and thus
often require the reconstruction of ancestral values. Typical
examples for discrete characters are the reconstruction of the
absence, presence or state of genes or traits for the internal
nodes of the tree (i.e. for the ancestral organisms), while typical
examples for continuous characters are environmental prefer-
ences of different species, measures of morphology or physiology
or behavioral or metabolic properties (Nunn, 2011). Such recon-
structions are also of interest when fossil records cannot be
retrieved, when the phenotype of interest cannot be determined
from the fossil tissue or when studying the evolution of a gene
family across different environmental conditions.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Statistical approaches such as regression or correlation can fail
to estimate correlations between traits correctly when they
assume that closely related species are statistically independent
(Felsenstein, 1985; Grafen, 1989; Harvey and Pagel, 1991).
Comparative methods account for such dependencies by includ-
ing estimates of the phylogeny underlying the data into their
predictions. In the case of continuous characters, most of these
techniques are based on a simple model assuming neutral evolu-
tion of the respective character. The Brownian motion (BM)
model (Felsenstein, 1985) assumes that the trait of a leaf node
in a phylogeny develops as a random walk starting from the
ancestral root. The duration of that walkiand therefore the
change and variance in the traitiis assumed to be proportional
to the change in branch length covered between those two nodes.
At each inner node, the random walk bifurcates, creating two
dependent processes and thus deﬁning a stochastic distribution
for all leaves. Several methods that apply the BM model are
available to reconstruct continuous ancestral characters, and im-
plemented in widely used software packages, such as APE
(Paradis et al., 2004), Geiger (Harmon et al., 2008), Phytools
(Revell, 2012), Mesquite (Maddison and Maddison, 2011),
BayesTrait/Continuous (Pagel, 1999), PAUP* (Swofford, 2003)
and Contml (Felsenstein, 1993).

One of the simplest ways to reconstruct a continuous ancestral
character state was established with Felsenstein’s algorithm for
‘Phylogenetic Independent Contrasts’ (Felsenstein, 1985). In the
Phylogenetic Independent Contrasts algorithm, ancestral values
are computed recursively as the weighted average of their child
values, with the weights set according to the distance (i.e. the
branch length) of these children. In addition, branch lengths
leading to reconstructed internal nodes are rescaled to account
for the uncertainty of the reconstruction. This leads to a
maximum likelihood estimation of the ancestral value for the
root node alone. Other algorithms estimate the values for the
whole tree by re-rooting or by a squared change maximum par-
simony approach (Felsenstein, 2004; Schluter et al., 1997). Linear
regression allows another framework to formulate the recon-
struction of ancestral character states, and generalized least
squares has been suggested as a technique to reconstruct ances-
tral values as a weighted average of the values of all extant spe-
cies, while taking the correlation structure described by the
phylogenetic tree into account (Martins and Hansen, 1997).
This approach is particularly ﬂexible, as it allows detailed
assumptions of the evolutionary process by inclusion of an ap-
propriate covariance matrix. Several possible extensions and
modiﬁcations of the BM process have been suggested and can
be considered for ancestral character state reconstruction. For
example, the OmsteiniUhlenbeck (OU) process models adapta-
tion explicitly by deﬁning a single global optimum (Hansen,
1997) or several local optima (Butler and King, 2004) of

directional selection. A major restriction of the BM and the OU
models, noted in, for example, Harmon et a]. (2010), is the
assumption of a constant rate of trait variation throughout the
underlying phylogeny. The early burst model (Blomberg et al.,
2003; Freckleton and Harvey, 2006) offers an alternative that
decreases the rate of evolution exponentially through time, and
describes a process of adaptive radiation [Harmon et al. (2010)
provide a detailed comparison]. The ACDC model (Blomberg
et al., 2003) describes a process of accelerating versus decelerat-
ing rates of character evolution toward an optimum, i.e. a
combination of OU and early burst. Several methods allow us
to estimate BM rates (Garland, 1992; Lynch, 1990; Martins,
1994), to test for variations in that rate or use different rates in
different parts of the tree (McPeek, 1995; O’Meara et al., 2006;
Revell, 2008) or to suggest global branch length transformations
in the phylogeny to account for variable rates (Blomberg et al.,
2003; Pagel, 1999). However, most of the phylogenetic methods
aforementioned do not explicitly aim to reconstruct ancestral
character states. They are originally concerned with correlations
between two or more traits [‘phylogenetic regression’, Grafen
(1989); Felsenstein (2004)] or with tests for deviation from the
assumption of a globally constant rate, and they do not suggest
how to infer ancestral character states for more complex
scenarios. In addition, critical studies note that deciding on the
correct model might be difﬁcult and warn of over-interpreting
the phylogenetic patterns (Blomberg et al., 2003; Boettiger et al.,
2012; Losos, 2011; Price, 1997).

2 APPROACH

We here describe RidgeRace (Ridge Regression for Ancestral
Character Estimation), a new and simple method inspired by
the least-squares optimization technique of Cavalli-Sforza and
Edwards (1967) for the inference of branch weights in a phyl-
ogeny via pairwise distances. RidgeRace does not assume certain
rates at certain regions of the phylogeny or a particular model of
rate change over time. It treats phenotypic measurements at the
terminal nodes of a phylogeny as sample observations and relies
on a linear regression with L2—Norm regularization, allowing
phenotypic rates to vary at each branch. It estimates branch-
wise rates and ancestral characters simultaneously, in a way
that best describes the phenotypes observed at the terminal nodes.

In an extensive simulation study, we evaluated different
variations of BM on randomly created trees and show that our
method performs equally well as or better than established
implementations of state-of—the-art reconstruction algorithms.
We suggest using RidgeRace in studies aiming to reconstruct
ancestral character states of continuous characters when no def-
inite assumptions can be made about the type of evolutionary
process, or when the assumption of a model for phenotypic
evolution is not appropriate at all. The latter might, for example,
be the case in studies that rely only on a hierarchical clustering of
samples instead of phylogenies.

Branch weights inferred by the ridge regression based on
phenotype measurements can be interpreted as rates of
phenotypic change (i.e. phenotypic rates) and provide insights
into particularly interesting areas of the phylogeny. They can
also be used to judge the phenotypic impact of genetic changes
or other types of events associated with branches within the

phylogeny [see, for example, Steinbriick and McHardy (2012)].
To demonstrate a possible application of RidgeRace integrating
phenotypic and genotypic data, we studied an ovarian cancer
dataset, created by the Cancer Genome Atlas research network
and recently analyzed with network-based stratiﬁcation (Hofree
et al., 2013).

3 METHODS

RidgeRace estimates ancestral character states on a phylogenetic tree.
As in the original BM model, we consider the leaf values to be the
result of a weighted sum of intermediate contributions g,- created along
the tree, beginning at the root (Fig. 1). The contributions represent the
gain or loss in character value on each branch of the tree so that,
for example, the character value of sample y4 can be described as follows:

y4=go + ga +gb + gs,

where a, b and c represent the branches in the tree, and g0 holds a bias
term representing the original contribution of the root node. The
contribution gj of a single branch j can be seen as being analogous to
the formulation of BM: the gain or loss in the phenotype is dependent on
the length I, of branch j and the speed [51- of the process, in analogy to the
variance term 02 in the BM model:

gj:[j‘lgj-

One can then write the solution for the vector of leaf phenotypes y in
matrix form:

9 = L15, (1)
where
I]- if branch j is on the way from the root to samplei
Lid: 1 if j = 0

0 otherwise

state of x1

and ,8 is a vector with a length equal to the number of branches in the
phylogeny, including a single virtual branch above the root to account for
its original contribution go. This scheme is overparameterized, as it adds a
parameter for each inner branch, and only considers one sample
observation for each terminal node. However, it also allows the inclusion
of measurements at inner nodes (e. g. from fossil records), and it is suitable
for accounting for multiple measurements at single leaf nodes. Such
samples can be added by appending rows to y and L.

Ridge regression is a simple extension of ordinary least squares
regression. As ordinary least squares, ridge regression also aims to
minimize the squared error term, but adds a quadratic regularization
penalty on large values of the weight vector ,8. A tuning parameter A
controls the relative impact of both terms. The regularization does not
only help to reduce the variance of the model, it also acts as an integrated
parameter selection method for overparameterized models [see Gareth
et a]. (2013) for details]. We here use ridge regression to estimate a
vector ,8 that explains the known observations y best:

f3= argym X) (y.- — (La-)2 + AZ 15}. (2)
i J'

The textbook solution (Gareth et al., 2013; Hastie et al., 2009) to this
optimization problem is as follows:

[3: (LTL + AI)71LTy. (3)

Equation (2) shows how the optimization balances the leaf reconstruc-
tion error versus the quadratic term that penalizes large variance in the
phenotypic rates. A trivial but undesirable solution to the optimization
would set the gain at each terminal branch equal to the according terminal
node value, leaving all other gains empty and making ancestral recon-
struction impossible.

We here use quadratic regularization instead of L1 regularization. The
latter penalizes the absolute value of the weight vector ,8, driving single
weights toward zero. This would correspond to a phylogeny with many
phenotypic rates at zero and only few branches with rates of high
absolute values, describing a rather implausible model for phenotypic
evolution.

For a given estimate of ,8 as deﬁned in Equation (3), the vector :1
containing the phenotypic reconstruction of all inner nodes can then be
computed in analogy to Equation (1):

a = L’fS, (4)
where
I,- if branch j is on the way from the root to ancestor i
Liv: 1 if j = 0
0 otherwise.

This formulation is similar to the generalized least squares method
proposed by Martins and Hansen (1997). Similarly they suggest inferring
ancestral character states as the weighted average of leaf contributions,
with weights assigned according to the covariance between an ancestor
and a leaf [Equation (10) in Cunningham et a]. (1998); Martins and
Hansen (1997)]:

ﬁ=Wy+e

W = cov[a, y]var[y]’1,

where the covariance between an inner node a and a leaf node y is deﬁned
as 02t(a, y), with t(a, y) being the distance between the root of the tree
and the most recent common ancestor of a and y. RidgeRace differs in
the sense that it allows us to estimate a weight ,8,- for each branch instead
of assuming a constant rate 02 or, more generally, the predeﬁned covari-
ances between nodes. Extensions of the generalized least squares

approach under the BM model use more complex matrices W.
However, the design of W has to be deﬁned in advance based on speciﬁc
model assumptions, whereas RidgeRace is able to estimate rates
independently.

An important assumption of linear regression is that the standard
deviations of the error terms are constant and do not depend on the
covariates (here: the branch lengths). This assumption is violated under
the BM model, as leaf nodes with a long distance to the root will have a
high variance in their trait value and phenotypic measurements will pro-
duce larger errors at these nodes compared with the predicted value. The
estimation of ,8 might thus be biased if the depth of single leaf nodes is
large compared with the rest of the tree. We therefore recommend
RidgeRace for approximately balanced trees.

3.1 Estimation of the regularization weight

The regularization weight parameter A in Equation (2) balances the
impact of accuracy at the leaves versus the complexity of the model
and variance of ,8. To ﬁnd the optimal value of A, we performed a
leave-one-out iteration over all leaves of the tree. To estimate the good-
ness of ﬁt of a particular A0, we iteratively removed a single leaf x from
the tree, estimated ,8 on the remaining tree and used the rate of the branch
leading to the parent of x as an approximation of the branch rate of the
missing node. The leave-one-out error for x is deﬁned as the squared
difference between the inferred phenotypic value for x and the actual
value according to the input data. The leave-one-out error for a particular
A0 is the sum over all leave-one-out errors for all leaves. Iterating
A0 6 {10’6,10’4,...,10+2}, we selected the ﬁnal A to be the one that
minimized the leave-one-out error.

3.2 Simulation study

We created random trees with an increasing number N of leaves using the
function rtree in the R-package APE (Paradis et al., 2004; R Core Team,
2012). We simulated BM with variation 02 along the branches of the tree,
resulting in a character assignment for each inner or leaf node. The
process was repeated several times for different trees and different
values for the parameters 02 and N. Supplementary Text Sl provides
details on the simulation algorithm and the parameter settings. The
random tree and the simulated values obtained at the leaf nodes were
provided as input to RidgeRace and to implementations of the maximum
likelihood and generalized least squares algorithms (Felsenstein, 1985;
Hansen, 1997) in the APE package for ancestral character state estima-
tion (Paradis et al., 2004). The reconstructed values thus obtained were
mapped back to the inner nodes of the tree and compared with the
simulated ones (leaf nodes were excluded from the comparison), and
the mean squared error was computed for evaluation.

3.3 Cancer study

A binary matrix describing the absence or presence of non-synonymous
mutations in 9850 genes for 325 patients was taken from the supplemen-
tary data of an ovarian cancer dataset provided by Hofree et a]. (2013).
Analogous to the description of the authors in their article and
Supplementary Material, we used their network-based stratiﬁcation soft-
ware (NBS, version 0.2, available at http://idekerlab.ucsd.edu) with four
clusters, the HM network and default parameters, creating 1000 boot-
strap samples. We then inferred a hierarchical clustering (average linkage)
on the bootstrap similarity matrix using the methods provided in the
scripts of the authors. We used this inferred topology as the input tree
for RidgeRace. We then downloaded information on each patient’s sur-
vival time from the TCGA database (Cancer Genome Atlas Research
Network, 2011). Treating a patient’s survival time as a ‘trait’ of each
patient, phenotypic rates were inferred with RidgeRace as described
above. The binary genetic proﬁle of each patient was then mapped to

the leaf nodes and reconstructed to inner nodes with the Sankoff
algorithm implemented in RidgeRace, using a simple 0/1 cost matrix
and the ACCTRAN principle in case of ambiguities (Felsenstein,
1985). Changes in the genetic proﬁles of neighboring nodes were then
reconstructed on the branches of the tree. Finally, the tree was visualized
using FigTree (Rambaut, 2013).

4 RESULTS

4.1 Simulation study

Our evaluation of RidgeRace on data consisting of randomly
drawn phylogenetic trees and continuous ancestral characters
states created by a simulated BM process showed that the
method performs similarly or better than other state-of-the-art
techniques. We compared the performance of RidgeRace with
generalized least squares (Hansen, 1997) and REML
(Felsenstein, 1985), and simulated ancestral character evolution
in a BM setting. Figure 2 shows that all three methods were able
to reconstruct ancestral states well, achieving low mean squared
errors, even for small trees or high variation values. The
variation of the mean squared error of all three methods is
large to observe statistically signiﬁcant differences in the meth-
ods; however, on average, RidgeRace performed similar or better
in our simulation than the two alternative methods.

To show another practical application of the RidgeRace
method, we mapped the inferred rates 8 to their associated
branches using an arbitrary random tree from the simulation.
Figure 3 shows such a tree with 25 leaves and BM simulated
in three different regimes that have the internal rate parameters
m of 5.3, 1.3 and 2.3. Simulated phenotypic values are shown as
node labels. The correlation coefﬁcient between the simulated
ancestral states and those inferred by RidgeRace was
r = 0.988. The inferred phenotypic rates vector 8 was plotted
at the branches, and the branches were colored according to
the relative size of these rates, with blue branches indicating
strongly negative weights, red branches indicating strongly posi-
tive weights and gray branches indicating weights close to zero.
Large changes in the phenotype value mainly occurred in Regime
I, which features the largest a parameter. One can observe that

the inferred phenotypic rate is large when the absolute change in
phenotypic value is large compared with the length of the
associated branch. Therefore, plotting the inferred phenotypic
rates to the phylogeny can be useful when studying the evolution
of a population or a set of species. It will visualize regions in the
tree that are associated with rapid phenotypic evolution.

4.2 Application to ovarian cancer data

According to the World Health Organization, cancer is a leading
cause of disease-related deaths worldwide and was responsible
for 7.6 million deaths in the year 2008 (WHO, 2013). The disease
is the result of a complex interplay of genetic preconditions,
external inﬂuences and interactions with the immune system
(Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000, 2011). For a wide variety of
cancer types, recent studies have identiﬁed genes that are signiﬁ-
cantly associated with cancer risk, onset and progression (e.g.
Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2008, 2012a, b,
2013; Kandoth et al., 2013).

Hofree et al. (2013) argue that somatic mutations are likely to
contain the causal driver events of tumor progression, and that
this type of data provides a promising source of information to
identify clinically relevant subclusters. Such subclusters are iden-
tiﬁed with methods that ﬁnd groups of samples with significant
differences in their allele frequency profile, a process described as
stratification. Network-based stratification is a new clustering
method that smooths the sparse and diverse genetic proﬁles
with the help of gene interaction networks (Hofree et al.,
2013), and the authors show that it produces clinically meaning-
ful clusterings. We used a dataset and the software provided by
the authors to reconstruct a hierarchical clustering on somatic
mutation data of ovarian cancer samples. We thus created a tree
structure showing similarities in the genetic proﬁles of the tumors
of ovarian cancer patients (Fig. 4). The tree structure may be
error-prone because of the high diversity of genetic aberrations in
tumors, but their main branches closest to the root are likely to
represent biologically meaningful subclusters (see also argumen-
tation in Hofree et al., 2013).

It was not possible to determine whether our inferred cluster-
ing was completely identical to that of Hofree et al. (2013), as the

exact tree was not provided by the authors. However, we
observed similar cluster sizes and distributions of survival time
in the clusters. We found that patients assigned to the smallest of
the four subtypes showed an increased survival time (Fig. 4,
green cluster). A RidgeRace analysis of patient survival time as
a phenotype consistently showed a strong positive rate increase
in the branch leading to that cluster (Fig. 4, marker m1).
Similarly, RidgeRace inferred a decrease in survival time for
the branch leading to the yellow cluster (branch m2). Branch
m3 was associated with a rather small decrease in survival time
because the red cluster splits in distinct two subtypes with a
successive second increase (branch m5) or a decrease (branch
m4) in survival time, with branch m4 leading to the majority of
the red cluster, which had the lowest survival time of all four
clusters.

RidgeRace reconstruction can be combined with the recon-
struction of discrete genetic events. We mapped the binary
data encoding the absence or presence of non-synonymous mu-
tations in a selection of genes to the tree. The mapping confirmed
the diverse nature of the somatic mutations. Only P53 was found
to be altered in almost all patients and was reconstructed to have
mutated at the root of the tree. Beside P53, only TTN was re-
constructed to change on a higher level node: it was ‘gained’
(mutated) at branch m3 and was present in 83 of 85 patients of

the red cluster. RYRZ was gained on branch m5 and present in 9
of 85 patients in the red cluster. Besides these changes, no change
appeared on a branch higher than ﬁve levels below the root.

4.3 System requirements

RidgeRace requires only minimal system resources (<100 MB
RAM). The C + + implementation relies on the boost ublas library
(BOOST, 2014) to solve the ridge optimization [Equation(3)]. The
running time of a full RidgeRace inference is larger than the time
required by comparable methods (Table 1, measured using an Intel
Xeon X5660 with 2.8 GHz) but still within the range of a few minutes.
The majority of the running time for RidgeRace is consumed by
estimating the A parameter, performing a leave-one-out iteration
over all leaf nodes of the tree and testing
A e {10%, 104', . . . , 10”}. Decreasing the evaluation range for A
or performing the leave-one-out iteration only on a subset of the leaf
nodes can considerably decrease the running time for larger trees.

5 CONCLUSION

We here describe a new method for the inference of ancestral
character states for continuous characters by performing a ridge
regression between the total branch length reaching from the

indicate the subtypes inferred with network-based stratification (Hofree et al., 2013). Branches are colored according to the phenotypic rate parameter 8;
the thickness of branches is proportional to the number of nodes below them. Branches leading directly to leaf nodes were colored gray for improved
visibility. Labels m] to m5 indicate branches with strong changes in patient survival time. Changes in the absence or presence of mutations in the selected

genes are indicated on all branches with four or more children

root to a leaf node and the phenotypic value of that leaf. The
inference is made by minimizing the prediction error at extant
nodes as well as an additional L2-norm regularization factor.
The regularization forces the phenotypic rate to be distributed
more equally across the whole tree and to branches shared by
several nodes, circumventing the trivial case that explains the

phenotype by a gain at the terminal branches owing to the
overparameterization.

Our evaluation showed that RidgeRace achieved a good
congruence between inferred and simulated ancestral charac-
ter states, and that it performed similarly to or better than two
other state-of-the-art methods in terms of the mean squared
error. RidgeRace does not assume any underlying model of
evolution, and thus, the method allows large ﬂexibility when
no deﬁnite assumptions can be made about the type of evo-
lutionary process. The formulation of the optimization problem
[Equation(2)] allows the straightforward inclusion of
measurements at ancestral nodes (e. g. from fossil records). In a
similar fashion, multiple measurements at a node can be easily
included to lend further support to the inference. Such meas-
urements might originate from multiple observations of the
same trait for the same species, or they might represent sev-
eral traits ﬁtted together. Finally, visualization of the
inferred branch weights 8 along the tree allows a detailed inter-
pretation of the speciﬁc phenotypic rates and can indicate
short periods of strong directional selection or of increasingly

RidgeRace: ridge regression for ancestral character estimation

 

fast evolution, or regimes of the phylogeny that feature larger
variation overall.

In our application to the genetic profiles of ovarian cancer
data, we demonstrated that RidgeRace was able to reconstruct
the main clusters of the phenotype distribution. We also
reconstructed changes in the genetic profiles on the branches of
the tree. However, no associations between known genetic aber-
rations and change in survival rate were found for these data.
Nevertheless, this study demonstrated the general functionality
of the method and suggests future extensions. Patient survival
time as a phenotype is a biased measurement, as it is based on the
time of diagnosis and the (potential) death of the patient. It may
also be dependent on many other factors, such as the patient’s
age and the type of therapy received. As RidgeRace can perform
a regression on the patient data, such information could easily be
included as additional covariates (features) in the regression, if
available. This would allow us to control for the inﬂuence of
such factors and provide insights into their relevance relative to
the genetic factors.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The multifactor-dimensionality reduction (MDR) method
has been widely used in multi-locus interaction analysis. It reduces
dimensionality by partitioning the multi-locus genotypes into a high-
risk group and a low-risk group according to whether the genotype-
specific risk ratio exceeds a fixed threshold or not. Alternatively, one
can maximize the x2 value exhaustively over all possible ways of
partitioning the multi-locus genotypes into two groups, and we aim
to show that this is computationally feasible.

Methods: We advocate finding the optimal MDR (OMDR) that would
have resulted from an exhaustive search over all possible ways of
partitioning the multi-locus genotypes into two groups. It is shown
that this optimal MDR can be obtained efficiently using an ordered
combinatorial partitioning (OCP) method, which differs from the
existing MDR method in the use of a data-driven rather than fixed
threshold. The generalized extreme value distribution (GEVD) theory
is applied to find the optimal order of gene combination and assess
statistical significance of interactions.

Results: The computational complexity of OCP strategy is linear in
the number of multi-locus genotypes in contrast with an exponential
order for the naive exhaustive search strategy. Simulation studies
show that OMDR can be more powerful than MDR with substantial
power gain possible when the partitioning of OMDR is different from
that of MDR. The analysis results of a breast cancer dataset show
that the use of GEVD accelerates the determination of interaction
order and reduces the time cost for P-value calculation by more than
10-fold.

1 INTRODUCTION

Analysis of gene—gene interaction is of great concern in modern
genetic studies (Cordell, 2009). With a large number of genes,
Classical statistical methods such as the logistic regression and
Pearson’s X2 test may not be appropriate due to high degree of

freedom involved (Wade, 2000). Methods that can detect multi-locus
interacting genes that may have been overlooked by a single-locus
analysis are of central importance in genetic association studies.

Multifactor-dimensionality reduction (MDR) is a non-parametric
and model-free method that was developed for detecting high-
order gene—gene interaction in the absence of marginal effects
(Ritchie et al., 2001, 2003). Operationally, the MDR method
divides the multi-loci genotype combinations into high- and low-
risk groups according to whether the ratio of cases to controls
exceeds a ﬁxed threshold or not. As noted by Moore et al.
(2006), this is a constructive induction method that Changes the
representation space of the data by reducing/recoding the single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) combinations to a single binary
attribute. This results in a 2 X 2 contingency table and the sparsity
and the high-dimensionality problems are greatly alleviated. The
Pearson’s X2 statistic is calculated but with P-value determined
using a permutation procedure rather than from a X2 distribution with
one degree of freedom (df). Empirical studies show that the MDR
method is a useful tool for testing high-order gene—gene interaction
(Moore et (11., 2006; Ritchie et al., 2001). Since it was proposed, the
MDR method has been widely applied to multi-locus association
studies (Cho et al., 2004; Julia et al., 2007; Ritchie et al., 2001; Tsai
et al., 2007).

Many efforts have been made to improve the power of MDR, such
as the extended MDR (EMDR) of Mei et al. (2005), modiﬁed MDR
methods based on balanced accuracy (Velez et al., 2007), likelihood
ratio and normalized mutual information (Bush et al., 2008) or other
evaluation measures (Namkung et al., 2009). Some other extensions
of MDR such as the odds ratio-based MDR (OR-MDR; Chung
et al., 2007), model-based MDR (MB-MDR; Calle et al., 2008),
log-linear model-based MDR (LM-MDR; Lee et al., 2007) and
generalized MDR (GMDR; Lou et al., 2007) were also developed.
These extensions make the MDR more ﬂexible in applications
(Moore et al., 2010).

In recent years, many other data mining algorithms for detecting
high-order genetic interactions such as Classiﬁcation trees, random
forests and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) have
been proposed (Montana, 2006). Chatterjee et al. (2006) developed a
powerful multi-locus parametric test based on Tukey’s 1-df model of
interaction. Millstein et al. (2006) proposed the focused interaction
testing framework (FITF). The performance of neural networks
evolved from genetic programming is studied by Bush et al. (2005).
Motsinger-Reif et al. (2008) compared the performances of six
methods for testing main effects and interactions. The six methods

they considered are MDR, grammatical evolution neural networks,
random forests, FITF, step-wise and explicit logistic regression.
Heidema et al. (2007) compared MDR with set association (Hoh
and Ott, 2003), and random forests and suggested the use of a
combination of existing multi-locus methods in genetic association
studies. Bastone et al. (2004) demonstrated that MDR is a special
case of recursive partitioning (Breiman et al., 1984). Park and
Hastie (2008) illustrated penalized logistic regression based on L2
regularization used in interaction detection. The FlexTree algorithm
(Huang et al., 2004) is also introduced along with their method.
Chen et al. (2008) proposed to use a support vector machine
and a combinatorial optimization method in gene—gene interaction
detection.

The MDR is originally designed for balanced case—control
studies. It partitions the contingency table by collapsing multi-locus
genotypes with risk ratios equal to or greater than the threshold 1 as
high risk and others as low risk (for unbalanced case—control studies,
the threshold is the ratio of the numbers of cases to controls). Such a
partitioning strategy using a ﬁxed threshold may not be optimal since
it excludes many other possible ways of partitioning. Intuitively, a
different threshold that yields a larger value of the X2 statistic could
possibly lead to a more powerﬁil test. In this article, we show that
the optimal threshold for maximizing the X2 value can be obtained
by using an ordered combinatorial partitioning (OCP) algorithm.
Although our OCP algorithm maximizes over the ordered partitions
only, which is what makes it computationally feasible, we prove that
the algorithm has not missed anything important and will still give us
the global maximal X2 that would have resulted from an exhaustive
search over all possible partitions. We call the optimal partitioning
produced by the OCP algorithm as the optimal MDR (OMDR).
To reduce the computational burden of permutation in assessing
signiﬁcance and determining the order of interaction, we propose
a procedure based on the generalized extreme value distribution
(GEVD) approximation in the OMDR method.

This article is organized as follows. In Section 2.1, the limitations
of the partitioning strategy used in the original MDR are illustrated
by a simple example. The OCP strategy is then proposed for
partitioning a contingency table. The computational complexity of
the OCP and the resulting OMDR are discussed. In Section 2.2, we
introduce the GEVD approximation method for interaction order
determination and signiﬁcance assessment in the OMDR method.
Simulation studies for comparing the MDR and the OMDR are
conducted in Section 3. Finally, some discussions about the OMDR
and the OCP method are given in Section 4.

2 METHODS

In Sections 2.1 and 2.2. we introduce the two key ingredients of the OMDR
method. namely. the efﬁcient exhaustive partitioning method. OCP. and the
GEVD method in interaction order determination and the computation of a
validity measure.

2.1 OCP method

MDR partitions multi-locus genotype combinations according to their risk
levels based on a ﬁxed threshold. Here. we review this strategy in detail
and point out its limitations. Suppose that n dichotomous genes such as
SNP markers (each gene has three genotypes) are considered for testing
interactions. The 3” genotype combinations of cases and controls can be
summarized in a 2 X 3” contingency table. One can calculate the ratio of

the number of cases to the number of controls for each of all 3” genotype
combinations. We further assume that the columns of the contingency table
that contain no observations have been deleted. and the columns are sorted
into an ascending order according to the ratios. Based on the ordered
contingency table. the MDR method labels each genotype combination as
‘high risk” if its ratio meets or exceeds some chosen threshold (e. g. the ﬁxed
threshold 1 used in the original MDR in balanced casewontrol studies).
or ‘low risk” otherwise. Fixing the threshold beforehand is an attractive
feature of the MDR method since this can reduce the computational expense
substantially. However. even in some simple situations. partitioning based
on a ﬁxed threshold as is the case in the MDR method may lead to substantial
loss of power compared with an exhaustive search strategy. We illustrate this
using an artiﬁcial 2 X 3 casewontrol data as shown in Table 1.

For this dataset. the P-value of the standard 2-df Pearson”s X2 statistic is
0.019. which reports an insigniﬁcant result at the 0.01 level (all P-values
are obtained from permutation with 105 replicates). Since the ﬁrst two
columns have ratios less than 1. while the third column has ratio greater
than 1. we combine the ﬁrst two columns together to get Table 2 (left) and
the standard 1-df Pearson”s X2 statistic for this table is 240 ><(10 X 100—
20><110)2/(120 ><120>< 30>< 210)=3.810. and the P-value based on 105
replicates of Monte Carlo simulation increases to 0.088. which concludes
an insigniﬁcant result even at the 0.05 level. However. if we use a different
threshold. say. 0.8. and classify the last two columns as ‘high risk” and
collapse them into one column. then we have another 2 X 2 table (Table 2.
right) with X2 statistic 240 X (1 X 110— 10 X119)2/(120 X 120 ><11>< 229):
7.717 (double the statistic of MDR. 3.810). which is the maximal 1-df X2
statistic of all 2 X 2 collapsed tables. and the P-value reduces to 0.006. which
concludes a signiﬁcance result at the 0.01 level.

The simple example shown above suggests that a partitioning strategy
with a different threshold may improve the result of MDR substantially.
In this article. we propose an exhaustive search method based on the OCP
property (Theorem 1 below). which can quickly identify the threshold that
corresponds to the 2 X 2 table with the maximal X2 value among all possible
2 X2 tables. The computational cost of this method is much smaller than
the naive exhaustive search method. Before presenting our main results. we
introduce a couple of concepts.

DEFINITION 1 (CP). Let S be a 2 X K contingency table. An integer set ’P:
{i1,i2, --- ,i,,} C {1,2, --- ,K} is calleda combinatorialpartition (CP) ofS ifthe
columns in ’P and columns in ’P’ s compliment ’Pc are, respectively, collapsed
into one column, to form a new 2 X 2 table.

DEFINITION 2 (OCP). Let S be a 2 X K contingency table with each column
having at least one positive entry, and suppose that S is sorted into ascending

order by column according to the risk ratio of each column. Then the CPs
’P={1,2,--- ,i},1 SiSK— 1, are called OCPs.

Obviously. fora 2 X K contingency table S . there are up to 2K” — 1 distinct
CPs. while the number of distinct OCPs is not more than K — 1. Without
loss of generality. for n candidate genes. suppose that each gene (e.g. SNP)
has three genotypes. which are labeled as 0,1 and 2. Then the genotype
combinations can be organized as a 2 X 3” contingency table. with the ﬁrst
row containing the counts of the genotype combinations of the cases and
the second row for the controls. The naive exhaustive strategy that ﬁnds
the optimal table with maximal X2 value would involve up to 23nT1—1
collapsed tables and calculations of X2 statistics. This number is enormously
large even when n is small. For example. three genes corresponds to up
to 233—1—1267108863 tables. Therefore. it is not feasible to use such
exhaustive strategy. The following theorem states that the exhaustive search
can be accomplished efﬁciently by an OCP method.

THEOREM 1 (OCP optimality). For any contingency table S, let 9 be the set
of all CPs, and 52,, be the set of all OCPs of S. Then

An equivalent result has been established previously by Shih (2001).
which is a corollary of a general theorem given in Breiman et al. (1984).
During the preparation of this article. we found this result independently and
an elementary proof can be found in Supplementary Material. We shall call
any 730 E 90 maximizing the X2 value as the optimal OCP. According to the
deﬁnition. any CP selected by MDR is also an OCP. but it is not necessarily
the optimal OCP. The example in Section 2.1 sheds some lights on this.

Table 3 illustrates the upper bounds of computational complexities
(number of X2 computed) for naive exhaustive search. OCP (for OMDR).
and CP with ﬁxed threshold (for MDR) strategies. Compared with the naive
exhaustive search strategy. the OCP strategy is much more efﬁcient. In real
data analysis. the computational burden can be further reduced by using
the sparsity property. Suppose the total sample size is k. then the number
of columns with at least one positive count would be at most k. and the
computation complexity is not more than k — 1.

The analysis above suggests that the computational complexity of OCP
procedure should be bounded by the minimum of the number of OCPs and
the total sample size. In fact. this upper bound can be further relaxed. Suppose
S1 is a contingency table with positive margins and it is sorted into ascending
order by column according to the ratio of the number of cases to controls.
Since the columns with zero entries for cases have ratio 0. these columns
can be combined into one column; likewise. the columns with zero entries
for controls can be combined into another column. Let S; be this combined
version of S1. We have the following proposition. the proof of which can be
found in Supplementary Material.

PROPOSITION 1. Suppose S1 is a contingency table and S2 is the combined
version ofSl. Then

We illustrate the above property by an example. We generated the
genotypes of 50 cases and 50 controls based on Model 6 in Ritchie et al.
(2003). In this example. we can ﬁnd the optimal OCP of the 2 X 729 table
with only about 11 operations according to Proposition 1. which is much
smaller than the number of OCPs 728 and the total sample size 100.

2.2 Order determination and P-value calculation by
GEVD

Adequacy of the MDR method was assessed by comparing the average cross-
validation (CV) consistency (or prediction error) from the observed data to
the distribution of average consistency (or prediction error) under the null
hypothesis of no associations derived empirically from 10-fold CV and a
large number of permutations. Thus. the computational burden is huge when
the number of loci is large. In this article. in order to reduce computational
burden we will use a P-value approximated by a GEVD (Jenkinson. 1955)
as a validity measure for the OMDR procedure. A similar approach has been
used in Pattin et al. (2008). We describe the procedure as follows.

Suppose we want to detect interactions up to order N0. N0 <N. For every
order n (n: 1,2, - -- ,No) and every choice of n+1 loci out of the total of N.
we use the OCP method to ﬁnd the maximal 1-df X2 statistic. The optimal
gene combination for this order of interaction is the one which maximizes
the maximal X2 statistic and we denote this maximum by T20). The P-value
of T20) is used to measure signiﬁcance of the n-order interaction model. The
optimal order of interaction is the one with the smallest P-value. Since T20)
is the maximum of many X2 statistics. we assume that its null distribution
can be approximated by a GEVD with cumulative distribution function

 

X_M —1/s
F(x:u.m§)=exp —[1+E< a  .E(x—u)>—U. (1)

where —00 < mg < +oo,o> 0. Therefore. the P-value of Trio) can be
approximated by p” = 1 —F(T,(,0); u, o, E).

To compute p”. we randomly permute the casewontrol labels of the
original dataset to get M sets of null data. Since we have assumed the
distributional form of the null distribution. the number of permutation
replicates. M . can be taken to be very small (say. less than 50 for
most studies). The maximal 1-df X2 for these M permutation datasets.
{T,(,m),n=1,2,---,m=1,2,---,M}. can be obtained in the same way as that
for T20). Then. we use the permutation sample {T,(,m) , m = 1, ...,M} to estimate
the unknown parameters in p” based on the maximum likelihood principle.
With this permutation sample. we can get the maximum likelihood estimates
(MLEs) of the three parameters mg and a. Notice that the asymptotic
property of the MLE may not hold if the shape parameter E falls outside the
interval [—0.5,0.5]. Actually. the MLE may not exist if |§| Z 1 (Smith. 1985).
Therefore. we solve for the MLE with a constraint —0.5 5 E 5 0.5. The initial
values of parameters are generated by the probability-weighted moment
method (Hosking et al.. 1985). For each n: 1,2, - -- ,No. the P-value. p”. for
testing association between any n genes and disease can then be estimated
by Z)” = 1 —F(logT,(,0) ; Wang”). where ﬁnﬁmén are estimated parameters.
The order of interaction is estimated by n =argmin{p1 , 732, - -- , [)NO}. and the
corresponding gene combination is chosen as the ﬁnal interaction model.

Finally. we need to assess the signiﬁcance of the detected model by
computing the P-value of  To do this efﬁciently. we apply the GEVD
theory again and assume — log has a GEVD distribution as in (1) under the
null hypothesis. To estimate the parameters in this distribution. we permute
the original dataset again and repeat the above procedure M1 times and get
null values —log[);;:),m= 1,2,...,M1. These values are used to estimate the
parameters in the GEVD distribution and hence the P-value of  Note
that due to application of the GEVD theory. the total number. MM 1. of
permutations is relatively small. Figure 1 illustrates the procedure of the
OMDR method.

3 RESULTS

In this section, we ﬁrst show some simulation results, then we apply
our method to a real dataset.

3.1 Simulation

We conducted simulations to compare the proposed OMDR with
MDR. We considered 10 diallelic genetic markers (e.g. SNPs),
two of which were assumed to be associated with the disease and
the others are not associated. We generated genotypes of the two
associated markers from four different two-locus models. Under
Model 1 (Table 4), the two markers have no marginal effects but
have interaction effects (Culverhouse et al., 2002). Models 2, 3
and 4 (Table 5) are the epistasis model, the threshold interaction

model, and the multiplicative interaction model considered in
Marchini et al. (2005) and Pickrell et al. (2007). In generating
genotype data for the 10 genes, we assume they obey the Hardy—
Weinberg equilibrium law and are in linkage equilibrium in the
population. The population minor allele frequencies are 0.25 for
the associated loci and 0.5 for the other 8 loci. In what follows,
we consider interactions up to the order of N0=4 and all of the
simulation results are based on 400 replications. In addition, we
consider balanced case—control study only, i.e. the numbers of cases
and controls are equal since the results for unbalanced design are
similar. As mentioned in the introduction, there are many versions
and extensions of MDR in the literature. We use the version based
on consistency and predictive error as the benchmark (Ritchie et al.,
2003) in our comparisons.

Table 6 shows the empirical Type I error rates of the OMDR
method based on 400 replicates of simulation and M =M1 =
50 permutation replicates in order determination and P-value
calculation. We can see that all the empirical Type I error rates of
OMDR are close to the nominal level 0.05. Our simulations suggest
that the number of permutation replicates can even be reduced to
20 without inﬂating the size of test when the total sample size is
between 200 and 600. Simulation results for other choices of minor
allele frequencies also show that the GEVD method can well control
the Type I error rate of the OMDR method (results are not shown
here).

In our simulation study, we deﬁne the detection rate (DR) as the
probability of successﬁilly pinpointing the true set of interacting
genes by the OCP method when the order of interaction is known
a priori. The detected set is the one with maximal X2 no matter
it is signiﬁcant or not. Power is deﬁned as the success probability
of locating the pre-disposing genes without knowing the order of
interaction while controlling the Type I error. Since determining
order of interaction may have extra error, power is always less than
the DR.

Figure 2 shows DRs and powers for Model 1. It is seen that,
compared with the MDR, OMDR has a substantial gain in DR and

power. For example, when the tuning parameter (1) is 7 in Model
1 (Fig. 2A) the DR gains of OMDR over MDR are 0.20, 0.73 and
0.71, and the power gains are 0.05, 0.28 and 0.79 for sample sizes
400, 800 and 1200, respectively. In addition, when the total sample
size is ﬁxed to be 1200 and the size of interaction effect (1) changes
from 4 to 7 (Fig. 2B), the DR increment of OMDR ranges from 0.11
to 0.71, while the power gain ranges from 0.01 to 0.79.

We also studied the situation that the associated loci have both
main and interaction effects. Table 5 lists three models of this kind
that were studied in the literature, namely, the epistasis, threshold and
multiplicative interaction models. Simulation results for the former
two models are summarized in Figure 3. The sizes of the main
effects of the two associated loci are ﬁxed to be A :21 :2; :20.
Again, the DR of OMDR is uniformly higher than that of MDR.
For the threshold interaction model, the DR gain of OMDR over
MDR ranges from 0.22 to 0.39. Except for the case of y=2.5 and
sample size 400, the power gain of OMDR over MDR is around 0.3
for all the other ﬁve cases depicted in the lower panels of Figure 3.
Figures 2 and 3 show that the power of the OMDR method can be
even greater than the DR of MDR when the interaction effect is
large. Analogous results but with smaller power gain are observed
for the epistasis model. For example, when the total sample size is
1200, the power gains of OMDR are 0.04 and 0.07 for interaction
effect y=3,4. But when interaction effect is smaller (y=2), no
power gain is spotted. For the multiplicative interaction model and
the six models used in Ritchie et al. (2003), the DR behavior of
OMDR and MDR are similar but OMDR is slightly less powerﬁil
(see Supplementary Material), with the biggest power difference of
0.12 recorded for Model 5 (0.70 for MDR and 0.58 for OMDR).
The magnitude of this loss in power by OMDR is not as big as the
power gained by OMDR for the interaction model with no marginal
effect (Fig. 2) and the threshold interaction model (Figure 3C and D),
which can reach 0.79 and 0.31, respectively.

Upon closer scrutiny, we ﬁnd out what happened was that OMDR
would sometimes select a larger model containing the true model
instead of the true model. MDR did not suffer from this problem
because it selects order of interaction by means of an integer
valued criterion called consistency and it gives preferences to lower
order models in case of ties. In contrast, OMDR selects order by
minimizing the estimated P-values that are continuous with no

ties in general, and sometimes a higher than necessary order of
interaction is chosen because its P-value is just slightly smaller.
Since MDR favors small models by design and the true model used
to simulate the data is of order 1 only, the fact that MDR is slightly
more powerful than OMDR for the six models of Ritchie is perhaps
understandable.

3.2 Real data analysis

We applied the GEVD-based OCP and the permutation distribution
based OCP to ﬁnd the OMDR for the real case—control dataset
from the Ontario Familial Breast Cancer Registry (John et al.,
2004). This case-control study contains 398 breast cancer cases
and 372 population controls. Onay et al. (2006) analyzed the
data set as summarized below. Nineteen SNPs from 18 cancer-
related genes passed the Hardy—Weinberg equilibrium test. Under
recessive, dominant and co-dominant models, an unconditional
logistic regression procedure was employed for each SNP by
adjusting for age, BMI and family history. Only XPD-[Lys751Gln]
showed a signiﬁcant main effect at the 0.05 level according to a
crude P-value. However, none of the 19 SNPs showed signiﬁcant
evidence of a main effect after correcting for multiple testing by
applying the false discovery rate (FDR) principle (Benjamini and
Hochberg, 1995). On the other hand, four two-way interactions,
XPD-[Lys751Gln] and IL10-[G(-1082)A], GSTP1-[Ile105Val] and
COMT—[Met108/158Val], COMT—[Met108/158Val] and CCND1-
[Pro241Pro], and BARDl-[Pro24Ser] and XPD-[Lys751Gln], were
detected at the 0.05 level based on FDR-adjusted P-values under
a co-dominant model, although none of these four two-way
interactions remained signiﬁcant by Bonferroni adjustment. The
joint genotype counts of the four SNP pairs are given in Table 5
in Onay et al. (2006).

We used M =M1 = 100 permutation replicates to get more stable
and accurate estimations of P-values. Results of two-way interaction
analysis are shown in Table 7. Note that the P-values computed
by GEVD are quite similar to those computed by 105 permutation
replicates. Meanwhile, the computation time is reduced more
than 10-fold by using the GEVD method in our setting. Thus,
using GEVD rather than permutation with the OCP method can
signiﬁcantly reduce the computation time while ensuring accuracy.

The OCP solution, being the maximal X2, is always not less than the
MDR solution and, in this example, they coincide with each other.
Therefore, in Table 7 the P-values of OCP method using GEVD
approximation or permutations are also similar to but slightly larger
than the ones from the MDR method. We also provided some real
data examples in the Supplementary Material to show that it is a

common phenomenon in practice that the partitionings of MDR and
OMDR are different in which case the maximal X2 statistic will be
strictly larger than the MDR solution.

False positive report probabilities (FPRPs) listed in Table 7 are
from Table 4 in Onay et al. (2006), only the analysis results adjusted
for age are presented due to the highly missing proportion of BMI.
FPRP is deﬁned as the probability that the null hypothesis is true
given a statistically signiﬁcant result due to some test procedure,
which depends on the prior probability that the null hypothesis is
true, the level and statistical power of the test (Thomas and Clayton,
2004; Wacholder et al., 2004). According to FPRP at the 0.1 level,
at least two out of the four interactions are unnoteworthy: COMT-
[Met108/158Val] and CCND1-[Pro241Pro], BARDl-[Pro24Ser]
and XPD-[Lys75 lGln] were reported to be insigniﬁcant. Our OMDR
method also reports insigniﬁcance of these two interactions at the
0.05 level (P-value=0.066 and 0.087, respectively), while agrees
with the conclusion in Onay et al. (2006) that the interaction of
XPD-[Lys751Gln] and IL10-[G(-1082)A] plays a very important
role in breast cancer (P=0.005). However, OMDR suggests that
the interaction of GSTPl-[Ile105Val] and COMT-[Met108/158Val]

might not be signiﬁcant (P=0.137), which is different from the
conclusion in Onay et al. (2006) based on FDR-adjusted P-value
and FPRP.

4 DISCUSSION

MDR is a powerful non-parametric method in genetic interaction
studies. Many empirical computer studies and real data analyses
have demonstrated the impressive capability of MDR in detecting
high-order interactions. The key idea of MDR is the pooling of
high-dimensional predictors into two distinct groups, which reduces
dimensionality and alleviates the sparsity problem. We observe that
the power can be further improved by introducing the exhaustive
search strategy. In this study, an OCP-based search strategy is
proposed for ﬁnding the optimal contingency table with largest X2
statistic, which has computational complexity that is dramatically
lower than that of the exhaustive search method. The GEVD theory
is employed to ﬁirther reduce computational cost. Both simulation
studies and real data analysis show that the GEVD approximation is
rather accurate and much more computationally efﬁcient than using
the permutation distribution.

Simulation studies in Ritchie et al. (2003) show that the MDR
method performs robustly in the presence of noise due to genotype
error and missing data, but may lose power substantially in the
presence of phenocopy. Chen et al. (2008) proposed a gene—gene
interaction detection approach based on the support vector machine
and demonstrate several advantages of their machine learning
method by simulation studies, especially the strong ability (e.g.
power and model stability) to handle sample noise. Since the OMDR
method always leads to higher DRs than MDR, it is conceivable that
our OMDR method can deal properly with this noise while MDR
does not. The performance of OMDR in the presence of these sources
of noise will be explored in ﬁiture studies and compared with Chen
et al.”s (2008) method.

Another important issue is the class-imbalance problem in gene—
gene interaction detection. The generalization ability of many
classiﬁcation methods such as logistic regression will be weakened
by extremely imbalanced datasets. In balanced case—control design,
the threshold used by MDR is l which can be naturally adjusted
by the ratio of cases to controls when the design is unbalanced.
Velez et al. (2007) proposes the balanced accuracy ﬁinction deﬁned
as the arithmetic mean of sensitivity and speciﬁcity to substitute
the accuracy ﬁinction such as cross-validation consistency and
prediction error used in previous literature (Ritchie et al., 2001,
2003). Simulation shows that the power of the MDR method
using this balanced accuracy function with the adjusted threshold
can be elevated efﬁciently. Since the variable threshold used in
OMDR is data-driven, our OMDR method can also be applied
without modiﬁcation to detect gene—gene interactions in unbalanced
case—control studies.

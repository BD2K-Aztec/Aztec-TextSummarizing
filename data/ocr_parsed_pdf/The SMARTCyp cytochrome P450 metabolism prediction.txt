1 INTRODUCTION

The most important drug-metabolizing enzymes in humans are
cytochromes P450 (CYPs). They oxidize a wide range of substrates
and contribute to the metabolism of 90% of all drugs (Lewis, 2008).

While there are methods for site of metabolism prediction which
are solely based on semi-empirical calculations of the substrates
(Hennemann et (11., 2009; Zheng et (11., 2009), more accurate results
should be achieved by explicitly including the reactivity of each
site in a substrate. Hitherto, reactivity models for CYPs have
been restricted to semi-empirical calculations of the stability of
intermediates (Jones et (11., 2002). Later studies have shown that
more accurate activation energies for CYPs can be computed by
performing very time consuming density functional theory (DFT)
transition state calculations on a heme group porphyrin ring model
(Olsen et (11., 2006; Rydberg et (11., 2008a, b; Shaik et (11., 2005).
SMARTCyp, however, presents the ﬁrst solution for both fast and
exact prediction of CYP reactivity. Accuracy of activation energies
is ensured by making very extensive DFT calculations and speed is
gained by saving these in a precalculated library so that they need
only be looked up at execution. SMARTCyp has been validated for
prediction of metabolism by the 3A4 isoform, which contributes to
the metabolism of half of all drugs (Guengerich, 1999). SMARTCyp
has also been shown to work well for six other CYP isoforms
(Rydberg et (11., 2010a, b). In this application note, we describe
the SMARTCyp server, the ﬁrst web service for prediction of
CYP-mediated metabolism.

2 NEW FUNCTIONALITY AND IMPROVEMENTS
TO SMARTCYP

The detailed description of the SMARTCyp algorithm,
development and DFT calculations has been published elsewhere

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

(Rydberg et (11., 2010c). In this section, we highlight signiﬁcant
improvements as well as new features and functions in the current
version 1.5.

2.1 Increased accuracy

For this version, 72 new DFT calculations were performed and added
to the 139 previous to reﬁne and create additional SMARTS rules.
The library of SMARTS rules is used to look up atom activation
energies in molecules by SMARTS patterns. The majority of the new
calculations were performed to systematically evaluate and reﬁne the
rules for nitrogen dealkylations of peptide and acetamide groups, as
well as oxidation of aromatic ﬁve-membered rings and heterocycles.
The new rules have resulted in signiﬁcant improvements to the
prediction of the activation energies of these fragments. Rules
and calculations are presented in Table 1 (overall distribution) and
Supplementary Material (DFT results and SMARTS deﬁnitions).

We have analyzed the accuracy of SMARTCyp on a set of
361 drug-like CYP3A4 substrates (Table 2). The substrates were
taken from the dataset in our previous work (Rydberg et (11.,
2010c), by extracting all molecules deﬁned as drug-like according
to the ‘lip_druglike’ descriptor in the MOE software (Chemical
Computing Group Inc., version 2007.09). The results show an
improved accuracy of 2 percentages compared with the original
SMARTCyp implementation.

A preliminary validation against data for other CYP isoforms
shows that a similar performance can be expected for the isoforms
1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C19 and 2E1 (Rydberg et (11., 2010a, b).

173 86 (84)% 81 (79)%

 

Amolecule is considered correctly predicted if an experimentally determined metabolic
site is found among the one, two or three top ranked atoms, respectively.

Fig. 1. SMARTCyp results for testosterone. All ﬁve metabolic sites of
testosterone are predicted correctly as top ranking atoms and the major
metabolite is ranked as number one (Yamazaki et al., 1997).

2.2 Improved detection of symmetric atoms

CDK (Steinbeck et (11., 2003, 2006) offers several ways for
topological symmetry detection. SMARTCyp 1.0 implemented a
combination of Morgan numbers (Morgan, 1965) and SMARTS
rules, whereas the current version uses the algorithm by Hu and Xu
(1994). The change of method has increased accuracy signiﬁcantly.

2.3 Java program output options

The command-line SMARTCyp Java program now has three
optional ﬂags, which enable the user to suppress HTML or
csv output, as well as direct the output to a speciﬁc directory.
Suppressing HTML and generating only csv output makes the
program even faster and allows for integration with other softwares.

3 SMARTCYP WEB SERVER

3.1 Interface features

The SMARTCyp server offers the user three ways to submit
molecules. The user can upload a ﬁle in any stande format, enter
SMILES strings representing molecules or draw a molecule.

The results are displayed directly in the browser and include the
molecular structure and an atom ranking table for each molecule as
shown in Figure 1. The three top-ranked atoms are highlighted both
in the structure and the table. Furthermore, all atom numbers can be
displayed by hovering the mouse pointer over the structure.

3.2 Implementation

The SMARTCyp web server uses php code to run SMARTCyp
and the interface functionality. To support all standard formats,

uploaded ﬁles are converted by Open Babel (Guha et (11., 2006)
when necessary. SMARTCyp is implemented using the CDK Java
library (Steinbeck et (11., 2003, 2006).

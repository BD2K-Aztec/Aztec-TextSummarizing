Abstract

Motivation: Wide application of modeling ofthree—dimensional protein structures in biomedical re—
search motivates developing protein sequence alignment computer tools featuring high alignment
accuracy and sensitivity to remotely homologous proteins. In this paper, we aim at improving the
quality of alignments between sequence profiles, encoded multiple sequence alignments.
Modeling profile contexts, fixed—length profile fragments, is engaged to achieve this goal.

Results: We develop a hierarchical Dirichlet process mixture model to describe the distribution of
profile contexts, which is able to capture dependencies between amino acids in each context pos—
ition. The model represents an attempt at modeling profile fragments at several hierarchical levels,
within the profile and among profiles. Even modeling unit—length contexts leads to greater im—
provements than processing 13—length contexts previously. We develop a new profile comparison
method, called COMER, integrating the model. A benchmark with three other profile—to—profile
comparison methods shows an increase in both sensitivity and alignment quality.

1 Introduction

Proteins, large molecules, perform a huge number of functions
within living organisms. Given that the three-dimensional (3D)
structure of a protein determines its function, Structural Genomics
centers aim and dominant programs such as the Protein Structure
Initiative (Montelione, 2012) aimed at the determination of the 3D
structure for most proteins in nature to facilitate understanding of
how living organisms function. With increasing coverage of protein
fold space (Khafizov et (11., 2014), these efforts are greatly assisted
by building protein models by homology to solved 3D structures
(Schwede, 2013). Homology discovery founded on data of solved
3D structures, therefore, constitutes the foundation for homology
modeling. Results of the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction
(CASP) experiments (Moult et (11., 2014) reveal homology search
methods as some of the most decisive intermediate means in protein
3D structure prediction. Based on alignments of sequence profiles
(generalizations of protein sequence families), these methods

(Séding and Remmert, 2011) can reliably establish homologous rela-
tionships even between proteins sharing nearly random (6—8%) se-
quence identity. Nevertheless, such relations are remotely
homologous and are often missed. Increasing the sensitivity to re-
motely homologous proteins and the accuracy of alignments is ac-
cordingly of great practical importance.

To improve the quality of the sequence profile and to obtain the
probability distribution of amino acids (residues) more relevant to
the sequence family, many efforts were put into the calculation of
mutation (substitution) probabilities, including the development of
the pseudo-counts (Altschul et (11., 2009; Sjolander et (11., 1996),
composition-based statistics (Schéiffer et (11., 2001) and compos-
itional adjustment (Yu and Altschul, 2005) and mixing with many
other sequence/structure-derived measures (see, e.g. Yan et (11.,
2013). The advances in the calculation of substitution probabilities
at each profile position have induced more accurate profile align-
ments and consequently, increased sensitivity to remote homologs

(Kryshtafovych et al., 2014). Despite the apparent progress in de—
veloping profile—to—profile comparison methods, some problems re—
main. Alignment accuracy, one of the most important challenges in
homology modeling (Venclovas and Margeleviéius, 2009), seems to
have saturated recently (Kryshtafovych et al., 2014) and further im—
provements in alignment necessitate.

Enhancing the description of substitution probabilities so that
the probabilities accurately reflect a structure/sequence environment
(context) addresses the problem. Biegert and Soding (2009) showed
that generalizing substitution probabilities for each position by mix—
ing them with a library of context profiles has increased the sensitiv—
ity of the profile—to—sequence alignment method PSI—BLAST
(Altschul et al., 1997) by more than 64%. The context profiles—
representative profile fragments—were not derivatives of structure
information but derived from clustering profile fragments. The ra—
tionale of using sequence—based contexts was that the profile frag—
ments with different distributions of substitution probabilities could
adopt similar local structures. If grouped together, these profile frag—
ments would lose their specificity.

Biegert and Soding (2009) modeled the profile fragment by using
the product of weighted multinomial probabilities and optimized
the substitution probabilities of each context profile with the
Expectation Maximization algorithm. In that framework, the num—
ber of context profiles is a parameter whose value was found in a
homology detection benchmark procedure.

In this work, we aim at increasing the sensitivity of profile com—
parisons and the accuracy of alignments, addressing the issue of
profile contexts (Supplementary Fig. 51) from a Bayesian non—
parametrics perspective. We propose a hierarchical Dirichlet process
mixture model to describe the distribution of profile contexts
and apply the inferred mixtures to the problem of protein homology
detection. The hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) is developed (Teh
et 41., 2006) for model—based clustering of grouped data, where each
group is associated with a mixture model. The essential property of
the HDP is that it employs a Dirichlet process (DP) for every group of
data, where all the DPs share a base distribution which itself is drawn
from a Dirichlet process. Such a construction enables sharing of clus—
ters across groups and expresses the property of profiles (sequence
families) of sharing common features. Considering profiles as separate
groups, the HDP mixture model formalizes the purpose of finding
characteristic clusters of contexts within each profile with sharing of
the clusters among them. An important feature of the HDP mixture
model is that the number of clusters is unknown and is to be inferred
from the data in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling.
Overgeneralization of profile contexts leads to signal loss and reduced
specificity, and this feature allows to avoid of selecting a particular
number of clusters or placing an explicit parametric prior on it.

To our knowledge, HDP—based non—parametric Bayesian models
to define the distribution of profile contexts or substitution proba—
bilities have not been considered in the literature. Nguyen et a].
(2013), though, modeled multiple sequence alignment (MSA) col—
umns with DP Dirichlet mixtures. They specified residue frequencies
at single columns by a Dirichlet distribution and inferred the
Dirichlet mixtures from MSA data. Although computationally con—
venient, such a specification has some limitations. One is that a
multivariate random variable drawn from a Dirichlet distribution
corresponds to a scaled vector of independently distributed gamma
random variables. The Dirichlet distribution, therefore, lacks versa—
tility to capture inter—component correlations as illustrated in Figure
S2 of the Supplementary Materials.

We build the model to handle profile data. The profile general—
izes each MSA column with a vector of substitution probabilities,

which depending on sequence weighting scheme, embody soft
dependencies between adjacent columns. With these properties, sub—
stitution probabilities in our setting constitute an observation vector.
To control correlations between residues, we model the distribution
of substitution probabilities with a logistic—normal distribution
(Aitchison and Shen, 1980), which follows from the logistic trans—
formation applied to a normal distribution and, to the best of our
knowledge, publicly has not been considered to characterize proba—
bilities in profiles. The context (Supplementary Fig. 51) comprises
an array of such vectors and is a random variable whose distribution
the proposed mixture model describes. The model is valid for
contexts of any length. Although, in this work, we confine to the
context of one position, Section 5 discusses how the model without
any corrections adapts to longer contexts.

2 Methods

2.1 Bayesian mixture model
This section defines the distribution of profile contexts. Let us con—
sider, without loss of generality (see Section 5 for a discussion of the
general case), a context of length one, i.e. consisting of a single vec—
tor of substitution probabilities. The positive real—valued substitu—
tion probabilities for all 20 residues sum to 1, but only A : 19 of
them are independent. We assume the A—dimensional vector
f : (f1, . . . ,fA)T, fAH : 1 — 22:17}, of substitution probabilities
to be distributed according to a logistic—normal distribution, which
is defined on the strictly positive simplex (Aitchison and Shen,
1980). The requirement of strictly positive probability values is al—
ways met as profile substitution probabilities result from mixing
observed residue frequencies with pseudo—counts (Altschul et al.,
2009). The inverse logistic transformation applied to f . log(f/fA+1),
produces a normally distributed variable 1] : (I11. . . . .I1A)T. We thus
focus on the distribution of the normal variables.

Let i indexes each context within a particular profile /,
j : 1, . . . ,R. Then, profile contexts 11,-,- : (111,1. . . ..I1/-,-A)T are assumed
to arise as draws from a normal distribution. We place prior distri—
butions on the parameters of the mean vector 11,-,- and covariance ma—
trix )2),- of the normal variable mi. The prior distribution for the
covariance matrix 2,; is specified as an inverted Wishart distribution
with v0 +A + 1 (v0 > A — 1) degrees of freedom and scale matrix
A0, and for the mean vector 11,-,- as a normal distribution with mean
vector [10 and covariance matrix Eﬁ/Ko scaled by real K0 > 0:

2,71%er N 1WA(vo +A + LAO):
ﬂjilﬂotzﬁtko NNA<F072ﬁ/K0)' (11)

The parameter vector 0;, : (pji,):,~,~) of each profile context 11,-,-
can be regarded as being itself a random variable, and their values,
in particular, are not necessarily distinct.

Commonly, profiles share contexts (local features), including
even those representing proteins or their families from different
classes. Moreover, similar contexts can appear multiple times within
the same profile, and the extent of similar contexts depends on and
varies across profiles. To include these properties in our model, we
first introduce a prior distribution G, for the parameters (0/1. 0/2. . . 
of the corresponding context observations (II/1.1112. . . .), unique to
each profile i. We assume that the parameters are conditionally inde—
pendent given G,, and G, itself is a random probability measure dis—
tributed as a Dirichlet process (Ferguson, 1973), DP(ro, Go), with
concentration parameter ‘50 and base probability measure Go for the
parameters (0/1.0;2. . .  The discrete nature of the G, (Ferguson,
1973) allows context sharing within profile i by associating context

observations with the same values of the parameters 0;,. To permit
sharing across profiles, the G0 is modeled as a global random prob—
ability measure also distributed according to a DP with concentra—
tion parameter y and base probability measure F. Now, the base
measure F provides the prior distribution for the parameters 0;,
across all profiles.

According to this setting, known as the hierarchical Dirichlet
process (Teh et al., 2006), the distribution G0 varies around the
prior F and the G, around the Go, Where the hyperparameters y and
‘50, respectively, control the amount of variability at the two hier—
archical levels. Exactly this sharing of the parameter atoms (values)
by both the global probability measure G0 and the distribution G,
assigned its own set of weights for those parameters at the profile
level (Supplementary Fig. S3), that makes the HDP model different
from the corresponding DP model that provides all profiles with a
single global set of weights. We show in the simulation study in
Section 2.3 that the HDP model significantly outperforms its DP
counterpart.

Under the assumptions above, we have the following HDP mix—
ture model:

(3011/71: N DP(V7F), (31110430 N DP(To, Go),
9/ilG/ N G17 11,2191 NNA(9/i)- (22)

As follows from the connection of the DP with a Polya urn scheme
(Blackwell and MacQueen, 1973), the probability for 0;, to take an
already observed value, given all the other random variables {0;,-1b,,
and the base measure F, where the G, and Co have been integrated
out, is proportional to the size of the cluster containing variables
with the given value. We have the hierarchical arrangement of the
DPs, and the clustering property exhibits at both levels.

Consider, first, the top—level DP in (2.2). Let (151.. . . .¢K denote
iid random variables corresponding to K distinct values of the par—
ameters {0;,},.,, distributed according to F. Let also ¢,1.....¢,.m,
over all j be a Polya sequence (Blackwell and MacQueen, 1973) of
random variables with parameter y and probability measure F,
where 111;. is the number of these variables in profile /. Then, the con—
ditional distribution of up], given {up}, },,:7,, and F is

and takes a new value from F with probability proportional to y (we
refer the interested reader to Teh et al., 2006, for a detailed descrip—
tion of the HDP).

At the lower level of the DPs, in each profile / individually, we
obtain the conditional distribution of the random variable 0;, given

ters associated with value (15,, in profile / while 11,,z records the overall
number of 0;, in these clusters in profile /. Local clusters are con—
nected across all profiles through sharing the atoms (bk that deter—
mine global clusters. In other words, according to the model (2.2),
profile context observations 11;, associated with parameters 0;, group
into clusters within each profile i, which are mutually connected
among all profiles. This scheme of the HDP is equivalent to the
Chinese restaurant franchise metaphor presented by Teh et al.
(2006).

Note that the iid variables {0;,}, are exchangeable and hence
(2.4) and (2.5) are applicable for all i. We exploit this property in
posterior inference.

2.2 Inference

Let us introduce the indicator variables {2;,},, and {x;,},.,. The vari—
able 2;, indicates local cluster I in profile i, with which the observation
vector 1],, is associated: 2;, : (j. 1) implies 0;, : 10],. Whereas 14;, pro—
vides the index k of the global cluster involving local cluster I in profile
/: 11;, : k implies 10,, : (bk. Exploiting that the 2;, and 14;, exhibit the
same exchangeability properties as the corresponding variables 0;, and
$1,, our MCMC sampling scheme deals with the indicator variables.
A single iteration of the posterior sampling algorithm consists of the
following steps: 1. Update 2;, for all j and i. 2. Update 14;, for all j and
l. 3. Perform Metropolis updates repeatedly for a number of times. 4.
Update the hyperparameters y, ‘50, KO and U0. Section 51 of the
Supplementary Materials describes each step in detail, introduces a
split—merge algorithm implementing the Metropolis updates in step 3,
and presents a parallel MCMC sampling algorithm.

2.3 Simulation study

Section S2 of the Supplementary Materials investigates the perform—
ance of the MCMC sampling procedure defined in Section 2.2. We
constructed K : 200 distinct clusters each containing 11.,z : 200 ob—
servations generated from a logistic—normal distribution. We
grouped all observations into R2200 groups (profiles), initiated
three MCMC sequences initialized with three different starting con—
figurations, and performed convergence diagnostics. The MCMC se—
quences converged. We obtained a strong correlation between the
estimated and true values of the parameters used to generate the
data. Section S2 also demonstrates (Supplementary Fig. SS) the ad—
vantage of using the HDP mixture model over the corresponding DP
mixture model for our experiments. We refer the reader to Section
S2 for a detailed discussion of the experiments.

3 Model application

The application of the mixture model (Section 2.1) to protein hom—
ology detection consists of several parts. First, we compose a large
collection of non—redundant data of profile contexts. Next, we infer

ﬁm'sreumol‘pquo'sopcuuowtotq/ﬁdnq

the model parameters from the data. Then we apply the model to de—
rive scores to be incorporated into a comparison of profiles. Lastly,
we evaluate the effect of the model—derived scores on the sensitivity
and alignment quality of the profile—to—profile comparisons. To ac—
complish all these steps, we developed profile construction and com—
parison applications which combined the main features of the
methods COMA (Margelevicius and Venclovas, 2010) and
HHsearch (Soding, 2005). The features include the profile construc—
tion protocol and compositional adjustments of the first method,
and transition probabilities in the context of hidden Markov model
(HMM) and log—sum—of—odds scoring of the second one. We call the
new method COMER (profile COMparER).

The first two steps, that is how the profile context data were
compiled and the inference process, are described in Section S3.1.
We obtained a final set of R : 49 332 profiles, where R also cor—
responds to the number of groups in the HDP mixture model. For
each profile/ : 1. . . . .R, a number of contexts, proportional to the
profile length, were randomly sampled, contributing to a total of
11... : 991 833 distinct observations. We ran the sampler on the
data and found a maximum likelihood estimate of the state, 6"”,
with the number of global clusters K : 1260 and the total number
of local clusters 111.. : 962 446. The distributions of observations
in most populated clusters, as expected, approach multivariate
normal distributions. Supplementary Figure S7 represents the most
populated cluster.

We emphasize that clusters are characterized by the parameters
of the t—distribution, calculated purely from data (Appendix A.1).
No fit of parameters to the data takes place. Note also that the num—
bers of clusters were inferred from the data. We employ the mixture
model corresponding to the state 6"” for deriving scores. (State sam—
ples around the maximum likelihood state 6"” yielded similar results

opt

[Section 4], meaning that c is stable with the majority of clusters

being of high likelihood [Supplementary Fig. 56].)

3.1 Derivation of scores

Since our evaluation system (see Section 4) is based on the assess—
ment of the quality of generated protein 3D structural models, we
aim at improving the accuracy of profile alignments by deriving the
scores from structural information as follows. For each sequence
from a subset of protein domains with known 3D structures from
the SCOP database (Murzin et al., 1995) (version 1.71) filtered to
20% sequence identity, we calculated profiles from MSAs obtained
by running 2 iterations of HMMER3 (Eddy, 2011) against the
UniRef50 (The UniProt Consortium, 2014) sequence database. For
every position of each of 4611 built profiles, the posterior distribu—
tion of cluster membership for the context 11* characterizing a single
profile position was computed in this way: The posterior probability
for 11* to belong to global cluster k is p(1<* : k)11*. c°Pt.H) o<
p(1<* : klcopt)p(11*)Hk), where 1/.* is an indicator variable for 11*, H
denotes the complete set of observations, Hk is a matrix of the ob—
servations associated with cluster k, p(11*)Hk) represents a t—distribu—
tion (see Section S1.1 and Appendix A.2 of the Supplementary
Materials), and p(1<* : kid“) is the prior probability of mixture
component k. For 11;.. does not vary greatly across all profiles 1', we
approximate 11;.. : 11.../R and calculate p(1<* : 1616‘“) by averaging
the prior probability of mixture component k over all 1'. Then, using
(2.5), we get (see Section $32 for the derivation)

PM = Uln*,c“Pt,H)
{ l"»»k(m» + V) + RfomklPWlHk) if U I k,
0(

Rrovpor) if u 2 16,

where [6* denotes an unrepresented (new) global cluster, and p(11*) is
the prior probability of 11* distributed as the t—distribution ($1.7)
defined in Section 51.2 of the Supplementary Materials. Note that
while (3.1) predicts global cluster membership, the structure of local
clusters is taken into account by the variables 111,1.

Next, the 4611 protein domains were compared all against all
with DALI (Holm et al., 2008), a method for pairwise comparison
of protein structures. Using only statistically significant matches
(DALI Z—score 2 3) of the pairwise structural alignments (duplicate
pairs were removed), we derived MSAs for each domain and
weighted (Henikoff and Henikoff, 1994) sequences within each
MSA to reduce redundancy. Having computed by (3.1) the distribu—
tion predicting cluster membership for a context for each position of
the sequences in the MSAs, we calculated weighted frequencies of
cluster pairs that had arisen from the aligned sequences in the
MSAs. Each sequence position, though, considered a single cluster
determined by arg max,,17(1<* : U)n*.c°Pt.H). In addition, to ensure
a reliable subset of the data, we analyzed the aligned positions which
had paired residues in a structural superposition and predicted clus—
ters with probability at least 0.5. The score of having aligned clus—
ters x and 3! was then calculated as log[(fxy +fyx)/(2gxgy)], where
fxy is the weighted frequency of occurrence for pair x, y and
gx : 2y fxy. We thus obtained a K X K score table (see Section $33
for more details and discussion of the validation of the scores).

The comparison of a pair of profiles employs the score table for
each pair of positions of two profiles, considered for producing an
alignment, where a pair of cluster indices defined as described above
selects an entry from the score table. The selected score is down—
weighted and is added to the total score used to score a pair of
profile positions. We emphasize that while the posterior inference
process is computationally intensive, the application of the scores is
fast and does not take significant time in profile comparison.

4 Results

To evaluate the efficiency of the derived scores, we performed an ex—
tensive comparison of sequence profiles of protein domains. Protein
domains served as an evaluation basis for two reasons. First, avail—
able 3D domain structures enable to assess reliably the accuracy of
profile alignments, a major determinant in protein modeling.
Second, domain sequences used to produce profiles reduce the prob—
ability of the homologous over—extension error (Gonzalez and
Pearson, 2010) leading to a deterioration of the quality of profiles.
Here, the dataset comprised the protein domains from the SCOPe
database (Fox et al., 2013) (version 2.03) filtered to 20% sequence
identity to challenge remote homology detection. The resulting do—
mains excluding the members of class g of small proteins were div—
ided evenly into training and test set of 4916 and 4915
representatives, respectively. Training set was used to optimize the
application parameters (weights) for the score table, while the test
set to assess the performance on previously unseen data. Multiple se—
quence alignments for the construction of profiles for domain se—
quences from both sets resulted from searching each sequence with
PSI—BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997) (version 2228+) using a se—
quence inclusion threshold of 10_5 and soft masking of low com—
plexity regions for 6 iterations against the UniRef5 0 sequence
database (downloaded 10/24/2013).

Our benchmark tests included three additional profile—to—profile
comparison methods: HHsearch (Soding, 2005) (version 2.0.16,
released 2013), PPAS (Yan et al., 2013) from the I—TASSER software
package (Roy et al., 2010) and FFAS (Jaroszewski et al., 2011). (We

wanted to include more state—of—the—art methods into the benchmark,
but most of them are designed as internet servers or do not distribute
computer utilities to make profiles from user—supplied MSAs.) All the
methods except FFAS exploit secondary structure (SS) predictions.
The new method COMER and HHsearch incorporated SS predictions
obtained by PSIPRED (Jones, 1999). Whereas SS predictions calcu—
lated by PSSpred from the I—TASSER package accompanied the PPAS
sequence profiles. For each method, we constructed profiles using the
same set of MSAs, compared the profiles all against all, and evaluated
the sensitivity of detecting related protein pairs and the accuracy of
the produced alignments. We found that HHsearch performed better
with the option of posterior probability threshold for maximum ac—
curacy alignment set to 0.3 (—mact 0.3). The evaluation thus used this
option value for HHsearch. In addition, as HHsearch employs 13
—length contexts in comparison of profiles, we evaluated the effect of
calculating contexts by both methods COMER and HHsearch.

Each method was evaluated by considering top—ranked profile
alignments sorted by reported their statistical significance. Only one
of two alignments between the same pair of different domains, that
with higher statistical significance, was retained. Alignments be—
tween identical domains were removed.

4.1 Sensitivity

Although the SCOPe database used here for the dataset of protein do—
mains classifies domains into the families, superfamilies, folds and
classes, we do not trust the classification blindly in our evaluation.
Protein domains in SCOP(e) are classified according to the criteria of
common evolutionary origin and structural similarity. However, the
protein structure space, as a number of studies have shown (see, e.g.
Sadreyev et al., 2009), is continuous, meaning that one could expect
to discover many relationships between proteins, conﬂicting with
those established in the classification. We thus consider a pair of
aligned domains as a correct match (true positive, TP) if the domains
belong to the same superfamily or their structural similarity by DALI
is statistically significant (Z—score 2 2). Otherwise, the relationship
implied by an aligned pair is considered spurious (false positive, FP).

Figure 1 shows the number of true positives versus the number
of false positives for each evaluated method. The new method
COMER at a false discovery rate of 10% detects 103% more related
pairs than PPAS, 16% than FFAS and 8% than HHsearch. By a per—
mutation test for unpaired data (Venkatraman, 2000), the COMER
curve in the figure differs significantly from the curves of the other
methods at the 1% level. The scores derived from describing unit—
length contexts by the model (2.2) increased the sensitivity of
COMER for the top 60 000 alignments by 5.3%. In contrast, for
the same amount of top alignments, HHsearch advanced by 2.5%
by computing 13—length contexts.

Additionally, to prevent from any possible misinterpretations
related to classifying pairwise alignments as false positives, we con—
sidered each aligned pair of structurally dissimilar (DALI
Z—score < 2) domains from different superfamilies but from the
same fold as being of unknown relationship. Ignoring these ‘un—
known” relationships ensures that possibly related pairs from the
same fold, which by definition groups structurally similar superfami—
lies, are not wrongly classified as errors. The revised results, shown in
Figure 510 of the Supplementary Materials, display no major change
in sensitivity for the methods, meaning that among the top profile
alignments, there are few aligned pairs belonging to different superfa—
milies but the same fold and for which DALI Z—score < 2.

A more stringent criterion for a true positive, formulated as the
requirement for a pair to belong to the same superfamily or to have

False Positives, ><103

Fig. 1. True positives against false positives for the new method COMER and
the other evaluated methods. Domain pairs belonging to the same SCOPe
superfamily or sharing statistically significant structural similarity (DALI
Z-score 2 2) are defined as true positives. Other pairs are false positives. The
thin straight line represents a false discovery rate of 10%

a DALI Z—score 2 3, produced a similar picture (Supplementary Fig.
511). The first difference, not surprisingly, is that the methods iden—
tify up to 20% less true positives. Another change (Supplementary
Fig. Sllb) is that under the alternative consideration of false posi—
tives (pairs from the same fold but different superfamilies, with
DALI Z—score < 3 are ignored), the relative difference in sensitivity
between the methods COMER and HHsearch becomes smaller. We
observed from the analysis of the sensitivity and alignment quality
that the inferred mixture model (2.2) particularly increased sensitiv—
ity to remote homology. This could account for the reduced differ—
ence between COMER and HHsearch when the definition for true
positives is adjusted to closer homology.

We now shortly discuss PPAS lagging behind the other methods
by a large margin in all the TP—vs.—FP plots. PPAS is a semi—global
alignment method, which aligns two sequences over their entire
length and is primarily designed for modeling whole proteins.
Since (semi—)global alignments are well known to be less sensitive
than local alignments, this could be one of the reasons of the lag of
PPAS.

4.2 Alignment quality

A reference—free evaluation framework based on structural models
(Margelevicius and Venclovas, 2010) was used to evaluate the qual—
ity of the profile alignments. According to this framework, an align—
ment between a pair of domains is considered to be of high quality if
the most accurate of two 3D models generated for each domain
(using the other domain as a template) is similar to the real
structure.

We used MODELLER (Sali and Blundell, 1993) (version 9.4) to
generate a 3D model based on a profile alignment and TM—score
(Zhang and Skolnick, 2004) to evaluate the structural similarity be—
tween the model and the real structure. TM—score ranges from 0 to 1
with values 2 0.4 indicating a statistically significant similarity and
hence implying a high—quality alignment. A profile alignment is
assumed to be of low—quality if TM—score < 0.2, a characteristic
value for a random pair. Alignments generating TM—score values be—
tween 0.2 and 0.4 are considered of neither high— nor low—quality

and are ignored. Yet, to evaluate all top-ranked alignments, we pro-
vide a complementary analysis.

Importantly, the evaluation framework relies on two modes,
local and global. The global mode evaluates the alignment with re-
spect to the entire protein domain, whereas the local mode along the
alignment extent. The global mode outweighs a performance gain in
the local mode if profile comparison methods produce too short
alignments, but it does not penalize over-extension of alignments.
From the opposite position, the local mode counterbalances too
long alignments tolerated by the global mode, but it allows under-
extension of alignments. Hence, the analysis only under both modes
provides a comprehensive evaluation of the quality of alignments.

Figure 2(A,B) shows the number of high-quality versus low-qual-
ity alignments in the local and global evaluation modes for top-
ranked alignments sorted by their statistical significance. The new
method COMER at a rate of low-quality alignments of 1% in the
local mode produces 366% more high-quality alignments than
PPAS, 181% than FFAS and 35% than HHsearch. In the global
mode, at a rate of low-quality alignments of 10%, COMER pro-
duces 2% more high-quality alignments than PPAS and 11% than
HHsearch, but 4% less than FFAS. Calculating unit-length contexts
increased the rate of high-quality alignments for COMER by 10%
and 2% in the local and global modes, respectively. Whereas, by
computing 13ilength contexts, HHsearch benefited from the 5%
and 2% increase in the local and global modes, respectively.

The figure reveals all the methods competing in the global mode.
In the local mode, as FFAS and PPAS generate long alignments, their
performance falls behind. Trying to equalize the conditions for all
the methods, we set up the methods COMER and HHsearch (its op-
tion -mact 0) to extend their alignments maximally (FFAS does not
provide such a control). This set up does not affect the sensitivity.

Fig. 2. Alignment quality of COMER and the other evaluated methods in the
(A,C) local and (ED) global evaluation modes. In (C) and (D), the methods
COMER and HHsearch (-mact 0) maximally extend their alignments. A high-
quality alignment is that producing a structural model of TM-score 2 0.4.
TM-score < 02 corresponds to a low-quality alignment. Alignments generat-
ing 0.2 g TM-score < 0.4 are ignored. The thin straight line represents an
error rate of 1% in the local mode (A,C) and 10% in the global mode (8D). A
nearly equal number of alignments are evaluated in both modes

The results are shown in Figure 2(C,D). The picture is now opposite:
The methods compete in the local mode (except PPAS) but in the
global. In the global mode, at a rate of low-quality alignments of
10%, COMER produces 102% more high-quality alignments than
PPAS, 90% than FFAS and 6% than HHsearch.

Figure 2 demonstrates that COMER compares favorably with
the other methods when either local alignment or (semi-)global
alignment over the entire protein length is emphasized.
Nevertheless, we reconsidered the alignments produced by the meth-
ods to include into the analysis those inducing TM-score values be-
tween 0.2 and 0.4. Particularly, we were interested in the rate of
high-quality alignments (TM-score 2 0.4) against all other align-
ments (TM-score < 0.4), although shifting the threshold TM-score
to a value of 0.45 or 0.35 yielded similar results. The results ob-
tained without and with setting up COMER and HHsearch to max-
imally extend their alignments (Figs S12 and S13 of the
Supplementary Materials, respectively) are similar to those shown in
Figure 2. However, in the local mode, COMER focused on local
alignment (Supplementary Fig. S12a) outperforms the other meth-
ods by a smaller margin than in Figure 2A. It means that COMER
still produces a rather large amount of alignments falling into the
TM-score interval [0.2; 0.4). This interval of TM-score values
mainly corresponds to inter-fold relationships of proteins, some of
which are remotely homologous or sharing local or global structural
similarity. Figure 1 illustrates that some out of that amount of the
COMER alignments represent those true positives.

4.2.1 Alignment quality of true positives

To examine the alignment quality of true positives and the impact on
it of the model (2.2) describing profile contexts, we plot in Figure 3

modes for the true positives out of the top 90 000 alignments of each
method. The definition of true positives matches that in Figure 1.
The amount of true positives with a high—quality alignment
(TM—score 2 0.4) the new method COMER produces in the local
mode (Fig. 3A) constitutes 57% of the top alignments. This is 111%
more than PPAS, 46% than FFAS and 8% than HHsearch. By calcu—
lating contexts, COMER increased the number of true positives at—
taining alignments of TM—score 2 0.4 and TM—score 2 0.2 by 3%
and 4%, respectively (Fig. 3A and B). The corresponding increase for
HHsearch is 2%.

Because of producing local alignment rather than (semi—)global, a
large mass of the COMER alignments evaluated in the global mode
(Fig. 3B) scores TM—score < 0.4. However, when COMER is set up
to extend its alignments, in the global evaluation mode it yields 39%
high—quality alignments, as illustrated in Figure 3D. This value is
50% greater than high—quality alignments produced by PPAS, 56%
than that by FFAS and 5% than that by HHsearch (—mact 0). If we
additionally take into the account the remotely homologous true
positives that mainly come into the analysis at a lower statistical sig—
nificance level and occupy the TM—score range [0.2; 0.4), then
COMER’s improvement with respect to PPAS is 60% more true
positives aligned with TM—score 2 0.2, 34% with respect to FFAS
and 10% with respect to HHsearch. Narrowing down the definition
of true positives by increasing the DALI Z—score threshold to 3 pro—
vides a similar COMER’s improvement in alignment quality over the
other methods in the local and global modes (Figs S14 and S15 of the
Supplementary Materials).

4.3 Homology examples

COMER significantly detected a number of pairs of homologous
protein domains that were not identified by the other three
methods among their top 90 000 alignments. Here we provide two
examples.

The first pair involves the chain (SCOP ID d11twa-) of putative
transcriptional activator and that of the ribonucleotide reductase R2
(a'1mxra_). Although the chains are representatives of different
SCOP folds a.132 and a.25, respectively, clearly they share the same
topology (Supplementary Fig. Sl6a). The homologous relationship
between the two chains is confirmed by the ECOD evolutionary
classification of protein domains (Cheng et al., 2014). ECOD as—
signs them to the same homology group and also to the same top—
ology group of Heme oxygenase/Ribonucleotide reductase.

The other example relates 2—keto—3—deoxy—6—phosphogluconate
aldolase (a'1wa3a_) to the uncharacterized protein YagE (a'3112xa_).
SCOP (version 1.75) does not characterize the latter protein, but
SCOPe categorizes both domains into the same superfamily of
Aldolase, c.1.10. They exhibit the topology of TIM barrels
(Supplementary Fig. Sl6b) and share the same homology and top—
ology groups in the ECOD classification.

4.4 Evaluation on the basis of changed inputs

In this section, we evaluate the methods given a different set of
MSAs that originated from searching the same domain sequences
with HHblits (Remmert et al., 2012) (version 2.0.16) using default
settings for three iterations against the UniProt20 database of profile
HMMs (06/2015). Having MSAs built on pairwise comparisons of
profile HMMs allows one to examine how the methods perform
when they operate with the more accurate input MSAs. We eval—
uated the sensitivity of each method and the quality of the align—
ments produced by each method in the same way as described above
and summarize the results below.

4.4.1 Sensitivity

COMER at a false discovery rate of 10% (Supplementary Fig. 517)
detects 84% more true positives than PPAS, 21% than FFAS and
14% than HHsearch.

4.4.2 Alignment quality

The more accurate MSAs caused a substantial increase in alignment
accuracy for the methods (Supplementary Fig. 518). We thus sum up
at the following rates of low—quality alignments. COMER at a rate
of low—quality alignments of 0.2% in the local mode
(Supplementary Fig. 518a) produces 300% more high—quality align—
ments than PPAS, 229% than FFAS and 60% than HHsearch. In the
global mode having COMER and HHsearch set up to extend their
alignments (Supplementary Fig. 518d), at a rate of low—quality align—
ments of 1%, COMER yields 101% more high—quality alignments
than PPAS, 86% than FFAS and 20% than HHsearch.

The amount of true positives with a high—quality alignment
(TM—score 2 0.4) COMER produces in the local mode
(Supplementary Fig. 519a) constitutes 65% of the top 90 000 align—
ments. This is 99% more than PPAS, 57% than FFAS and 7% than
HHsearch.

That amount in the global mode with the setup of extended
alignments (Supplementary Fig. Sl9d) is 50% of the top 90 000
alignments. This is 59% more than PPAS, 63% than FFAS and 6%
than HHsearch (—mact 0).

4.5 A test on CASP targets

Section 4 has heretofore described the evaluation of the methods
based on the protein domains from the SCOPe database. Some do—
mains, however, represent a part of the protein chain, and some of
them may inadequately reflect practical situations of structure pre—
diction. We thus tested COMER and the other methods on full—
length sequences by a procedure similar to that applied for assessing
structure prediction methods in CASP experiments.

We used all 85 CASP11 (2014) regular target sequences with
available 3D structures. 3D models of the targets were generated
using structural templates identified by each method and evaluated
with TM—score. A database of templates corresponding to a release
of the PDB database (Berman et al., 2000) just before the start of
CASP11 (05/01/2014), filtered to 20% sequence identity, equipped
all the methods. Profiles for the target and template sequences were
constructed according to the same operation as described in the be—
ginning of Section 4, implying that the same set of MSAs supplied
each method. The methods COMER and HHsearch were set up to
extend alignments between profiles maximally.

The results obtained by searching the target profiles against the
template profile database and evaluating target 3D models gener—
ated from produced profile alignments are shown in Table 1. The

ments per target for each method

average TM—score of the COMER models is the largest, irrespective
of the number of top alignments per target N (up to 5) considered.
The differences between the average TM—score for COMER and
those for the other methods are not large, but according to
Wilcoxon signed—rank tests, the medians of the differences of the
paired TM—scores for each number of top alignments considered de—
viate significantly from 0 at a confidence level of 95%. It means that
the distributions of TM—scores obtained by using COMER differ
from the distributions obtained by the other methods. In other
words, the methods produce different alignments for the corres—
ponding targets.

Plotting the distribution of TM—scores for COMER against that
for another method reveals (Supplementary Fig. 520) some points cor—
responding to low TM—scores for COMER alignments but higher for
other method’s alignments. The reason is that each method ranks tem—
plates differently, and the same template can be ranked, for instance,
first by one method and third by another. Indeed, the bivariate distri—
butions of TM—scores become more condensed after sorting the top
alignments of each method according to TM—score a posteriori
(Supplementary Fig. 521). Several outliers (colored dark red in
Supplementary Fig. 521) for which COMER scores low correspond to
the same target T0852 for which many templates can be detected at a
statistically significant level. COMER ranked more closely related
templates below the top 5. Clearly, better ranking of templates could
improve all the methods (see Table 1, Supplementary Figs 520 and
521), but this is a complex problem that can be addressed in many dif—
ferent ways and is beyond the scope of this study. Interestingly, after
reranking the top alignments, the distribution of TM—scores for
COMER still differs significantly from those for the other methods at
the 95% confidence level, irrespective of N : 1, . . . ,5, with the high—
est average quality of 3D models (Table 1).

In the end, we emphasize that this test does not unveil how the
methods would have performed in CASP11. A system specifically
designed for protein homology modeling would require a more elab—
orate computational pipeline covering regular update of data, in—
spection of the quality of profiles, selection of appropriate templates
given profile alignments, modeling by combining multiple templates,
and other routines. This test just demonstrates the relative perform—
ance of the methods under equal conditions on the targets for which
a limited number of templates are available.

5 Discussion

Highly important in many fields of biomedical research, protein
homology modeling relies on protein sequence alignments.
Alignments of high quality stimulate discovery of evolutionary
related matches and thus are key to sensitivity to homologous pro—
teins and, consequently, homology modeling itself. In this study, we
have addressed the problem of protein remote homology detection
by improving the quality of alignments between protein sequence
families represented by sequence profiles. Modeling profile contexts,
fixed—length profile fragments representing the environment of se—
quence families, previously undertaken by Biegert and Soding
(2009), has been engaged to achieve this goal.

We have proposed an HDP mixture model to describe the distri—
bution of contexts, where a logistic—normal distribution is used to
model substitution probabilities in profile contexts to capture depend—
encies between amino acids. We have inferred the HDP mixtures
from a large set of profile context data by combining Gibbs sampling
with Metropolis updates. The Metropolis updates exploited to over—
come the inefficiency of Gibbs sampling were implemented by a split—

merge algorithm (Jain and Neal, 2004), which we have adapted for
the HDP mixture model. K : 1260 distinct context clusters have
been obtained by applying a parallel MCMC sampling algorithm de—
veloped to speed up posterior inference. We have developed profile
construction and comparison computer utilities and, with respect to
the inferred mixtures, derived scores, which we integrated into an ex—
tensive profile—to—profile comparison.

Evaluating results by generating protein 3D models for each align—
ment between a pair of profiles and measuring the similarity between the
model and the native structure, we have demonstrated that adding the
scores increased the number of accurate 3D models, and consequently
the number of accurate alignments, in both evaluation modes: with re—
spect to the entire protein domain (global), key to protein structure pre—
diction, and within the alignment boundaries (local), important to
sensitivity. A benchmark of the new method COMER, available under
the GNU GP License v3, with three other profile—to—profile comparison
methods shows a significant improvement in both sensitivity and align—
ment quality, and an improvement from calculating unit—length contexts
is twice that of the HHsearch method employing 13—length contexts.

Although this study confined to unit—length contexts, the HDP
mixture model is applicable for longer contexts. The context consist—
ing of S vectors of A substitution probabilities transformed by the in—
verse logistic transformation can be represented by an A X S matrix
X. The random matrix X will have a matrix variate normal distribu—
tion with mean matrix M and covariance matrices )2 (A X A) and ‘l’
(S X S), or equivalently, vec(XT) ~ NAs(vec(MT), )2 ® ‘1’). The mix—
ture model (2.2) applied to 11 E vec(XT) will then describe the distri—
bution of S—length contexts, where the conditional distributions and
the MCMC sampling algorithms presented in the study remain valid.
A model that allows for correlations not just between residues but
also between context positions would impart much greater flexibility
in modeling profile contexts and specificity in recognizing structural
contexts. Integrated into comparison of profiles, the model would
very likely increase the sensitivity and accuracy of alignments further.
Accordingly, our further work will investigate how effective longer
contexts under the HDP mixture model are.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Time-lapse imaging in combination with fluorescence
microscopy techniques enable the investigation of gene regulatory
circuits and uncovered phenomena like culture heterogeneity. In this
context, computational image processing for the analysis of single cell
behaviour plays an increasing role in systems biology and mathemat-
ical modelling approaches. Consequently, we developed a software
package with graphical user interface for the analysis of single bac-
terial cell behaviour.

Results: A new software called TLM-Tracker allows for the flexible
and user-friendly interpretation for the segmentation, tracking and
lineage analysis of microbial cells in time-lapse movies.

Availability: The software package, including manual, tutorial video
and examples, is available as Matlab code or executable binaries at
http://www.t|mtracker.tu-bs.de.

1 INTRODUCTION

The discovery of phenotypic variations in clonal microbial popu-
lations led to an increased interest in the investigation of indi-
vidual cell behaviour. It was shown that culture heterogeneity
can be caused by stochastic events at the level of gene expression.
These lead to transient phenotypes up to stable co—existing popu-
lations. Documented examples for bacteria include persistance,
competence and sporulation (Dubnau and Losick, 2006).
However, traditional methods to analyze the dynamics of gene
expression in bacterial communities and cultures including tran-
scriptome and proteome analyses only capture the average of
temporally overlapping expression levels. Deeper insights into
the variability of certain gene regulatory circuits can be achieved
by microscopical visualization of cells expressing appropriate
ﬂuorescence reporters (Meyer and Dworkin, 2007). Hereby, the
complex dynamics of individual cells over time can be visualized
using time-lapse movies. Successive frames in time-lapse movies
offer the possibility to both temporal and spatial analyses of gene
expression including proliferation, differentiation and migration
of cells (Locke and Elowitz, 2009). Rapid advances in live cell
ﬂuorescence microscopy and developments in image processing

allow the computational in vivo tracking and analysis of single
cells (Wu et al., 2008). Commonly used image processing algo-
rithms allow the preprocessing of all frames to optimize size,
brightness and contrast for the identiﬁcation of background
and border regions. In the next step, called segmentation, cells
are recognized as meaningful parts that are separated from the
background. This spatial separation is followed by cell tracking
which is the temporal recognition of cells. In this procedure, cells
are connected over time from frame to frame. During the whole
process, features such as ﬂuorescence intensity, cell dimensions,
growth rate and migration are measured. These data represent
important parameters for mathematical modelling approaches in
systems biology. Several sophisticated approaches to this analysis
were realized in both commercial and open-source software tools
(Hand et al., 2009; Young et al., 2012). However, a program that
combines sophisticated image processing and analysis with an
intuitive application and a high degree of automatization is still
missing.

To close this gap, we developed a new dialogue based inter-
active software package for the analysis of time-lapse movies
called Time-Lapse Movie Tracker (TLM-Tracker). The tool
includes many image preprocessing options and combines them
with well-established segmentation and tracking algorithms.
TLM-Tracker allows both full automatization of the analysis
and manual intervention at every image processing step. We
applied our software in a case study of a green ﬂuorescent pro-
tein (GFP) producing Bacillus megaterium strain.

2 DESCRIPTION

TLM-Tracker was implemented as open-source software using
the Matlab image processing toolbox. It can be run as Matlab
application or as stand-alone program on Windows and Unix
platforms. The software features a user-friendly dialogue based
graphical user interface that enables user interaction at every
processing step (Fig. 1). Additionally, customized processes can
be deﬁned and stored to enable the automatization of image
segmentation functions. The program was designed for the
joint analysis of simultaneously generated brightﬁeld and ﬂuor-
escence image data. Various image and movie formats including
ZVI (Zeiss AxioVision format) are supported. After loading the
images the main workﬂow is divided into four major tasks:
preprocessing, segmentation, tracking and data export.

During the preprocessing, all frames can be cropped, the
brightness can be adjusted to one common level and images

can be removed if they are not suitable for further processing.
Segmentation is the process of partitioning a frame into multiple
segments to detect cells and separate them from the background.
TLM-Tracker provides multiple alternative algorithms for seg-
mentation, namely threshold-based algorithms, watershed trans-
formation and level-set methods that can be applied for each
frame individually. After the segmentation process, several quan-
titative properties of each cell are determined, such as dimension,
position, orientation, cell pole age and area of the cell. Moreover,
the mean, maximum and standard deviation of the ﬂuorescence
intensity of the cell are calculated. In two alternative algorithms,
cells are tracked by searching of overlapping cell areas in the
proceeding frames of the movie. After the cell lineage is deter-
mined, a correction of photobleaching in the ﬂuorescence images
is possible. Finally, derived results can be visualized as lineage
tree and exported as CSV or XLS formatted ﬁle for further
analysis.

Details about segmentation/tracking methods and their appli-
cation are given in the online manual of TLM-Tracker (http://
tlmtracker.tu-bs.de/index.php/Manual).

3 RESULTS

The software package was applied on a growing microcolony of
a GFP producing B. megaterium strain. GFP production is
driven by a xylose inducible promoter (Stammen et al., 2010).
Cell division events and the induction of GFP were analyzed
using the watershed segmentation method in combination with
tracking by overlapping cell areas. The workﬂow was performed

in a completely automated way using predeﬁned processes.
This example clearly documents that the program is capable of
dealing satisfactory with segmentation and tracking (Fig. 1).
Despite TLM-Tracker was developed for the analysis of bacteria,
it may be used for a variety of other cells.

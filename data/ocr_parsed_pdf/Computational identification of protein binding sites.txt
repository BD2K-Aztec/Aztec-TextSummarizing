CGA triplet in a loop and a conserved cytosine six bases away in
another loop has also been shown to be necessary for bud local—
ization of several RNAs (Olivier et al., 2005). Nonetheless, these
criteria are not sufﬁcient to identify all zipcodes (Shepard et al.,
2003). It has been suggested that recognition and transport
depend not only on the zipcodes but also on adjacent sequence
and structural features (Jambhekar et al., 2005). We show that
our extracted features could help distinguish zipcodes from other
regions on the same mRNAs with good accuracy.

There exist experimental methods for transcriptome—wide
identiﬁcation of RNA regions bound by a speciﬁc RNA binding
protein (RBP). The main idea is to crosslink RBPs with RNAs,
followed by immunoprecipitation (CLIP) and microarray ana—
lysis or sequencing. The latter includes methods known as HITS—
CLIP (Licatalosi et al., 2008), CLIP—seq (Sanford et al., 2009),
PAR—CLIP (Hafner et al., 2010) and RIP—seq (Zhao et al., 2010).

As these large—scale datasets become available for more RBPs,
it is interesting to ask whether different RBPs recognize similar
features at their binding sites. It has recently been shown that a
common set of features can be used to identify RNAs targeted by
a group of different RBPs (Pancaldi and Bahler, 2011), although
in the same study it is also shown that if the training set lacks any
known targets of an RBP, the resulting statistical model is less
capable of identifying its targets, indicating that the model may
not have captured the binding site signals recognized by all
RBPs. Here we use our extracted features from RNA struc—
ture—probing data to study this question in a different way, and
ask if it is possible to build statistical models that can distinguish
general RBP binding sites from other regions. Using a whole—
transcriptome dataset of RBP binding sites, we show that such a
model can be constructed with high distinguishing power using a
small set of features, which supports the idea that different RBPs
may share similar recognition signals of their targets.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

The overall workﬂow is illustrated in Supplementary Figure S1. The
following sections provide details of different parts of the workﬂow.

2.1 RNA structure-probing data

We used a published transcriptome-wide structure-probing dataset in
yeast (Kertesz et al., 2010) for our study, as we also had access to
other types of yeast data needed for our study. The experiments that
produced the data involved treatments of two enzymes, namely RNase
V1 and S1 nuclease, which preferentially cleave phosphodiester bonds
3’ of double-stranded RNA and single-stranded RNA, respectively. The
sequencing data from each enzymatic treatment were individually nor-
malized, and the log ratio between the normalized V1 and S1 read counts
at each nucleotide was deﬁned as the PARS (Parallel Analysis of RNA
Structure) score of the 5’ adjacent nucleotide (Kertesz et al., 2010).
Strongly positive and negative PARS scores indicate a high chance for
the nucleotide to be base-paired and single-based, respectively. For sim-
plicity, we will call the number of reads attributed to the structure of a
certain nucleotide its ‘read count’, although these reads start at its
3’ adjacent nucleotide.

2.2 Statistical models

For each enzymatic treatment, we propose a mixture of Poisson linear
model to relate properties of each nucleotide and its observed read count.
Our model is based on a Poisson linear model previously proposed for

counting sequencing reads that start at a particular nucleotide (Li et al.,
2010), which matches the situation of our data:

nij ~ Poissonmij), where

K
1
Inuijzlnm+a+z Z ﬁkhI(biJ-k=h) U

k:1he(A.C.G}

In the equation, nif is the observed read count of nucleotide j of tran-
script i (i.e. the number of reads starting at the nucleotide), which is
distributed according to a Poisson distribution with mean “if. nil- in
turn depends on Hi, the unknown expression level of transcript i, and
biases due to the local sequence within a window of size K centered on
nucleotide j. Both the identity and position of the nucleotides within the
window affect how they inﬂuence the read count of nucleotide j, and their
total inﬂuence is assumed to take on a linear form with offset oz and
coefﬁcients [Bk/7 (no variables are deﬁned for Uracils, as their values can
be ﬁxed at 0), where I(b,»j,‘. = h) is 1 if the k-th nucleotide within the
window is h, and 0 otherwise. The model is general enough to capture
many types of biases due to local sequence features. The values of the
parameters 6 = {#130, [Bk/7} are to be determined such that the following
log-likelihood function is maximized:

For the structure-probing data we used, as an enzyme could have
different probabilities of cleavage for different groups of nucleotides
(such as paired versus unpaired bases), we extend the model by introdu-
cing a mixture of components, with each component representing a group
of nucleotides. The resulting log-likelihood function is as follows:

L(6) = 2111 ZPr(z,,-_g = 1)Pr(n,,-|z,,-_g = 1,9)

where G represents the different components of the mixture model, 2,]; g is
a group membership variable, which equals 1 if nucleotide j of transcript i
belongs to group g and 0 otherwise, rg d=°fPr(z,»J-.g = 1) is the prior prob-
ability that a nucleotide belongs to group g and a“ is the average read
count of nucleotides of transcript i that belong to group g.
Correspondingly, there is a separate set of parameters, Gig and [Bk/Lg for
each group. In this work we consider only two-component models, i.e.
G = {1,2}, as they correspond to some natural assumptions to be dis-
cussed below.

To check the need for considering local sequence biases and for a
mixture model, we also considered two simpler models for comparison
purposes. The ﬁrst one is the original Poisson linear model with only one
component [Equation (1)]. The second one is a Poisson mixture model
that does not consider local sequences, which is equivalent to our model
with Gig and [Bk/Lg all set to zero.

2.3 Optimization algorithms for data ﬁtting

2.3.1 Fitting data from one enzymatic treatment Given a sequen-
cing dataset with a particular enzymatic treatment, we used optimization
algorithms to (locally) maximize the data likelihood of the different
models. For the single-component Poisson linear model, we implemented
the method described in Li et a]. (2010). For our mixture model, we
developed an algorithm based on the expectation-maximization (EM)
framework (Dempster et al., 1977). EM considers three types of data,
which in our case include the observed read counts (X = {nij}), hidden
group membership variables (Z = {zij.g}) and model parameters
(6: {ni.g,ag,ﬁkh.g,rg}). If the values of the hidden variables were
observed, it would be easier to compute data likelihood and ﬁnd

parameter values that maximize it. Because these values are actually
unobserved, the EM procedure instead iteratively maximizes the
expectation of the log-likelihood of the full data,
Em. 61H, [1n Pr(X, Z|6)] = z, [Pr(z|X, 6(”1))1n Pr(X, z|9)], where 90*“ is
the estimated parameter values in the (t — 1)-th iteration. The procedure
repeatedly derives the expression of this expected log-likelihood in the
E-step and ﬁnds values of the parameters that maximize it in the M-step,
until a certain stopping criterion is reached.

For our mixture model, it is possible to derive closed-form formulas
for Ml; g and rg that maximize the expected log-likelihood, but it is difﬁcult
for Gig and [Bk/Lg. Following Li et a]. (2010), we searched for the optimal
values of these two sets of parameters in turn, using closed-form formulas
and numerical methods, respectively. A summary of the whole algorithm
is given below. Detailed derivations can be found in the Supplementary
Materials.

In the algorithm, we ﬁrst initialize variables EU; g to random values, and
mg and rg to corresponding weighted means of them (steps 172). The
algorithm then repeats steps 378 for iterations. In step 3, we ﬁx the values
of pig and Ely-.g using the estimates from the previous iteration, and solve
the resulting Poisson regression problem by iterative reweighting least-
square (Li et al., 2010) to get Gig and [Bk/Lg. In step 4, the variables 2,“ are
formally deﬁned as the expected group membership of nucleotide j of
transcript i based on the parameter estimates in the previous iteration. In
step 5, the values of Ml; g are updated to ones that maximize the expected
log-likelihood expression obtained in the E-step. In step 6, we deﬁne the
group with a smaller mean as group 1, and swap the related parameters if
necessary. In step 7, we update the values of Ig to the ones that maximize
the expected log-likelihood. Finally, in step 8, we check if the change of
deviance is smaller than a threshold, to determine whether to stop the
execution or to enter the next iteration. In practice, the deviance value
converges quickly and the algorithm requires only a small number of
iterations (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).

For the mixture of Poisson model that does not consider local se-
quences, we estimated its parameters by modifying our algorithm with
Gig and [Bk/Lg ﬁxed to zero.

2.3.2 Fitting data from both enzymatic treatments In the algo-
rithm above, we compute an expected group membership value, 2“,
for each nucleotide j. These variables were later used to derive structural
features for our applications in two different ways. The ﬁrst way was to
ﬁt each dataset (V1 and S1) independently and treat the variable from
each as a separate feature. Another way was to coordinately estimate the

parameters for both datasets, with additional constraints imposed on the
variables. The details are given in the Supplementary Materials. Here we
outline the high-level ideas.

We tested two constraints based on two corresponding assumptions.
The ﬁrst assumption is that the two mixture components correspond to
unpaired and paired bases, respectively. Because RNase V1 and S1 nu-
clease have opposite preferences for these two types of bases, we would
expect paired bases to have higher V1 and lower S1 read counts than
unpaired bases. If we deﬁne g: 1 and g = 2 as the groups of unpaired and
paired bases, respectively, we would expect for any transcript i, p,“ < am
for the V1 dataset and p,“ > am for the S1 dataset. In any EM iteration,
we imposed these two conditions as a constraint by swapping the mem-
bership values of the two groups in a dataset if it was violated. We call
this approach coordinated model ﬁtting with opposite group
memberships.

We also tested a different assumption, that in general nucleotides with
more reads in one dataset would also have more reads in the other. This
could be caused by the accessibility of nucleotides in the 3D structure. In
this case, if g=1 and g=2 represent the groups of less accessible and
more accessible nucleotides, respectively, p,“ should be smaller than an
in both datasets for any transcript i. Again, we set these as a constraint
and swapped group memberships if violated. We call this approach coor-
dinated model ﬁtting with consistent group memberships.

For the mixture of Poisson model not considering local sequences, we
ﬁtted the models for the V1 and S1 datasets independently, and used their
2,]; g variables as two separate features. We compared these features with
those from our mixture of Poisson linear models in predicting RNA
zipcodes (see below). As the one-component Poisson linear model does
not have group membership variables, we did not use it to predict RBP
binding sites.

Table 1 summarizes the models we compare in this study.

2.4 Evaluation of ﬁtness to the sequencing data

We measured the goodness-of-ﬁt of a model by its R2, which is deﬁned as
1 — %, where d and do are the deviance of the model and the correspond-
ing null model, respectively (Cameron and Windmeijer, 1996). The devi-
ance compares the likelihood of a model with a full model where each
observation has its own set of parameters. The formulas of R2 for the
various models and their derivations are given in the Supplementary
Materials.

To compare the data ﬁtness resulted from the different models, we
used a 5-fold cross-validation procedure as follows. Each time, we used
the sequences and observed read counts of four-ﬁfth of the genes in our
dataset to perform model ﬁtting and get the optimized parameter values.
We then used the model with these ﬁtted values to predict the read counts
of the remaining one-fifth of genes based on their sequences only. The
predicted and actual read counts were then compared to compute the R2
values. The cross-validation procedure ensures that the reported average
accuracy reﬂects the ability of a model in capturing the general properties
of RNA structures rather than over-ﬁtting the training data, as the latter
would result in low testing accuracy. With 94 962 nt from 119 genes, the
dataset was large enough to ensure the robustness of the 5-fold cross-
validation procedure. For the mixture of Poisson model that does not
consider local sequences, we report the total R2 from cross-validation by
taking the sums of d and do as the total deviances of the model and the
corresponding null model from the ﬁve testing sets, respectively. Our
algorithms in general return models that locally maximize the corres-
ponding likelihood functions, which are related to, but are not equivalent
to, the goodness-of-ﬁt function.

2.5 List of RNA zipcodes

To compare the effectiveness of different types of features in predicting
RNA zipcodes, we collected experimentally veriﬁed zipcodes from two

published studies (Jambhekar et al., 2005; Olivier et al., 2005). After
quality control and intersecting with our structure-probing data
(Supplementary Materials), we obtained a list of 10 zipcodes on 6
genes (Table 2).

2.6 List of protein-RNA binding sites

We further checked if our features can be used to predict general RBP
binding sites. We obtained a whole-transcriptome dataset of RBP-binding
regions in yeast (Freeberg et al., 2013), produced by global photoactiva-
tab1e-ribonucleoside-enhanced cross-linking and immunopuriﬁcation.
We ﬁltered out fragmented regions and focused on those between 10
and 40 bases, which is a range shown to include the majority of binding
sites (Freeberg et al., 2013). The resulting list contains 42 344 RBP-bind-
ing regions on 2972 genes. The nucleotide composition of these regions is
shown in Supplementary Table S3. Because small read counts are more
affected by noise, we considered only transcripts with RPM (reads per
million) >1000 when training and testing the prediction models
(Supplementary Table S4). We also obtained a set of regions bound by
the Puf3p protein from the same study, with 831 binding regions on
668 genes.

2.7 Machine learning and prediction procedures

For the prediction of RNA zipcodes, we deﬁned positive examples as nu-
cleotides within these zipcodes, and negative examples as all other nucleo-
tides from the same RNAs. For each nucleotide, we derived various types
of features ofit (Table 3). PARS is the log ratio of V1 and S1 read counts
(Kertesz et al., 2010). PARS2 is the square of PARS, which indicates
whether a nucleotide is clearly single-based or base-paired. LogVS includes
the logarithm of the V1 and S1 read counts as two separate features.
ProbVS contains the expected group membership variables from one of
our Poisson linear models (to be speciﬁed below). For both the one-com-
ponent model and two-component models that ﬁt V1 and S1 either inde-
pendently or coordinately, there are two features per nucleotide. PredSS2 is
the probability for a nucleotide to be base-paired according to RNAfold
(Hofacker et al., 1994). PredSS3 is an extended version of PredSS2, with
two different labels for bases at the 5’ end and 3’ end of a base pair.
Squinary contains 4 binary features that correspond to whether the nu-
cleotide is A, C, G or U. In addition to the features deﬁned per nucleotide,
we also considered some aggregated features for the whole window, includ-
ing the nucleotide frequencies (SeqRatio), dinucleotide frequencies
(SquiNu) and GC content (SquC).

When producing the ProbVS features using the Poisson linear models,
there is a user parameter, K, that describes the number of nucleotides to
consider around the current nucleotide during model ﬁtting. We tried
multiple values of it and compared the corresponding results.

For general RBP binding sites, due to the experimental procedure used
to produce the dataset we used, the identiﬁed binding sites tend to contain
a large fraction of Uracils (Ting Han, personal communication; see also
the ‘Results’ section). Using a negative training set uniformly sampled
from non-binding regions would result in models that use the enrichment
of Uracils as a core predictor, which is not useful in distinguishing RBP
binding sites from other regions with similar Uracil contents. To over-
come this issue, we constructed the negative set by random permutations
of the nucleotides of the positive examples, with a 1:5 ratio of positive to
negative examples.

When predicting whether a nucleotide is within a RBP binding site, we
used not only its features but also features of the nucleotides around it, to
capture any local feature patterns. We denote by w the total number of
nucleotides the features of which were considered when making predic-
tions for a nucleotide. We tested multiple values of this window size w.
When w = 10, we had 783, 8881 and 19 725 nt as positive examples in the
prediction of RNA zipcodes, general RBP binding sites and binding sites
of Puf3p, respectively.

We used Random Forest (Breiman, 2001) to perform training and pre-
dictions, based on the implementation in the R package randomForest
(http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/randomForest/index.html). We
used the default values of all parameters, except that we set parameter

Computational identification of protein binding sites on RNAs

 

Taking these results together, we conclude that structure—
probing data need to be carefully processed to extract useful
features. Taking simple ratios of the read counts from two dif—
ferent enzymatic treatments or between an experiment with the
corresponding control in a nucleotide—by—nucleotide manner
could eliminate factors that stay largely the same in the experi—
ments being compared, but at the same time some useful infor—
mation may also be removed, such as the solvent accessibility of
each nucleotide.

4.2 Signals for recognizing RNA zipcodes

We have shown that structural features were able to identify
RNA zipcodes with high accuracy. The prediction models were
most accurate when the features of a large number of (~80)
nucleotides were used. Unlike transcription factors that bind
DNA with strong sequence motifs, sequence signatures proposed
for RNA zipcodes have not been able to provide a complete
model (Shepard et al., 2003). Our results suggest that the recog—
nition of RNA zipcodes by the She complex may involve more
complex features from the secondary and tertiary structures
of RNAs. The large number of nucleotides needed for strong
prediction suggests that recognition may be mediated by a
large amount of weak signals.

4.3 General features of protein-RNA binding sites

The encouraging performance of our models in identifying general
protein binding sites suggests that there are some general features
recognized by different RBPs. A next step is to test whether a small
set of common features is shared by most RBPs, or there exist
different classes of RBPs each recognizing different features.

We found that both sequence and structural features could
predict general protein binding sites with high accuracy. The
exact relationship between these two types of features is still
not clear. New insights are needed to elucidate how proteins
interact with both RNA sequences and structures.

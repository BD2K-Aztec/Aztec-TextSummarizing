ABSTRACT

Summary: mimicMe is a web server for prediction and analysis of
host-like proteins (mimics) encoded by microbial pathogens. Users
select a host species and any set of pathogen and control proteomes
(bacterial, fungal, protozoan or viral) and mimicMe reports host-like
proteins that are unique to or enriched among pathogens. Additional
server features include visualization of structural similarities between
pathogen and host proteins as well as function-enrichment analysis.

Availability and implementation: mimicMe is available at http://
mimicme.uwater|oo.ca

1 INTRODUCTION

Many pathogens encode Virulence factors that mimic the func-
tion of one or more host proteins. These host-like proteins, called
mimics, exploit host pathways and/or facilitate evasion of host
immune detection (Bhavsar et al., 2007; Stebbins and Galan,
2001). Mimics may be homologous to their host counterparts,
and originate through host-to-pathogen horizontal transfer, or
may evolve through convergent evolution (Elde and Malik,
2009). Several studies have focused on the latter type, identifying
pathogen mimics of short host peptide fragments (Hagai et al.,
2014; Ludin et al., 2011). Here, we focus on pathogen mimicry
involving host-pathogen sequence homology, which can be more
easily detected through standard bioinformatic approaches.

In previous work, we used a BLAST-based, comparative
proteomics approach to detect mimics of this type in human
pathogenic bacteria (Doxey and McConkey, 2013). By detecting
human-like proteins highly unique to pathogens and relatively
absent in non-pathogens (controls), known mimics [e.g.
Legionella RalF mimicry of human ADP-ribosylation factor
guanine nucleotide exchange factors (ARF—GEFs)], and novel
ones (e.g. multi-species mimics of human collagen and leucine-
rich repeats) could be identiﬁed.

Here, we report mimicMe, a web server for exploration of
host-like proteins and potential mimics in pathogens.
mimicMe automates and extends our previous analysis to in-
clude a range of common host species from mammals to
plants, and pathogens from bacteria, Viruses, protozoans and
fungi. The tool is best suited for predicting mimics that are hom-
ologous to host proteins, but other types of mimicry may be

detected through altered parameters. The tool allows for struc-
tural Visualization of predicted mimicry relationships as well as
function-enrichment analysis to identify host gene families, func-
tions or pathways that are targets of molecular mimicry by
pathogens of interest. We anticipate that the tool will be useful
in comparative analyses of pathogens, where it may serve to
generate hypotheses for future experimental studies.

2 METHODS AND IMPLEMENTATION

2.1 Data sources

Proteome sequence data for selected hosts and microbes were
retrieved from the NCBI’s ftp resource (ftp://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
genomes/) and the NCBI BioProject Database (Barrett et al.,
2012). This included several host species of interest (e.g.
Arabidopsis, human, cow, zebraﬁsh) and 2765 bacterial, 2321
Viral, 35 fungal and 49 protozoan proteomes.

2.2 Host versus microbial proteome BLASTing

For mimicMe to rapidly predict molecular mimicry relationships
in any selection of organisms, proteome-to-proteome alignments
were precomputed for all possible hostemicrobe relationships.
Computations were performed using the blast+ suite
(Camacho et al., 2009) distributed among cluster nodes in
SHARCNET, a high-performance computing network. After
alignment output was parsed, all host and microbial protein
pairs sharing at least one high scoring pair alignment with an
E—Value 5 0.05 were stored in a MongoDB database, along with
corresponding alignment data.

2.3 mimicMe input/output

2.3.] Queries The front end of mimicMe provides a simple web
interface for selecting a host organism, and a set of pathogen
species (where mimics are expected to be found) and control
species (where mimics are not expected). Suggested lists of patho-
gens and controls are also provided as an option. The interface
includes additional parameters to adjust the stringency of predic-
tions, including an E—Value threshold, as well as the minimum
and maximum number of allowed hits in pathogens and non-
pathogens, respectively [see (Doxey and McConkey, 2013) for
more details]. All input parameters are automatically saved as
workﬂows that can be bookmarked in the browser. Common
workﬂows are are included in a section of mimi cMe.

2.3.2 Results The output of a mimicMe analysis is a list of
mimicry target proteins and associated mimics in the input set

of pathogens that meet the speciﬁed criteria. Results are sorted
by pathogen versus non-pathogen abundance and alignment
score, searchable by keyword to focus on functions of interest,
and similar (redundant) predictions are grouped together to
reduce redundancy. PSORTb OK u et £11., 2010) predictions of
subcellular localization are also available for most bacterial
proteins.

3 SAMPLE ANALYSIS AND unucrm FEATURES

As an example analysis, suppose one aims to identify mimics
conserved in multiple species of Legionella that are absent in
broad range of non-pathogens (Fig. 1A). mimicMe predicts a
ranked list of 50 mimicry relationships (Fig. 1B) unique to
Legionella. The top prediction involves detected mimicry of the
Sec7 domain of human ARF-GEFs by the Legionella RalF pro-
tein, a known mimic and Virulence factor, present in 11
Legionella proteomes and 0 controls (Fig. 1B). Further analysis
can be performed using some of mimicMe’s built-in tools
described below.

3.1 Multiple sequence alignment

mimicMe offers the user the option of performing a MUSCLE
(http://www.drive5.com/muscle/) multiple sequence alignment
(MSA) between a host protein and all of its pathogen hits

(Fig. 1C). The alignment is colored based on sequence similarities
to the host protein, to highlight particular regions or motifs
mimicked by the pathogen/s.

3.2 Structural visualization

The conservation pattern from the MSA can also be mapped
onto a known PDB structure (http://www.pdb.org) of the host
protein, and visualized using GLmol (http://webglmol.source
forge.jp) (Fig. 1D). This may highlight particular regions of
structural mimicry.

3.3 Function enrichment

The user is also provided with the option to determine statistic-
ally enriched functions among the set of predicted mimicry tar-
gets (host proteins), which may reﬂect common host functions
targeted by the pathogen. Gene enrichment analysis is performed
using goatools (https://github.com/tanghaibao/goatools), with
Gene Ontology annotations retrieved from the EBI Gene
Ontology Annotation project (Camon et £11., 2004). In the ex-
ample described above, mimicMe returns GO:0016192 (“vesicle-
mediated transport”) as the top enriched function (P = 1.18e—5).
Indeed, manipulation of host vesicular trafﬁcking is a hallmark
of Legionella pathogenesis (Ge and Shao, 2011).

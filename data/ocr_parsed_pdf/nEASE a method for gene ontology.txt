ABSTRACT

Summary: High-throughput technologies can identify genes whose
expression profiles correlate with specific phenotypes; however,
placing these genes into a biological context remains challenging. To
help address this issue, we developed nested Expression Analysis
Systematic Explorer (nEASE). nEASE complements traditional
gene ontology enrichment approaches by determining statistically
enriched gene ontology subterms within a list of genes based on
co-annotation. Here, we overview an open-source software version
of the nEASE algorithm. nEASE can be used either stand-alone or
as part of a pathway discovery pipeline.

Availability: nEASE is implemented within the Multiple Experiment
Viewer software package available at http://www.tm4.org/mev.

Bioinformatics online.

1 INTRODUCTION

Numerous studies indicate that high-throughput measurement of
gene transcription provides the means to examine how organisms
respond on a genome-wide scale to experimental perturbations or
to the development of pathological conditions. Analysis of the data
produced by these technologies typically results in lists of genes
whose expression patterns correlate with the phenotypes under
study. However, placing these lists into a useful biological context
remains a signiﬁcant challenge.

A common approach to this problem is to perform statistical
assessment of categorical assignments of functional attributes
(Ashburner et al., 2000) associated with genes identiﬁed in
a particular analysis. Current functional enrichment algorithms
can be classiﬁed into three main classes: singular enrichment

analysis (SEA); gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA); and modular
enrichment analysis (MEA) (Huang da et al., 2009).

Traditional SEA approaches, such as EASE (Hosack et al.,
2003) and Onto-express (Draghici et al., 2003a, b; Khatri et al.,
2002, 2004), use a predeﬁned list of differentially expressed genes
to linearly assess the enrichment of individual gene ontology
(GO) terms (Ashburner et al., 2000) in a term-by-term fashion
with statistical methods that include chi-square, Fisher’s exact test
and Binomial probability. The GSEA class, on the other hand,
takes a ‘no-cutoff’ approach that utilizes expression data and
associated experimental values from all genes in a microarray
experiment to derive enrichment scores for annotation terms. In
the original GSEA method, gene members of each functional
category are rank ordered based on expression values to determine
a maximum term enrichment score; P-values are then assigned to
each term by a Kolmogorov—Smirnov-like statistic (Subramanian
et al., 2005). The more recent MEA class of algorithms use varied
statistical methods combined with network discovery approaches
that improve enrichment sensitivity and speciﬁcity by evaluating the
relationships among categorical assignments (i.e. parents, children,
siblings) (Alexa et al., 2006; Grossmann et al., 2007; Zhang et al.,
2010).

2 METHODS AND IMPLEMENTATION

The nEASE algorithm allows users to discover biological subclassiﬁcations
for biological process, molecular function and cellular component GO terms.
nEASE is a unique MEA method that combines SEA statistics with an
iterative discovery approach based on gene co-annotation. The algorithm
identiﬁes enriched, sublevel GO terms based on co-annotating genes from
adaptive gene tallies generated from statistically enriched EASE terms. That
is, the program ﬁrst runs EASE to identify enriched primary terms. Then
within each enriched primary term, a second nested EASE is run, restricted
to elements of the primary term, to see if there is interesting biological
functionality that distinguishes the expressed from the non-expressed genes
within the primary term. The algorithm performs a Fisher’s exact test
on each enriched EASE term with the primary GO term as background,
while controlling for familywise error rate as described in Supplementary
Material. Figure 1 provides an example from our Supplementary Material

analysis of the background distribution adjustment performed by the nEASE
algorithm.

In our Supplementary Material analysis, we applied nEASE to
large, publicly available human breast, lung, prostate and renal cancer
DNA microarray datasets. We uncovered differences among differentially
expressed gene lists relative to these human cancers not identiﬁed with the
standard SEA GO analysis. We also provide experimental support for the
usefulness of nEASE to generate unique working hypothesizes relative to a
given condition under study. While one should be careful of such post hoc
analysis, we believe it does add further evidence as to the expected utility of
our method. Thus, we ﬁnd that nEASE provides additional, complementary
biological information based on gene co-annotation of four human cancers
that would otherwise be overlooked by existing methods.

We have implemented an open-source version of nEASE within the
Multiple Experiment Viewer (MeV) software package. MeV is the main data
analysis and Visualization tool of the TM4 software suite (Saeed et al., 2006).
MeV consists of open-source tools for data management and reporting,
data normalization and pipeline control, and data mining and Visualization.

An integrated MIAME-compliant MySQL database is also included in the
package. Within the MeV data mining environment, users can load raw or
normalized data from a variety of input ﬁle types. A user-friendly, integrated
scripting interface and XML-based format allows users to access a broad
range of established high-throughput data analysis tools.

Further details of the nEASE algorithm are provided in Supplementary
Material. We also provide comprehensive MeV user support, including a
detailed tutorial describing how to use the nEASE algorithm, a Frequently
Asked Questions (FAQ) page and the MeV Sourceforge help forum at
http://www.tm4.org/meV/?q=support.

3 DSCUSSON

There are many GO classiﬁcation tools in the literature, including
but not limited to GOTermFinder (Boyle et al., 2004), GOMiner
(Zeeberg et al., 2003), Onto-express (Draghici et al., 2003a,
b; Khatri et al., 2002, 2004), Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
(GSEA) (Jiang and Gentleman, 2007; Subramanian et al., 2005),
FatiScan (Al-Shahrour et al., 2007), Ontologizer (Bauer et al.,
2008; Grossmann et al., 2007) and GO-Bayes (Zhang et al., 2010).
These tools provide the user with an effective means to biologically
interpret genomic data ﬁndings. While these methods take
different approaches to determining overrepresentation of functional
attributes, to our knowledge none considers the relationships among
GO terms based on gene co-annotation. To complement the existing
SEA methods, we developed nEASE. Conditioning on enriched
upper-level EASE terms dramatically reduces the dimensionality
of the search space, increasing the power to detect signiﬁcant GO
subterm enrichment. Unlike contemporary MEA algorithms, nEASE
evaluates the relationships among all categorical assignments of the
GO directed acyclic graph.

sparse network models, ITO/[i=1 | D) is reduced if there is an—
other regulator k with similar dynamics to j. In the case of an
exact identity between the dynamics of j and k, there are three
identical regression models: y”: l, ym =0; y,/=O, y,k=l and
y” = l, ym = l, and thus the probability of any one, and therefore
of n(y,~,= l | D) is reduced. The relative weighting of these three
states is determined by the prior link probability ,0, which is low
in sparse networks, thereby downweighting the double link case;
therefore, only the two states y,/=0, y,k=l and y”: l, y,k=0
need to be considered, effectively halving n(y,~/=1|D) relative
to the case when k is excluded from the network (proof in
Section 2.1.1). A key problem is gauging when regulators
might interfere, specifically how interference decreases with a
diminishing correlation between these regulators and thus decid—
ing how to select which regulators to use in the regression.
Failing to deal with this appropriately means that key regulators
might be missed because they are part of a correlated set of
regulators, and their link probabilities fall below threshold
through mutual interference. We developed a framework for
solving this problem based on the analysis of conditional poster—
ior link probabilities that identiﬁes the interfering sets of regula—
tors. This allowed us to deﬁne an interference—corrected causal
network and, further, the relative weights of the interfering regu—
lators reﬂecting their likely contribution to the control of a given
gene.

The article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we analyse the
impact of identical regulators on network links, demonstrating
that the link probabilities of identical strong regulators are es—
sentially additive. We give a numerical demonstration of the
theory on an augmented experimental dataset, doubling up a
key regulator. In Section 3, we develop a framework to correct
for interference in network construction, a post—processing step
that clusters regulators and calculates regulator interference
within clusters for each target. In Section 4, we illustrate our
method on three experimental datasets that give rise to networks
with distinct architectures and demonstrate that interference is
data specific, there being no simple relationship between inter—
ference and regulator correlation. Further, we provide evidence
that the recovered links are functional. In Section 5, we discuss
the impact of these issues and the generality to other inference/
f1tting methods.

2 THE REGULATOR INTERFERENCE PROBLEM

Causal network determination relies on causal signals leaving a
signature in the gene expression dynamics, essentially a correl—
ation between X’ H and X’ . However, if two (or more) regulators
have similar dynamics,  B  for all t, then the identity of the
regulator is unclear, the true regulator being either j, k or both.
This correlation in the data gives rise to an approximate sym—
metry for the likelihood, L(6; X’) B L(6; (12/,kX’), where (PM is
the exchange transformation j <—> k. Lifting the symmetry to the
space of model parameters gives rise to an approximate exchange
symmetry on the parameters 6, L(6; X’) B L(<I>;,k6; X’). In par—
ticular, identical data Xj=Xk means that the likelihood has an
invariance symmetry, and Bi,- and Bik are unidentif1able in the
linear network model (1). The lifted symmetry in this case reads
kB./=B.k,  =Bk., etc. In this section, we develop a
framework to analyse and detect interference between regulators

and demonstrate the impact of an exact symmetry (two identical
regulators) on real data.

2.1 Two identical regulators

2.1.1 Theoretical analysis of regulator interference Consider an
exact data symmetry (12/,kX’ = X’, i.e. XI, Xk are identical. The like—
lihood is then invariant under the lifted symmetry k. The prior is
also likely to satisfy this symmetry, i.e. the prior on 19,-,- is likely
identical to that of Bik. Thus, the posterior link probabilities satisfy
this symmetry, n(y,~/|D) =rr(y,~k ID) and similarly all joint condi—
tionals. However, the aspect of the symmetry we are interested in is
whether the following two models predict different networks.

Ml Only regulator j is considered in the set of regulators, i.e.
regulator k is removed from the network.
M2 Both regulators j, k are present in the network.

These are nested networks because M1 is M2 under the con—
straint ym = 0, i.e. the conditional posterior probability ITO/,7 = 1
ID, ym = 0) is the link probability on Ml, whereas that of M2 is
the posterior probability ITO/[i=1 ID), (no constraints), both of
which can be computed from the joint distribution ITO/,7, ym ID).

We proceed to determine an expression relating ITO/[i=1 |D,
ym =0) and ITO/,7 = 1 ID). Throughout we consider ,0 as fixed; in
practice, it has low posterior variance in the full network analysis
and so fixing ,0 equal to the posterior mean in the following is a
good approximation. Firstly, we have

2

 B”, 8%, y” = l, yik = l; 

using Bayes formula and assuming independent priors. Here ,0 is
the (ﬁxed) link prior probability and é= 6\{B,~,«, 8%, y”, yik}.

The data symmetry <I>jk between j, k implies that L(6, B,~,«=
a, Bik=b, y”; l, yik = l; D)=L(é,B[/=a+b, yii= l, yik=0; D).
With a Gaussian prior on B,~,«~N(0, 02) (variance 02), we note
that for an arbitrary function f,

“2 4, r2 1 IV: + Z2

and thus deduce that,

where we make explicit note of the prior variance 02 on B”, 8%
because the dimension reduction above has doubled the prior
variance. This implies that the symmetry <I>jk results in a direct
relationship between the regulator link probability j —> i when
one (Model M1) or both links (M2) are present up to changing
the Gaussian prior variance of 8,,- between Models M1 and M2;
the other strength coefﬁcients Bis, s 75 j retain the original prior.
Assuming a sufﬁciently weak prior, we thus obtain an approxi—
mate equality n(y,~/= l, ym = 1 ID) 8 ﬁrm/,7 = l, ym =0 l D).

Thus, interference by identical regulators in sparse networks
reduces link probabilities by the number of identical genes, the
network topology running randomly over the single regulator
networks because states with multiple links are severely down
weighted by ,0. The regulators thus share equally the causal
signal, and the true link probability of the causal dependence is
(approximately) given by the sum over the link probabilities of
these interfering regulators.

3 DETECTING NETWORK LINK INTERFERENCE

A continuity argument to the identical regulator case above, Section
2.1.1, suggests that we should expect interference to occur between
highly correlated regulators. However, the dependence of interference
(link suppression) on the degree of correlation between the regulators,
the expression levels of the regulators and their targets, is unknown. What
is clear is that correlated genes can interfere with each other, potentially
causing a signiﬁcant reduction in the posterior link probabilities of dy-
namically similar regulators by as much as a factor of n for n highly
correlated regulators. Therefore, causal networks deﬁned by application
of a simple threshold criterion, n(y,j : 1 |D)> ¢, are potentially erroneous
because interfering regulators may be lost since their posterior link prob-
abilities fall below the threshold ¢. Here we establish a method to con-
struct a network corrected for interference.

Our method is as follows. Given expression (time series) data D (re-
stricted to DE genes), and a subset R of potential regulators based on, for
example, functional annotation, deﬁne the interference-corrected network
(ICN) N(a), ¢) with correlation and link thresholds a), ¢ respectively, by

(l) Cluster the regulators R into correlated sets |Cjk| : m, using the
correlation coefficient (or other similarity index) C ff, deﬁning clus-
ters CR“'(w), s: 1, 2..., possibly singletons. We determine levels of
interference between regulators within each cluster, ignoring inter-
ference between regulators outside these sets. Singleton clusters are
regulators where interference from all other regulators is ignored.

(2) Infer the network posterior distribution and the conditional pos-
terior link distributions for regulators in the clusters (here we use
MCMC samples from GRENITS). Speciﬁcally, compute for each
j e CR“'(w) the conditionals 71(y,»j = 1 |D, yik = 0, Vk e CR“'(w)\{j})
for each target i.

(3) For a regulator j e CR“'(w) and a target i, a link j —> i in the net-
work N(w, ¢) exists if either of the following two conditions holds

a—link : 71(14): 1 |D, R) z ¢.
ﬁ—link : 71(14): 1 |D, R)<¢ and
710/1;- =1|D~me = (Wk 6 CR“'(w)\{1'}) 2 $-
For singletons, only the a-link condition is relevant. A further numerical
restriction is also applied to ﬁ-links; the sample size for calculating the

conditional probability should be 2100 in order that a 90% conﬁdence
interval can be computed; on smaller sample sizes, accuracy of this

estimate is poor. Small sample sizes can occur if there is a very strong
link in the cluster, then conditioning on that link to be off gives a small
number of samples. Acquiring a larger number of posterior samples
(running the sampler for longer) relaxes this limitation.

The a-links in N(w, ¢) are the original links in N(1, ¢) (uncorrected
network), i.e. the ICN comprises the original network augmented with
recovered ﬁ-links. We deﬁne the link probability for each link in the ICN
as the maximum of its posterior link probability and the links’ conditional
probability based on the regulator’s cluster at threshold a) (if applicable).

The number of ﬁ-links in the ICN increases on average as the correl-
ation threshold a) decreases for a ﬁxed link probability threshold ¢.
However, as the correlation threshold decreases, interference amongst
clustered regulators becomes weaker as regulators with decreased levels
of mutual interference are clustered together. Therefore, to ﬁnd a correl-
ation threshold where the partitioning of regulators into mutually inter-
fering sets is optimized, we use a scoring method that quantiﬁes levels of
interference. We propose a score where a ﬁ-link has a weight inversely
proportional to the number of regulators in its cluster CR“'(w), giving the
ﬁ-link network score

I(j —> i)

5““ ‘1’)   | Cwa) | (5)
where I(j —> i) is 1 if the ﬁ-link is present, otherwise 0. Then strong
interference among highly correlated regulators increase the score,
while weaker regulators (where only a proportion of the regulators in
the cluster have a conditional probability above threshold to a given
target) decrease the score. For instance, forming a new cluster (a) decreas-
ing) comprising two ﬁ-links adds 1 to the score. But adding a third regu-
lator to the cluster that does not regulate that target (conditional below
threshold) reduces the contribution to the score to 2/3. Typically ﬁ-links
are stable in that those present at a) are a subset of ﬁ-links for all w’ <w.
We maximize the network score 5(a), ¢) with respect to a), deﬁning the
optimal correlation threshold w*(¢) and associated optimal ICN. In cases
where there is a tie, we use the highest correlation that maximizes the
ﬁ-link network score because further clustering gives no evidence of an
increase in interference.

The link probability threshold ¢ is chosen based on the conﬁdence
required for assigning links (Morrissey et al., 2010, 2011); in practice, it
is lower than desirable because posterior link probabilities are typically
low (see Supplementary Fig. S4). We note that the value ¢=1/(2 — 0)
has a special signiﬁcance as regards interference analysis (the prior link
probability parameter p is ﬁxed at its posterior mean), as it is the highest
value of the conditional link probability for two identical regulators, see
Equation (4) with 71(14): 1 |D, yik = 0): 1. Thus, when ¢<1/(2 — 0),
some of the a-links are interfering with each other, as shown in
Figure 1. Hence, to correctly assess interference, the link threshold
should be greater than 1/ (2 — p). In Section 4, we consider the effect of
¢ on interference and its impact on w*(¢) on real datasets.

Finally, we note that different clustering methods are likely to give
slightly different results for the ICN, but identiﬁcation of interfering
regulators is likely similar.

4 DEMONSTRATIONS ON REAL DATA
NETWORKS

In this section, we analyse interference on three experimental
examples. Firstly, the full expression dataset for S.coelicolor
under phosphate depletion (Nieselt et al., 2010), a second experi—
mental dataset for S.coelicolor under glutamate depletion
(Waldvogel et al., 2011) and expression data for the
Arabidopsis circadian clock (Windram et al., 2012) (see Section
1 of Supplementary Material). In each case, we do not subselect
regulators based on their (dynamic) similarity but construct the

recovered ﬂ—links of 757 links in the ICN, i.e. regulator interfer—
ence caused a loss of 34% of links, 103 in the cdaR hub, inter—
fering primarily with redZ (SC05881), the principal regulator of
the undecylprodigiosin antibiotic gene cluster (with a correlation
of 0.95), and 125 in the phoURP hub, a result of cross—interfer—
ence between phoU, phoR and phoP (correlation coefﬁ—
cients >0.93) with 69, 32 and 24 ﬂ—links, respectively.

Interference to a common target is highly heterogeneous
across regulators within a cluster. For illustration, classify targets
for clustered regulators according to the type of links in the ICN,
ranging from sole Gt targets (one regulator is an Ot-lll’lk, other
regulators lack a link), mixed (ii/ﬂ targets (at least one 0t- and
ﬂ—link), partial 6 targets (at least one ﬂ—link but not all 0, and no
at) and complete 6 targets; these respective classiﬁcations have
increasing levels of mutual interference. The joint targets between
SCO3217 and SC05881 in ICN N(0.95,0.55) then show a diver-
sity of classes, with the absolute target—regulator (time shifted)
correlation predicting the target classiﬁcation (Supplementary
Fig. S9). Speciﬁcally, the sole Gt targets of SCO3217 have a
higher absolute correlation with SCO3217 than with SCO5881,
and vice versa, while complete 6 targets have closer correl—
ation coefﬁcients. The degree of mutual interference also shows
variation (Supplementary Fig. S10); the complete 6 targets are
evenly weighted with similar conditional link probabilities,
whereas the partial ﬂ—links have greater differences in their con—
ditional link probabilities. Results are similar for the optimal
ICN but more complex because of the three—way interfer—
ence between SCO3217, SC05881 and SCO4425. Interference
is thus heterogeneous within the target base of clustered
regulators.

To assess levels of accuracy of our recovered ﬂ—links, we exam—
ined the 24 targets predicted for PhoP [seven are in the same
operon as deﬁned by (Charaniya et al., 2007)]; in the uncorrected
network, phoP had no targets, whereas phoU and phoR had 19
and 69, respectively at ¢=0.55. It is highly likely that most of
these targets are actually regulated by PhoP, the principle regu—
lator of the phosphate response (Martin et al., 2012; Rodriguez—
Garcia et al., 2007). We examined two criteria, ﬁrstly, whether
these targets had distinctly different profiles under phoP knock
out (Thomas et al., 2012; Supplementary Figs S11 and S12), and
whether there was evidence of a PHO box upstream of the gene,
the binding site for PhoP (motif GTTCA). The first criteria
showed that five predicted targets were signiﬁcantly altered at
the 0.5% level (SC01196, SCO3899, SCO4726, SC05390,
SCO6753), and three others at 5% (Supplementary Table S3).
The second criteria indicated that five targets (SCO3899,
SCO4545, SCO4653, SCO4726, SCO6753) and the operon
(seven genes) have strong evidence of a PHO box or a dyad,
(Multiple EM (Expectation Maximization) for Motif
Elicitation (MEME) score >10, resp. 6); five genes were in
both categories (Supplementary Table S3). Close examination
of the transcriptional proﬁles shows that many have a discernible
difference in the dynamics across phosphate depletion; typically,
AphoP shows slower changes in gene expression. All those with a
PHO box show this behaviour. Thus, >50% of predicted targets
have supporting evidence of a PhoP binding site (Supplementary
Table S3). The two genes SCOl 196 and SC05390 underwent a
dramatic change in expression, but there was little evidence of the
presence of a PHO box. They may therefore be indirect targets or

possess functional but altered PHO boxes. Together, this pro—
vides strong evidence that correcting for interference is essential
because otherwise important targets may be missed. All of the
PhoP targets were lost in absence of an interference correction in
this case.

4.2 Example 2: glutamate depletion causal network

We examined the ICN for a second S.c0elic0[0r dataset under glu—
tamate depletion (Waldvogel et al., 2011), a treatment that also
gives rise to the synthesis of RED and ACT antibiotics. The data
comprises 945 DE genes including 59 predeﬁned DE regulators (see
Section 1 of Supplementary Material). The absolute correlation
between these regulators and the corresponding clustering tree
(Supplementary Fig. S7) are similar to those in the phosphate de—
pletion experiment (Supplementary Fig. S6). Under the same ana—
lysis as above, the optimal ICN occurred at a similar clustering
threshold, (¢=0.55, a)*(0.55)=0.859; Supplementary Figs S13
and S14) and comprises 283 links of which 35 are ﬂ—links, i.e.
there is a substantially lower level of regulator interference in this
dataset with an estimated loss of 12% by regulator interference.
Thus, despite similar correlations among the regulators and a simi—
lar posterior link probability distribution (Supplementary Fig. S4b)
to that in the phosphate depletion experiment, regulator interfer—
ence, although signiﬁcant at 35 ﬂ—links, was reduced. This may be
because of the different network structure; under phosphate deple—
tion the network comprises distinct separated large hubs, Fig. 3,
whereas under glutamate depletion the network is more dispersed
among a number of smaller hubs, Supplementary Fig. S14.

4.3 Example 3: Arabidopsis circadian clock network

The Arabidopsis circadian clock is one of the most well—
established biological networks containing both transcriptional
and translational regulation. We used transcriptome data com—
prising 10 regulators (Windram et al., 2012), every 2h up to 48 h,
24 time points in total. There are four biological replicates at each
time point allowing the replicate causal linear model with Student
noise in GRENITS to be used for network inference (Morrissey
et al., 2010). The absolute correlation between these regulators
and the corresponding clustering tree are shown in
Supplementary Fig. S8. The ICN N(a), (1)) was constructed follow—
ing the method in Section 3 (Fig. 4) and displayed similar trends
to the two previous larger networks (Fig. 2; Supplementary
Fig. S13). We constructed the optimal ICN for ¢=0.55
(Fig. 5); the lowest link threshold for a full interference assessment
is 1/(2 — ,0)=0.543 in this case (Supplementary Fig. S5).

To validate our method, we compared our reconstructed net—
work with the Arabidopsis circadian clock model in (Pokhilko
et al., 2013), deﬁning the ground truth network (Supplementary
Table S4). We inferred 12 links, which consist of 6 ai—links and 6
ﬂ—links (Fig. 5). In particular, all the ﬂ—links are correct, whereas
only three of the Ot-lll’lkS are correct. The precision of our ICN
prediction is thus 75%, subject to the degree to which the net—
work is actually known. Furthermore, an analysis of the ICNs
across link threshold (7) shows that the optimal ICN always has
maximal precision for link thresholds ¢= 0.55 and above
(Supplementary Fig. S15). Finally, a comparison between
NIACS and Murphy’s Bayes Net Toolbox (Murphy and Mian,

(Supplementary Table S5).

5 DISCUSSION

In this article, we have proposed a method for dealing with the
problem of regulators with similar dynamics suppressing causal
link signals in the auto—regression model Equation (1). By
analysis of the level of interference between highly correlated
regulators (computed from the posterior conditional link prob—
abilities), we are able to correct for link suppression by near
identical regulators, and thus recover regulator links that
would otherwise be lost because their posterior link probabilities
are reduced below threshold. We deﬁned an ICN N(a)*, (1)) that
includes as a subnetwork the original network N(1, 4)), i.e. our
method only adds links lost by interference. The ICN is defined
at the value of the correlation threshold (0* where interfering
regulators are judged to be optimally clustered as measured
by a score that sums over weighted ﬂ—links; our score punished
clustering of inconsistent regulators through a lack of mutual
interference or no interference.

Our approach avoids a subjective subselection of the set of
predeﬁned regulators, i.e. all regulators should be included in
the inference in absence of prior information, and, by a post—
processing step, interference is corrected. In effect, we are assum—
ing that there are potentially multiple regulators for a target, but
network inference is hampered by insufﬁcient dynamic data to
separate signals from (individual) regulators with similar dy—
namics. Determining whether there are two true regulators as
opposed to one is not possible without additional experimental
data, e.g. experiments under conditions where the regulators
have distinct dynamics or conducting experiments with strains
where either regulator is expressed under an inducible promotor.
Our method crucially prevents loss of both regulators from the

and ﬂ-links (magenta). Solid lines indicate predictions consistent with the
latest experimental data and model (Pokhilko et al., 2013), while the
dashed lines indicate predictions that are not thus far supported by cur-
rent literature. Arrows indicate activation and the T-arrows inhibition

inferred network. We demonstrated that the recovered ﬂ—links
for PhoP and the Arabidopsis circadian clock are functional,
with precision at least as good as that for the predicted ai—links.
In a comparison against other network inference methods on
simulated data (DREAM4), GRENITS is already highly com—
petitive, while performance is further improved when coupled
with NIACS to correct for regulator interference, the area
under precision recall curve increasing on average by 10%
(Supplementary Table S2). Most of the improvement is in the
crucial high conﬁdence predictions (Supplementary Fig. S3).
NIACS outperformed the other methods in 10 of 14 cases.

For the ICN N(a)*, 4)), we assign the link probability as the
maximum of the posterior link probability and the conditional
probability (if applicable). However, we do not expect the con—
ditional probability rr(y,-,-= 1 ID, yik =0, Vk e CR‘(a)*)\{j}) to
truly reflect the probability of regulator j regulating i, as this is
dependent on the clustering set CR‘(a)*). In essence, if there are
multiple regulators, they all affect the dynamics (if on), and a
true measure of their regulatory effects is in the presence of the
other regulators. Therefore, we recommend that ﬂ—links arising
from interference remain distinguished because their probabil—
ities are corrected and thus a direct comparison with ai—links
may be misleading. However, the relative weighting within a
cluster of regulators according to their conditional posterior
probabilities is a reflection of the evidence in the data as to the
identity of the true regulator. The identity of this true regulator
may also be discerned by using additional experiments or gene
annotations. These data can also be used as prior information in
GRENITS restricting allowable links, thereby removing some of
the regulator ambiguity.

Our analysis on three real datasets demonstrated that interfer—
ence is not simply a function of regulator correlation. In the phos—
phate depletion causal network (Example 1), for two highly
correlated regulators, we found a spread of interference among
their targets comprising a set of targets on which interference is
mutual, whereas other targets have only a sole regulator despite

their high correlation; interference is thus heterogeneous on the
set of targets. These observations mean that interference must be
analysed on a per experiment, per target basis and the optimal
correlation threshold determined in each case.

In addition to regulator interference, we also observed another
phenomenon in our networks, whereby two (or more) regulators
enhance the causal signals of each other; specifically, the regula—
tors have elevated posterior link probabilities in the presence
of each other. We deﬁne pairwise synergistic regulators j, k on
target i as regulators with rt(y,~/ = 1 ID), 7T(]/,~k = 1 ID) >¢, ITO/,7 =
1 ID, ym = 0), 7T(]/,~k = 1 ID, y” = 0) < (7) (this definition can be
easily generalized to the case of multiple regulators). Causal
signal synergy between regulators was rare, with 3, 3 and 1 syn—
ergistic regulators in Examples 1, 2 and 3, respectively
(Supplementary Table S6). We emphasize that neither interfer—
ence nor synergy between the causal signals implies that a
mechanistic interference/ synergy exists. Link suppression/
enhancement from interference/ synergy in our context arises
because of similarity (correlation) in the regulator dynamics.

Interference between dynamically similar regulators in causal net—
work inference is a general problem. It will occur in any statistical
hypothesis testing methodology for the model in Equation 1. For
instance, as the weights 8,,- in Equation 1 are suppressed under inter—
ference, and their variance increases under a lack of (a posteriori)
identiﬁability, any test for a non—zero coefﬁcient will be subject to
loss of highly correlated regulator links (see Section 4.2 of
Supplementary Material). In this article, we have provided a meth—
odology to recover missing (suppressed) links within a Bayesian
context through a post—processing of the network posterior samples.

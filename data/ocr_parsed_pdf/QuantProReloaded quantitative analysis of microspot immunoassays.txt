ABSTRACT

Summary: Protein microarrays are well-established as sensitive
tools for proteomics. Particularly, the microspot immunoassay (MIA)
platform enables a quantitative analysis of (phospho-) proteins in
complex solutions (e.g. cell lysates or blood plasma) and with low
consumption of samples and reagents. Despite numerous biological
and clinical applications of MlAs there is currently no user-friendly
open source data analysis software available with versatile options
for data analysis and data visualization. Here, we introduce the open
source software QuantProReloaded that is specifically designed for
the analysis of data from MIA experiments.

Availability and implementation: QuantProReloaded is written in
R and Java and is open for download under the BSB license at

1 INTRODUCTION

A robust experimental platform to assess the abundance and activity
of many proteins in parallel, in biological and clinical samples is a
prerequisite to obtain a better understanding of signaling networks.
Thus, a careful and systematic analysis of samples from healthy and
diseased patients promises to facilitate also the detection of new
biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis.

Microspot immunoassays (MIAs) (Korf et (11., 2008) can
determine the abundance as well as the activity of different proteins
and other analytes in parallel. The MIA technology is comparable
to the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) approach, but
is superior in terms of its lower sample and reagent consumption
and a vastly improved dynamic range (Korf et (11., 2008). Capture
antibodies that are speciﬁc for a particular analyte or post-
translational modiﬁcation (e.g. phosphorylation) are immobilized
on a solid surface subdivided into several sub-arrays (blocks).
Each block is incubated with a different biological sample so
that the immobilized antibodies capture their speciﬁc analytes. In
the detection step, suitable antibodies directed against a different
epitope of the respective target are utilized contributing to the high

speciﬁcity of this approach. Finally, antibodies labeled with near-
infrared ﬂuorescent dyes are used to visualize the abundance of
a particular detection antibody in each of the spots (Korf et (11.,
2008). In addition to the samples themselves, a predeﬁned number
of blocks is incubated with a serial dilution of standard analytes
of known concentration. These so-called ‘calibrators’ are used to
ﬁt a calibrator curve to estimate the target concentration in the
measurement samples.

Despite the great potential of the MIA technology, the analysis and
visualization of data is still a bottleneck because no comprehensive
software tool is available allowing statistical data analysis as well as
data visualization. ProMat (White et (11., 2006), a tool designed for
the analysis of ELISA microarrays, can in principal also be employed
for certain MIA applications; however, ProMat cannot handle time-
course data. We have previously published basic algorithms for the
analysis of MIA data (Korf et (11., 2008) and released a ﬁrst version of
QuantPro. However, this version was not implemented with a user-
friendly interface and the ﬁlnctions integrated in QuantPro were not
robust against outliers.

The new open source tool, QuantProReloaded, was written in
R and Java and tailored towards the statistical analysis of time-
resolved and non-time-resolved MIA data. QuantProReloaded is
based on the ideas of QuantPro, but was completely redesigned
to streamline the analysis workﬂow and to make it applicable
to a wide range of protein array designs. A new method was
implemented into QuantProReloaded to calculate how accurately the
analyte concentration of the calibrators can be determined using a
re-estimation approach. This helps to identify the valid concentration
range for a certain antibody pair. Besides that, this method allows
also to identify a suitable ﬁlnction for appropriate ﬁtting of the
calibrator curve and to detect experimental outliers.

2 METHODS

QuantProReloaded is an open source software consisting of functions written
in R and embedded into a intuitive and platform-independent user interface
written in Java. rJava/J RI (http://www.rforge.net/rJava/) is used in the middle
layer to enable the interaction between R and Java.

(calibrator or measurement) are required. In case time-course experiments
were performed this ﬁle should also list the individual time points as part of
the sample description. QuantProReloaded can read any kind of tab-delimited

and rename the ‘default.properties’ template ﬁle of the QuantProReloaded
software package to describe the new format. Two applications are provided
in QuantProReloaded: the accuracy analysis and the measurement analysis.

The accuracy analysis determines the accuracy of the calibration by cross-
Validation of the calibrator data points. Thus, 60% of the calibrator data points
of each concentration are used to ﬁt a calibrator curve and the remaining data
points are used to re-estimate the protein concentration. The overall accuracy
is one minus the normalized distance between the real protein concentration
and the estimated protein concentration. Thus, a result of ‘1’ indicates that
there is no difference between the real protein concentration and the estimated
protein concentration. Several robust linear and non-linear functions are
included as option to ﬁt a calibrator curve and other functions can easily
be integrated. The resulting accuracy plot Visualizes how accurately the
analyte concentration can be re-estimated using a certain algorithm to ﬁt
the calibrator curve. In addition, the calibrator curve displaying the single
calibrator data points is shown.

The measurement analysis is designed to estimate the target protein
concentration of the samples and can be used independently of the accuracy
analysis. A calibrator curve is calculated using all calibrator data points and
serves as basis for the calculation of the analyte concentration in each sample.
Spots can be excluded from the analysis by marking them in the image
analysis software (e.g. Spotﬁnder and GenePix) and setting the ‘Remove
marked spots” option to ‘Yes’. The measurement analysis produces two tables
as output, the ﬁrst one contains the estimated analyte concentrations for all
samples and the second one lists the median as well as the median absolute
deviation for all analyte concentrations of all technical and biological
replicates. Furthermore, a calibrator plot displaying the calibrator curve, the
calibrator data points, a conﬁdence interval as well as the data points of
measurement samples is generated as well. For further information about
the displayed conﬁdence intervals can be found in Supplementary Material.
In case of dynamic measurements, a time-course plot is returned to facilitate
a fast comparison between the median concentration levels of a particular
protein at different time points.

Data from the time-course example in Figure 1 result from dose-dependent
measurements of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. In particular, the human
breast cancer cell line (MCF7) was exposed to different concentrations
of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and the formation of phosphorylated
ERK was monitored. Six slides with 16 blocks were used to analyze the
measurements and scanned with an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System at a
resolution of 21 um at 700 nm. Spot signal intensities were quantiﬁed using
the GenePix Pro 5 software and the results were saved as .gpr ﬁles (see
Supplementary Material for further details on the protocol).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Accuracy analysis

After completing the slide-description ﬁle (see Supplementary
Material), QuantProReloaded was started and the accuracy analysis
was chosen. In principal, this analysis can be done only for a certain
antibody pair at a time, but additional result windows can be opened
to compare different antibody pairs. In the example, data are shown
for the phospho-ERK-speciﬁc antibody pair named ERK_CST9106.
We choose a ‘linear ﬁt’ to calculate the calibration curves. As we
noticed slide effects in this particular experiment, the software option
to analyze arrays separately was selected. To obtain accurate results,
the cross-validation repetitions were set to a high number (in this
case: 1000). Plots and tables generated by QuantProReloaded are
stored in a selected output directory and are displayed in a new
window. Calibrator plots for each of the slides show an estimated
calibrator. This particular option for data visualization enables the
user to identify unreliable spots or slides that have to be removed
from the ﬁnal analysis. The accuracy plot is available in a second
tab and shows how accurate the analyte concentration could be re-
estimated. As can be seen in Figure 1B, in this instance almost
all values are greater than 0.9 and, therefore, a linear correlation
between spot intensity and protein concentration was assumed.

3.2 Measurement analysis

To estimate the dynamics as well as dose-dependent effects of
phospho-ERK formation, a new ‘measurement analysis ’ was started.
The same antibody combination was selected as used for the
accuracy analysis as well as for the linear ﬁt. The output window
consists of two tabs (calibrator plot and time-series plot). The
calibrator plot was skipped because of the linear correlation
identiﬁed in 3.1 and the ‘time-series’ tab was selected (Fig. 1A).
To sum up, Figure l conﬁrms a positive correlation between EGF
concentration and phospho-ERK formation for the entire time
period. Furthermore, the phospho-ERK concentration reaches its
maximum after 8min for the two highest EGF concentrations
(1, 10 nM) compared to a peak at 12 min for the lowest, EGF
concentration (0.3 nM).

level edges, assign that vertex to the currently top-most level and recurse on
the graph with that vertex removed. We also look for vertices with no
outgoing between-level edges and assign them to the currently lowest
level. If in some step multiple vertices have no incoming or outgoing be-
tween-level edges, they are assigned the same level. It can happen that all
vertices have incoming and outgoing between-level edges. In this case, we
select the vertex with the highest differential between weighted incoming
between-level degree and weighted outgoing between-level degree.

In the second phase of gene network inference we retain within-level
edges and those edges that link adjacent levels and are directed down-
ward. The latter procedure eliminates violating edges. As a final step, we
remove redundant edges according to their definition above.

3 DATA AND EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

We assess the accuracy of Réd by applying our inference ap—
proach to the datasets of J onikas et a]. (2009) and Surma et a1.
(2013) and compare results to known or partially known net—
works. Experiments that use data from Jonikas et a]. closely

follow the setup by Battle et a]. and use the same datasets and
reference pathways.

3.1 Mutant phenotype data

J onikas et a]. (2009) measured unfolded protein response (UPR)
levels in single and double mutants to systematically characterize
functional interdependence of yeast genes with roles in endoplas—
mic reticulum (ER) folding. The dataset contains 444 genes that
caused high UPR reporter inductions. The interaction data in—
clude phenotypes of 42 240 distinct double mutants (matrix G)
corresponding to 43% of all possible double mutants. Jonikas
et al. also computed typical (i.e. expected) values of genetic
interactions for every double mutant (matrix H). They con—
sidered multiplicative neutrality function (Mani et al., 2008)
and computed it using reporter levels of pairs of single mutants,
modiﬁed by a Hill function to account for the saturation of the
reporter signal.

Surma et a]. (2013) considered 741 genes and observed the
growth phenotype (colony size) for all pairs of double mutants.
In total, after ﬁltering out unreliable measurements, their dataset
comprises 251383 double mutant fitness scores. We computed
single mutant scores by averaging across all scores of double
mutants that included mutations of the corresponding genes.
We considered multiplicative model to calculate the expected
fitness of a double mutant in the absence of a genetic interaction.

3.2 Gene pathways

We compare gene networks inferred by Réd to a number of
known or partially known cellular pathways that include genes
whose perturbations are measured by Jonikas et al.:

0 The N—linked glycosylation pathway consisting of 10 genes
whose true ordering is known (Helenius and Aebi, 2004),

o The ER—associated degradation (ERAD) pathway for which
many functional interdependencies between its member
genes are known,

0 Tail—anchored (TA) protein biogenesis machinery consisting
of TA proteins important for transmembrane trafﬁcking
and the recently discovered GET pathway (Bozkurt et al.,
2009; Schuldiner et al., 2008; Stefanovic and Hegde, 2007).

We also compare Réd’s networks to well—characterized cellular
pathways of phospholipid biosynthesis whose gene mutants are
measured by Surma et a]. and that include the following:

o The Kennedy pathway involved in the synthesis of phospha—
tidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine (PC), and

o The phosphatidylserine to PC conversion pathway.

3.3 Experimental setup

In the first part of the experiments, we use mutant phenotype
data to qualitatively evaluate the reconstruction of ﬁve gene
pathways from Section 3.2. In the second part of the experi—
ments, we evaluate the accuracy of gene ordering through
three different setups. In the first two setups, the data—inferred
gene ordering was compared with the known pathways. In the
third setup, we use cross—validation to estimate the accuracy of

of candidate networks of which the best—scored were shown to be
partially consistent with known gene interdependencies. In con—
trast, for each pathway, Réd inferred a single network that is
entirely consistent with known gene relationships.

4.4 Quantitative analysis of gene ordering

Table 2 reports the accuracies of gene ordering prediction ob—
tained by four different algorithms, Réd, APN and two simpli—
ﬁed variants of Réd. In comparison with APN, Réd performs
substantially better in predicting the edges of the KEGG path—
ways and slightly better in predicting the edges of the N—linked
glycosylation pathway (Supplementary Figs S1 and S2).

The poor performance of the simpliﬁed variants of Réd (RAW
and MF) indicates that Réd’s latent representation inferred from
the factorized model, the non—linear logistic map and gene—
dependent weighting are the essential components of Réd.
Without any of these, Réd would not be able to achieve the
resulting accuracy.

4.5 Prediction of alleviating genetic interactions

Given the training and separate test datasets, we predict whether
an interaction is alleviating (see Section 3.3). Table 3 shows that
Réd performs substantially better than APN (P<0.001). Réd
also outperforms standard two—factor matrix factorization
(MF) by a large margin, which is an indicator that transform—
ation via a logistic map is essential to the performance of our
algorithm. We compare these results with those obtained by GP
(Williams and Rasmussen, 1996) using squared exponential auto—
correlation model constructed from the genetic interaction pro—
ﬁles, and with the interactions predicted with the DK (Qi et al.,

2008). Réd achieves significantly higher accuracy than GP
(P< 0.01) and DK (P<0.001), although the difference with GP
is small and may be worthy of further study. Note that RAW, a
Réd variant without factorization, is not applicable for this ex—
periment, as it does not generalize across gene interaction scores.

We have observed that the probabilities of alleviating gene
pairs predicted by Réd are well correlated to the strength of
alleviating interactions (Spearman r= — 0.704. P <1 x 10400;
Supplementary Fig. S3). Réd scores gene pairs with stronger
alleviating effects (negative interaction values with greater mag—
nitude) higher than those that interact moderately.

5 CONCLUSION

Réd is a conceptually new approach for inference of gene net—
works from quantitative genetic interaction data. It implements a
probabilistic epistasis analysis and assembles pairwise relation—
ships into gene networks. In our experiments, Réd was able to
reconstruct several known and partially known pathways with
accuracy above that of the state—of—the—art approaches. Réd out—
performs APN, the state—of—the—art method by Battle et a].
(2010), both in accuracy and speed, with CPU runtime of only
a few minutes compared with APN’s 30 min for an inference of a
single full network in an ensemble of 500 networks. We also
show that Réd’s power of generalization comes from its two
key components, a factorized model with latent representation
of gene interactions and a gene—dependent logistic map of inter—
action scores.

Our evaluation in this article was computational and thus
limited to datasets for which several gene pathways or at least
partial gene orderings were available (Battle et al., 2010; Jonikas
et al., 2009). Réd can efﬁciently handle similar datasets as well as
much larger ones, such as that from the recent yeast experiments
by Costanzo et a]. (2010). These are also the datasets for which
we foresee future applications of Réd and which will require
subsequent verification of inferred networks in the wet lab.

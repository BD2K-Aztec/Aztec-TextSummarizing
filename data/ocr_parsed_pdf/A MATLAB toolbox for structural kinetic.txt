ABSTRACT

Summary: Structural kinetic modeling (SKM) enables the analysis of
dynamical properties of metabolic networks solely based on topo-
logical information and experimental data. Current SKM-based experi-
ments are hampered by the time-intensive process of assigning model
parameters and choosing appropriate sampling intervals for Monte-
Carlo experiments. We introduce a toolbox for the automatic and
efficient construction and evaluation of structural kinetic models
(SK models). Quantitative and qualitative analyses of network stability
properties are performed in an automated manner. We illustrate the
model building and analysis process in detailed example scripts that
provide toolbox implementations of previously published literature
models.

1 INTRODUCTION

Structural kinetic modeling (SKM) enables the analysis of dy-
namical features of metabolic systems in steady states, without
requiring the knowledge necessary for the construction of kinetic
models, such as kinetic parameters and reaction rates. Instead,
these properties are derived solely from topological information
and experimentally measurable steady state data. In doing so, the
SKM algorithm derives a ‘parameterized’ version of the system’s
Jacobian matrix, in which model parameters encode the partial
derivatives of the reaction rates around the steady state (Steuer
et al., 2006). Once the J acobian matrix is computed for a given
set of parameters, the evaluation of its eigenvalues indicates
whether the steady state is stable. Here, a simple normalization
step enables the restriction of the parameter values to predeﬁned
sampling intervals (e. g. [0, l] for classical enzyme kinetics). This
enables the combination of SKM with a Monte-Carlo approach
(Steuer et al., 2006) in which large numbers of SK models are
created using randomly sampled parameters. The resulting
Jacobian matrices can then be evaluated quantitatively (by
counting the proportions of stable and unstable models) or quali-
tatively (by analyzing the conditions that lead to such stability or
instability). Qualitative SKM analysis can be performed by pair-
wise comparisons of the model parameters leading to stable or
unstable states (Grimbs et al., 2007) or by machine learning

approaches that search for patterns in the parameter space
(Girbig et al., 2012).

The SKM experiments presented so far used customized algo-
rithms in which the SK models had been constructed manually
‘from scratch’ for each pathway (Grimbs et al., 2007; Steuer et al.,
2007, 2006; Reznik and Segre, 2010). While this might be sufﬁ-
cient for small systems like in the mentioned examples, the con-
struction of SK models for larger systems or even systems of
genomic scale is not feasible manually. However, its potential to
be applied to large-scale systems is a major advantage of SKM
compared with kinetic modeling. Because it does not rely on de-
tailed kinetic knowledge, it is well suited for the investigation of
large metabolic systems for which only limited or uncertain infor-
mation about the individual reaction mechanisms is available.

Here, we present a MATLAB toolbox that enables the auto-
mated construction and evaluation of SK models. Models can be
constructed from a minimal input consisting only of the stoichio-
metric matrix N, steady-state concentrations S0 and the steady
state ﬂuxes V0, with the experimental data being obtained from
metabolomics and isotope tracing experiments. Model param-
eters can be derived automatically based on the information in
N. The user can also assign additional model parameters
(for example to describe regulatory interactions) or manually
manipulate the suggested parameter positions and intervals.

We illustrate the model building and analysis process in ex-
ample scripts that demonstrate the construction of previously
published literature models (Girbig et al., 2012; Steuer et al.,
2006) using the toolbox.

2 FEATURES

The key functionalities of the toolbox can be summarized as
follows:

0 SK models can be constructed from a minimum required
input which consists only of N, S0 and v0.

0 Information about the model components and their stoi-
chiometries can be efﬁciently imported from SBML ﬁles.

0 The program is ﬂexible to modiﬁcations of the model par-
ameters. This can be achieved by either manually modifying
the automatically determined parameters or by building par-
ameter matrices ‘from scratch’.

o MATLAB functions for the quantitative and qualitative
analysis of the resulting models are provided.

The most labor-intensive step in the construction of SK
models for Monte-Carlo experiments consists of choosing the
model parameters’ network positions and assigning appropriate

Fig. 1. SK model building and evaluation using the SKM toolbox. Required input arguments are the stoichiometric matrix N, steady-state concentra-
tions S0 and the ﬂuxes v0. Model parameters are assigned according to the information in N. They can be manually adjusted (i.e. by adding allosteric
regulators) before starting the Monte-Carlo simulation. The resulting distributions of model parameters and eigenvalues for stable/unstable models are

displayed automatically.

sampling intervals. The sampling intervals depend on the type of
kinetic rate law assumed for the reactions. For example, the
interval [0, 1] serves for modeling enzymeisubstrate interactions
in enzymatic reactions while [—n, 0] models the impact of an
allosteric inhibitor with Hill coefﬁcient n.

Internally, the toolbox uses a MATLAB struct object to
store network positions of model parameters that describe dif-
ferent types of interactions. If not provided as an input argument
for the toolbox, the struct will be automatically created based
on the stoichiometric coefﬁcients in N. The toolbox also enables
the generation of a template struct for manual modiﬁcation
by the user (for example by including regulatory interactions)
prior to the start of the program.

After Monte-Carlo simulation, the eigenvalues of each
Jacobian matrix as well as an indicator of the stability of each
underlying model are returned. This information can be further
analyzed by additional toolbox functions, such as pairwise com-
parisons between stable and unstable models. It can also be con-
verted into input for the decision tree algorithms C4 . 5 or C5 . O
(Quinlan, 2012) or analyzed manually with respect to speciﬁc
questions posed by the user. For instance, the example script
for the simpliﬁed glycolysis model of Steuer et a]. (2006) demon-
strates how to reproduce the results in the original publication
with the toolbox. Using this system as an example, Figure 1
provides an overview of the model building and evaluation
process.

3 AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION

The SKM-toolbox was developed under MATLAB version 7.11
(release R2010b). The SBML import requires the freely available
LibSBML package (Bornstein et al., 2008).

4 SUMMARY

The proposed toolbox helps to overcome a major bottleneck of
SKM-experiments, namely, the time-intensive assignment of the
model parameters. Furthermore, it provides a unifying frame-
work for publishing and sharing SK models. With the increasing
availability of genome-scale reconstructions of metabolic net-
works as well as the fast progress in experimental methods mea-
suring concentrations and ﬂuxes in these networks, our toolbox
can assist in applying SKM to larger and more complex systems
than attempted so far.

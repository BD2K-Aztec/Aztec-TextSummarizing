Spatial relationships

 

functional role in the development of the retinal vasculature
(Metea and Newman, 2006). An apparent spatial correlation
between astrocytes and the blood vessels has been noted (Stone
and Dreher, 1987), but only observational evidence of such a
relationship has been provided. Strong evidence of astrocyte
spatial correlation with various vascular properties would lend
further support to additional hypotheses of astrocyte function,
such as the suspected role of astrocytes in vasodilation and
constriction (Kimelberg, 2010).

Attempts to quantify the correlation between vascular struc—
ture and the spatial placement of astrocytes will suffer from the
problems previously discussed. The vasculature is a large hetero—
geneous structure with speciﬁc arterial and venous delineations
(Dorrell and Friedlander, 2006; Gariano and Gardner, 2005)
that requires us to image the entire retina. In addition, while
astrocytes can be represented as points in Euclidean space, the
vasculature is a continuous structure and cannot be represented
as such. Hence, a quantiﬁcation method is needed that can map
these disparate and large data sources into a common space.

In this article, we describe a method to quantify the spatial
correlation between features of heterogeneous biological struc—
tures and Euclidean points in tissue, and apply it to the retina.
The proposed method is capable of capturing differences be—
tween the features of heterogeneous structures and spatial distri—
bution of points. The method implements a geodesic coordinate
system that is based on the vascular structure. The vasculature
and astrocytes are converted to this geodesic feature space such
that the position of astrocytes relative to the vasculature is pre—
served. Astrocyte distribution in the geodesic feature space is
then empirically compared with the vascular distribution. We
show that the distribution of astrocytes often spatially correlates
with changes in the vascular structure. Finally, we apply our
methodology to a set of injured retinas and demonstrate that
long—term detached retina do not deviate from the spatial
patterns observed on normal retinas.

Our methodology uses a geodesic feature space that is inde—
pendent of Euclidean space: the scale of the images and rotation
of the retina about the optic nerve have no impact on the results.
The scale and rotation invariance facilitates comparison between
retinas and different cell types. For example, retinal neurons,
pericytes or Muller cells can be converted into this same feature
space for comparative analysis. In addition, this methodology
can be used on spatial studies between other structures and
cells, such as the relationship between neuronal networks and
supporting cells. Our results demonstrate that we can successfully
quantify the spatial correlation between these disparate biolo—
gical entities, and provide a foundation for future research
aimed at studying the spatial distribution of various biological
components in large tissue images.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

The goal of our method is to determine if astrocyte distribution in the
retina correlates with changes in vascular structure. For instance, as some
feature of the vascular structure becomes more frequent, we want to
determine if astrocyte distribution increases in close proximity to the
feature. To accomplish this, we extract astrocyte and blood vessel data
from large image mosaics of the retinal NFL. We then convert this retinal
data into a geodesic feature space that is based on the structure of the

vasculature, preserving the relative spatial relationship between astrocytes
and the vasculature. Histograms are then created for vascular and astro-
cyte data in the geodesic space. Finally, a distance is computed between
the vascular and astrocyte histograms, and bootstrapping is performed to
determine the correlation between the vascular structure and astrocyte
spatial distribution. We now detail each part of our spatial quantiﬁcation
method.

2.1 Images and data

2.1.] Image acquisition Our method is designed to quantify the spa-
tial relationship between large biological structures and point data such as
cellular locations. Hence, we acquired images of the entire retinal NFL,
which allows us to capture the complete retinal vasculature and all astro-
cytes present in the retina.

Images of mouse retinal NFL were viewed and collected on a laser
scanning confocal microscope using an automated stage to capture
optical sections at 0.5 pm intervals in the z-axis and pixel resolution of
1024 X 1024 in the xiy direction, with 20% overlap in the xiy plane.
Approximately 35(P400 3D images were acquired per retina, which
were then used to create maximum-intensity projections. The resulting
projections were then stitched together to create a single mosaic on the
order of ~17 500 pixels by ~17 500 pixels (\sim54002nm2).

A total of nine mosaics were created for this study, four normal and
ﬁve detached. The normal retinas are denoted as N 1, N2, N3 and N4.
Three 1 month detached retinas, a 2 month detached retina and a
4 month detached retina are denoted as D1, DlA, DlB, D2 and D4,
respectively. All retinas were stained with anti-GFAP and anti-collagen
IV. Astrocytes express glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP), outlining the
cytoskeleton of each astrocyte in the retina. The retinal vasculature was
captured by examining the anti-collagen IV labeling.

An example mosaic is shown in Figure 1A. The retinal vasculature is
clearly visible as the tree-like structures in the images. Individual astro-
cytes are visible as small star-shaped cells and can be seen in detail in
Figure 1B. Color images of astrocytes in Figure 1B can be found in the
Supplementary Material, in addition to further details on the tissue prep-
aration and the image-acquisition process.

2.1.2 Data extraction Each retina contains ﬁve or six arteries and
veins arranged in an alternating pattern around the optic nerve head. The
veins are easily identiﬁed on the images by their ‘conveying’ type
branching (Ganesan et al., 2010). As explained in the Supplementary
Material, the images are slightly modiﬁed so that there exists only one
path from any point on the vasculature to the optic nerve head, thus
enforcing a tree structure on each artery and vein. The vascular network
in each retina is traced using Neuronstudio (Rodriguez et al., 2008), an
automated tracing tool for network structures. The trace is discretized
into 2 pm segments of vasculature, and the tree structure of each of the
veins and arteries is recorded. That is, the parent and ancestor of each
2 pm segment are recorded.

Anti-GFAP staining of the retinal tissue labels the cytoskeleton of all
astrocytes in the retina. As the nucleus of the cell often contained the
highest concentration of GFAP, the presumed center of each cell is manu-
ally selected from the image, and the xiy coordinates recorded. There are
~3500—4000 astrocytes in each image.

2.2 Geodesic feature space

The core of our method is the transformation of all retinal data to a 2D
geodesic feature space that is based on the structure of the vasculature. The
ﬁrst dimension measures the distance from a location in the retina to the
optic nerve head through the vasculature (i.e. geodesic distance on a blood
vessel). The second dimension represents physical blood vessel width.
This vascular centric feature space is central to our quantiﬁcation
methodology because it allows us to express the physical area and

where E = (C[.X — Vj[k].x, 6,». y — Vj[k]. y), the difference in Euclidean co-
ordinates of astrocyte c,- and vessel segment Vj[k]. Note that  may be
composed of a combination of vein and artery segments; only the vein
notation was used in Equation (1) for explanation purposes. Essentially,
an astrocyte is converted into the geodesic feature space by assigning it a
vector of the geodesic distance and width of the Sm, nearest vascular
segments to the cell. Note we also record the origin of the sampled
artery/vein segments.

matrix 2, applying a weight proportional to the distance between
the sample and the astrocyte. Vascular segments in close proximity to
astrocytes are given more importance over distant blood vessel segments.
After a feature vector is constructed for an astrocyte, the weights
the spatial samples in  are normalized to sum to one. That is,

Cilkl-p = tilde/(2,723 Gil/117)-

2.3 Quantifying spatial relationships

2.3.] Histograms We compose the vascular and astrocyte feature
vectors into histograms so that we can compare the spatial distribution
of astrocytes relative with the vasculature. One major advantage of our
method is the ability to explore astrocyte distribution at different vascular
scales. Three different levels of histograms are implemented: retinal, ar-
terial/venous and individual blood vessels. We compose astrocyte histo-
grams at the same resolution as the vasculature histograms so that we can
test astrocyte spatial distribution at different granularities.

Construction of a histogram for a vein V,- and its accompanying astro-
cyte histogram is the same for any other individual artery/vein histogram.
A vein histogram is denoted as M, and the accompanying astrocyte
histogram as AM, where V,» = (B, N) and AV,» 2 (B, il/I). B is a
common set of bins in the geodesic space, and N and M are the counts
for the respective histogram bins.

The construction of V,» is simple. The count N) for some bin B) is
computed as

where

where C is the set of all astrocytes, and

1Lr(cz[k],B.,i) =   Czlkl-W) 6 Bi A Czlkl-n = i

In other words, the astrocyte histogram AV,» is the weighted count of all
astrocytes that contain a spatial sample from vein V,-.

To construct higher level histograms, histograms from the lower levels
are combined. For example, the venous histogram V =  M», where k
is the number of veins, and the top-level vascular histogram is simply
V U A (similarly for astrocyte histograms).

The bin set B is set so that each Bf covers a 0.1 X 0.1 region (recall
that the distance and width are normalized by the mean and variance).
The histogram counts are also normalized to sum to one to enable direct
comparison of histograms between retinas.

2.3 .2 Histogram distance We quantify the spatial relationship
between astrocytes and the vasculature by computing the probability
that an astrocyte histogram is a random sample from the corresponding
vascular histogram. Because the astrocyte histograms are constructed
by spatially sampling the vasculature, we hypothesize that the two histo-
grams should be similar if astrocyte distribution is highly correlated with
the structure of the vasculature.

A statistical test of probability distribution similarity is used, using the
Mallows distance (Munk and Czado, 1998). For two distributions X and
Y, the test statistic is

F(X, Y) = ﬁlMOfn, Y) - M(X, Y)}

where X ,, is an empirical sample of size n from X. Note that our histograms
are normalized to sum to one, equivalent to a probability distribution.

M(-) is the Mallows distance between probability distributions. The
Mallows distance has several desirable statistical properties (Bickel and
Freedman, 1981; Mallows, 1972). It is convergent up to the [m moment,
as well as convergent in distribution. These properties ensure that differ-
ences in distribution between astrocyte and vascular histograms are
accurately captured. Additional details on the Mallows distance can be
found in the Supplementary Material.

Bootstrapping is performed to compute a prior distribution of the test
statistic F for a given vascular histogram (Shao and Tu, 1995). A vascular
histogram is re-sampled multiple times, and the prior distribution of the
test statistic is computed using the re-sampled data. The hypothesis that
astrocyte distribution is correlated with a vascular histogram is unlikely
to be correct if the test statistic between an astrocyte and vascular histo-
gram is low compared with the re-sampled histograms.

Distance and width values are uniformly sampled from the blood
vessel histogram under test (e.g. M), and a sample histogram is con-
structed. The number of samples used is equal to the number of astro-
cytes that have a spatial sample from V,-. For some astrocyte  that has a
spatial sample from V,- (i.e. cj[k].n = i), sample j contributes to the sample
histogram the total weight of  in V,-. That is, for each sample j,
Z). cj[/(].p, ch[k].n = i, is added to the sample histogram (into the appro-
priate bin).

Note that the method of signiﬁcance testing does not depend on
the number of retinal mosaics that are collected. The bootstrapping
procedure provides a statistically sound method to compare two histo-
grams and is only used to determine if an astrocyte histogram is a ran-
dom sample from a vascular histogram. Hence even with a single retina,
the signiﬁcance testing procedure still provides accurate and statistically
valid hypothesis testing of the astrocyte histograms. Extrapolating the
results to a general population does, of course, require more than a
single retina.

3 RESULTS

The Mallows distance quantiﬁcation method was performed
on the three histogram scenarios for the nine retinas. In addition,
the method was also tested on synthetic retinal data to demon—
strate its effectiveness at capturing the spatial correlation
between vascular structure and astrocyte distribution. 2 is ini—
tially set to be 80 Mm, which is approximately the width of an
average retinal astrocyte. Sm is varied from 1 to 40. Each boot—
strapping test used 500 random samples from a histogram.
Exploration of the effect of 2 on the statistical testing can be
found in the Supplementary Material.

biological tissues exhibit similar structure and relationships to
those encountered in the retina. Our feature space and quantiﬁ—
cation methodology can be used to study spatial relationships in
these domains as well.

For instance, connectomes of neurons and glial cells (LoTurco,
2000; Anderson et al., 2011) contain large continuous structures
similar to the vasculature and are often spatially correlated with
other cells or entities (Leergaard et al., 2012; Sporns, 2011). The
geodesic feature space can be adapted for neuronal axons or cir—
cuitry; a common physiological or anatomical reference point can
be used in lieu of the optic nerve (e. g. cell soma), along with axonal
width or any other spatially correlated structural feature. The
locations of other nearby cells can then be converted into this
geodesic space (now based on neurons), and the spatial correl—
ation between cells and neuronal structure can be quantified in a
similar manner to astrocytes and the vasculature.

There have also been efforts to quantify the structure of neu—
rons using methods similar to our proposed method. These
methods attempt to characterize the morphology of neuronal
structures using topological features, such as diameter, path
length or branching factors (Brown et al., 2008; Cuntz et al.,
2007; Vonhoff and Duch, 2010). While these approaches are
not speciﬁcally designed to measure spatial correlation, they
can be incorporated into our method as an additional histogram
dimension. For instance, Sholl analysis (Sholl, 1953) could be
used in conjunction with soma distance and dendrite width to
measure spatial correlation between neurons and other biological
features using our method.

Finally, our methodology will provide further insight into the
biological processes in the retina. Spatial correlation can be stu—
died using our method in new experimental conditions, such as
development or disease. These additional spatial studies of
retinal conditions, as well as spatial studies on tissues with similar
structure, are promising avenues of future research efforts.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: To assess whether two proteins will interact under phy-
siological conditions, information on the interaction free energy is
needed. Statistical learning techniques and docking methods for pre-
dicting protein—protein interactions cannot quantitatively estimate
binding free energies. Full atomistic molecular simulation methods
do have this potential, but are completely unfeasible for large-scale
applications in terms of computational cost required. Here we inves-
tigate whether applying coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics
simulations is a viable alternative for complexes of known structure.
Results: We calculate the free energy barrier with respect to the
bound state based on molecular dynamics simulations using both a
full atomistic and a CG force field for the TCR—pMHC complex and the
MP1—p14 scaffolding complex. We find that the free energy barriers
from the CG simulations are of similar accuracy as those from the full
atomistic ones, while achieving a speedup of >500-fold. We also ob-
sen/e that extensive sampling is extremely important to obtain accur-
ate free energy barriers, which is only within reach for the CG models.
Finally, we show that the CG model preserves biological relevance of
the interactions: (i) we observe a strong correlation between evolution-
ary likelihood of mutations and the impact on the free energy barrier
with respect to the bound state; and (ii) we confirm the dominant role
of the interface core in these interactions. Therefore, our results sug-
gest that CG molecular simulations can realistically be used for the
accurate prediction of protein—protein interaction strength.

1 INTRODUCTION

Proteiniprotein interactions (PPI) are at the heart of all pro-
cesses in life. To understand living systems beyond the genome,
comprehensive knowledge of PPI is therefore essential.
Experimental techniques (Ezkurdia et al., 2009; Kastritis and
Bonvin, 2010; Sprinzak et al., 2003), prediction from sequence
(Ezkurdia et al., 2009) and proteiniprotein docking methods
(Kastritis and Bonvin, 2010; Pons et al., 2010) all have their
speciﬁc limitations. To assess the likelihood of two proteins inter-
acting under physiological interactions, we need to know both
the concentrations and the dissociation constant (or binding free
energy) of the proteins involved. Although it seems that the iden-
tiﬁcation of the interface region is rather successful (Lensink and
Wodak, 2010; Ofran and Rest, 2007), major open challenges are
the accurate determination of interaction strength (Kastritis and
Bonvin, 2010; Pons et al., 2010; Schueler-Furman et al., 2005),
the incorporation of protein ﬂexibility (Schueler-Furman et al.,
2005; Tobi, 2010; Wollacott et al., 2007) and accounting for
water and small solute entropic effects (Oshima et al., 2011;
Schueler-Furman et al., 2005). Most importantly, Kastritis and
Bonvin (2010) show that there is a poor correlation between
binding afﬁnity and scores for all nine commonly used docking
algorithms they tested on 81 complexes with known binding
afﬁnity.

Molecular simulations using atomic pairwise interaction po-
tentials are much more accurate for estimating interaction
strength than docking scoring functions, though computationally
much more expensive (Kastritis and Bonvin, 2010; Tuncbag
et al., 2009). Nevertheless, an immediate bonus of molecular
simulation is that it addresses all three challenges mentioned
above: interaction strength, ﬂexibility and entropic effects. For
biomolecular simulation in general, the solvent (water) is the
major obstacle to improve computational efﬁciency due to the
large number of water molecules needed to solvate the protein.
Many possible approaches to overcome this problem exist (for
recent reviews, see Dror et al., 2012; Fennell and Dill, 2011).
Among the fastest available are the mean-ﬁeld or ‘implicit solv-
ent’ methods; however, one of the main drawbacks is the lack of
accurate estimation of the solute entropy, especially in combin-
ation with charged solutes (Homeyer and Gohlke, 2012). By
lumping together small molecules (e.g. water molecules) or

CG vs. atomistic: realistic protein interaction energies

 

molecular segments into ‘meta particles’, coarse-grained (CG)
force fields retain the explicit description of the system, including
the solvent. Several CG models for water are available, each with
their particular strengths and weaknesses (Hadley and McCabe,
2012). Compared with atomistic force ﬁelds, CG models provide
increased computational efﬁciency at sufﬁcient levels of accuracy
(Tuffery and Derreumaux, 2012). Therefore, for the calculation
of molecular interactions, thermodynamic integration based on
atomistic simulations with explicit water is both theoretically well
founded and the most accurate solution available to date
(W ereszczynski and McCamrnon, 2012, Zhang et al., 2013).

In this work, we investigate the option of addressing the high
computational cost of atomistic molecular simulations by the use
of a CG force ﬁeld for such simulations. For this, we will use the
MARTINI CG protein force field for molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations (Marrink et al., 2007; Monticelli et al., 2008). This
force ﬁeld was developed for CG simulations of biological mem-
braneiprotein systems and has recently been used to simulate the
spontaneous association of GPCR proteins in a lipid bilayer
(Periole et al., 2012). The MARTINI force ﬁeld does not capture
structural rearrangements, such as changes in secondary struc-
ture. We will assess its applicability and accuracy for the calcu-
lation of interaction strengths for a pair of protein structures in a
water environment from constraint-force proﬁles.

By applying the MARTINI CG force field, we ﬁrst show that
we are able to estimate the free energy barrier with respect to the
bound state (AG0ff) with similar accuracy compared with atom-
istic force field calculations and in good agreement with experi-
mental data, but at >500—fold increased computational speed. For
this we selected two test cases: a TCRipMHC and an MPlipl4
scaffolding complex, both of which were previously studied with
atomistic models (Cuendet and Michielin, 2008; Cui et al., 2008,
respectively). We then show that calculated contributions of sur-
face residues to the interaction strength are sensitive to changes in
the amino acid residues involved. Random mutations at the inter-
face core yield major changes in calculated interaction strengths,
whereas mutations at the partially solvated interface rim yield
only minor changes. Random mutations at the rest of the surface
on average hardly affect the interaction strength at all. Moreover,
we ﬁnd that the evolutionarily most likely mutations, as assessed
by standard residue exchange propensities, at the interface core
also have a negligible inﬂuence on the interaction strength,
whereas evolutionarily unlikely mutations disrupt favourable
PPI considerably. This behaviour with respect to mutations is
consistent with what we would expect from a biological point of
View. Finally, we discuss future implications of our finding that
the major contributions to the interaction strength within our CG
approach arise from the interface core.

2 METHODS

2.1 Software and force ﬁelds

The mutate_model script in Modeller (Sali and Blundell, 1993) was
used to produce mutant structures. DSSP (Kabsch and Sander, 1983) and
JOY (Mizuguchi et al., 1998) were used to calculate the absolute and
relative solvent accessibility of residues, respectively. VMD (Humphrey
et al., 1996) was used to visualize the structures.

We used GROMACS 4.0.5 (Hess et al., 2008) for all MD simulations.
Atomistic simulations were performed using the GROMOS G43a1 force

ﬁeld using the default time step (At = 1 fs) (van Gunsteren et al., 1996).
CG simulations were performed using the MARTINI force field with the
default time step (At = 20 fs) (Marrink et al., 2007). Coarse-graining
(CG-ing) was performed as previously described for the MARTINI
model (Monticelli et al., 2008). All 20 amino acids were mapped into
four different bead types with respect to their physicochemical properties
(Supplementary Fig. S1). The non-bonded interactions between the CG
solvent and solute particles were modelled by truncated and shifted
LennardiJones pair-potential with a cut-off radius of 1.2 nm (Marrink
et al., 2007; Monticelli et al., 2008).

2.2 The potential of mean force

We use the potential of mean force (PMF) to describe the interaction
strength between two structures (Trzesniak et al., 2007). The centre of
mass (COM) separation r was chosen as the reaction coordinate along
which the mean force is measured. Integration of the mean force along
this pathway results in a free energy proﬁle (strictly, the PMF is not a free
energy proﬁle, as it does not correct for standard conditions; this is
covered in the Supplementary Information) that can be used to derive
the free energy barrier with respect to the bound state AG“. We ﬁrst
calculate the force me as a function of the reaction coordinate from
constrained MD simulations,
chan(r) = _<Fpull(r))NpT=  _ FA) ‘ yu)NPT 
where (Fpuu(r)) denotes the average force required to keep the interaction
members at the constraint distance r, F A and F3 the total forces acting on
the ﬁrst and the second interaction members, which arise from direct
interactions and interactions with explicitly simulated solvent, 7,, = 7/r
the unit vector connecting the two centres of mass and angular brackets
(> > >)NPT an average in the isothermaliisobaric ensemble.
We deﬁne the constraint distance r as
r = erOM,A — rc0M,Bl2‘-11d r E {r1,r2,---,r1v} (2)
where rCOM,i is the COM position of interaction member 1' and N is the
number of separation distances at which the chan values are calculated.
Three arbitrary separations are illustrated in Figure 1C for MP17p14.
We calculated the me at 50 distances for the TCRipMHC (where
Snm 5 r 5 7.45 nm) and at 54 distances for MP17p14 (2.16nm 5
r 5 4.44 nm). In cases where we simulated nearly identical starting con-
formations of a particular structure for better sampling at distance r, we
included these chan values into the average of me(r). After generating
the force proﬁle chan(r) for the range of separations, we calculated the
PMF by numerically integrating the interpolated chan(r) as

PMF(r) = — A, dr’ano’) (3)

From this proﬁle, the free energy barrier AG"ff is obtained from the
difference between the minimum of PMF(r) at rmin and the maximum
PMF value at larger distances r>rmin:

—AG°“ = min[PMF(r)l — maxiPMF(r > mm} (4)

Errors in the forces are estimated from the standard deviations of the
forces apmm (r) across the set of replicate simulations at each distance r,
and errors in the PMF apMF(r) are subsequently derived as follows:

0
mm) = f dr’ormo') (5)

2.3 Simulation setup

The wild-type (WT) X-ray structures of the TCRipMHC (Garboczi
et al., 1996) and MP17p14 (Kurzbauer et al., 2004) complexes, resolved
at 2.6 and 1.9 A, were taken from the Protein Data Bank entries lao7
and lvet, respectively. The TCRipMHC structure contains 707

shallow interface.

2.3.] Equilibration procedure

For the atomistic and CG simulations, a general equilibration scheme
was performed, which was identical for atomistic and CG except where
noted below. First, the structure was energy-minimized in vacuum, fol-
lowed by the separation of the interacting proteins to the constraint dis-
tance r along the reaction coordinate. These structures, for each r, were
solvated in a periodic cubic box with a size ensuring a minimum distance
between the proteins and the box edges to avoid self-interactions with
periodic images. For the atomistic simulations, the SPC water model and
a minimum distance of 1.2nm were used. For the CG simulations,
MARTINI water was used with a 1.0 nm minimum distance. Energy
minimization on the solvated system was performed ﬁrst with, and
then without, position restraints. In the atomistic energy minimization,
position restraints were ﬁrst put on non-H atoms, followed by restraining
only C, atoms. The system was neutralized by adding as many NaJr or
Cl’ counter ions as needed for a total charge of 0. Then, another unre-
strained energy minimization was performed. The neutralized and sol-
vated structure was simulated for 20 ps (atomistic) or 30 ps (CG) with
position restraints on the Cu atoms (atomistic) or whole structure (CG),
to allow the solvent to equilibrate around the solute. The temperature
was set to T = 303 K using a Berendsen (Berendsen et al., 1984) (CG)
or a Nose'iHoover (Cheng and Merz, 1996) (atomistic) thermostat with
‘ET 2 0.1 ps. The pressure in atomistic simulations was set to P = 1 bar

using a Parrinellchahman barostat (1981) with IP = 0.5ps. In CG
simulations, pressure was set to P = 300 bar, using a Berendsen barostat
(Berendsen et al., 1984) with IP = 0.5 ps. The high pressure in the CG
simulations was applied to ensure the bulk MARTINI CG water is in the
ﬂuid region of the phase diagram. We determined the MARTINI CG
water phase diagram from separate Gibbs ensemble simulations (Frenkel
and Smit, 2002). Temperature and pressure were equilibrated for 0.1 ns
(atomistic) or 0.2 ns (CG). The resulting conformations were used in the
production simulations without position restraints.

2.3.2 Atomistic production simulations Atomistic production MD
simulations were performed for the WT TCRipMHC (3 replicates) and
MP17p14 (10 replicates). Equilibration procedure and production runs
were repeated for each distance, cf. Equation (2). Each production simu-
lation was run for 2ns.

2.3.3 CG production simulations CG production MD simulations
were performed for the WTs and in-silico mutants (20 replicates). Before
starting the CG equilibration procedure, the atomistic structure was ﬁrst
energy minimized and then coarse-grained using atochg (http://md.
chem.rug.nl/cgmartini). The tertiary structure of the CG complex was
stabilized by generating distance restraints on the backbone atoms
(Marrink et al., 2007). This equilibration procedure and the production
runs were repeated for each distance in Equation (2). Production simu-
lations were run for 2ns or 2 us as indicated.

2.4 Deﬁnition of different residue classes

The relative and absolute solvent accessible surface areas (SASAs) of
the residues were calculated in the monomer (e.g. TCR) and dimer

forms (e. g. TCRipMHC). Subsequently, residues that have < 7% of their
side chain accessible to the solvent in both forms were deﬁned as protein
core. Residues that have >7% of their side chain exposed to the solvent in
the monomer and <7% in the dimer were deﬁned as interface core.
Residues that have >7% of their side chain accessible to the solvent in
both forms were deﬁned as interface rim if there was a difference of at
least 1A2 in their absolute SASA between two forms. Residues that do
not fall into one of the above groups were called surface residues. The
outer interface rim class is composed of the closest surface residue neigh-
bours of interface rim residues located on the same monomer. The
number of outer rim residues identiﬁed in a complex is the same as the
number of rim residues.

2.5 In silica mutations and statistical analysis

To probe the biological relevance of the CG calculations, we introduce
mutations guided by the BLOSUM62 substitution matrix (Henikoff and
Henikoff, 1992) in the MP17p14 complex. We mutated all 23 interface
core residues to the amino acid with the highest substitution score (other
than itself) to obtain the evolutionarily most likely mutant (see
Supplementary Table S6). In a separate set of mutations, we mutated
the interface core to the lowest-scoring substitutions to obtain the least
likely mutant (see Supplementary Table S6). We performed 20 replicate
simulations for both mutants, each starting from slightly different starting
conformations. Next, we also made all 23 x 19 possible interface core
mutants and simulated each 10 times.

To further probe biological relevance, we compare the effects of
random mutations at different locations at and around the interface for
both the MP17p14 and the TCRipMHC complexes. We created 20 com-
positionally different interface core mutants where all n interface core
residues (see Supplementary Table S2) were substituted with randomly
chosen amino acids. Then, we created 20 different interface rim mutants
by randomly substituting n interface rim residues with random amino
acids. Next, we obtain 20 outer interface rim mutants by randomly sub-
stituting the n non-interface neighbours of the interface rim. We calcu-
lated the PPI for each of these mutants only once rather than multiple
replicates. Differences in the free energy barrier AAG were statistically
tested with a two-sided Mann7Whitney test separately for every mutant
and for the WT.

Finally, we made speciﬁc interface mutations in a homologue of the
TCRipMHC complex described by Wu et al. (2002). We chose the seven
mutants with the largest measured AAGs: in the beta chain Q64A, E69A
and A73G, and in the peptide K99R, T102N, T102S and the double
mutant Y97F/T102S.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Calculation of free energy barrier with respect to
the bound state

To obtain the free energy barriers to compare atomistic and CG
results, we calculate the PMF (Fig. 1C and D). This can be
derived from the mean force me cf. Equation (1) required to
constrain interaction members (e.g. TCR and pMHC) at a
number of COM separation distances (Fig. 1A and B).

Several immediate observations can be drawn from Figure 1.
First, force proﬁles obtained by the atomistic and the CG model
are in reasonable agreement for both complexes (Fig. 1A and B).
Second, at a given separation distance r, simulations of nearly
identical starting conformations (identical symbols in Fig. 1A
and B on the distance r) yield a distribution of force values in
both atomistic and CG simulations rather than converging to
some value. Finally, these distributions overlap closely for

distances larger than ~2.75nm (Fig. 1A) and ~5.5nm (Fig.
1B), but diverge at shorter distances.

Next we calculated the average mean force at each distance to
obtain the force profiles F3330), in blue, and Fggna), in green
in Figure 1A and B. We calculated the PMF by numerically
integrating the interpolated Fmean(r) cf. Equation 3 (Fig. 1C
and D). The free energy barrier can now simply be obtained
from the well-depth of the PMF, cf. Equation (4). The resulting
PMFs shown in Figure 1C and D for both complexes provide a
comparison between the free energy minima calculated from the
atomistic and the CG simulations, as well as with the experimen-
tally determined interaction strengths.

For the MPlipl4 complex, atomistic and CG simulations
yielded free energy barriers AG“ 2 132 and 104 kJ mol’l, re-
spectively, both overestimating the reported experimental
AG“ 2 9lkJmol’l (Kurzbauer et al., 2004). For the TCR7
pMHC complex, atomistic and CG simulations yielded free
energy barriers AGO“ = 101 and 80 kJ mol’l, respectively, close
to the experimental values AG“ 2 79.5 kJ mol’1 (Ding et al.,
1999) and AGO“ = 78.6kJmol’l (Davis-Harrison et al., 2007
and see Supplementary Table S1 for further details). As noted
above, a very small correction must be made to the free energy
barrier (Gilson et al.,l997), which amounts to ~4 kJmol’l (see
Supplementary Data for a detailed calculation). To probe the
effect of sampling of the rotational degrees of freedom, for the
MPlipl4 complex, we also calculated the PMF based on a trip-
licate set of long 2ns CG simulations. Supplementary Figure S4
shows ordering is present in the short (2 ns) simulations, as well
as at close distances in the long (2 us) simulations; however, this
ordering disappears at farther distances (>4 nm) in the long
simulations, indicating a strongly improved rotational sampling.
We found a negligible change in the AGoﬂv as a result of this
improved sampling.

Besides interaction strength, Figure 1C and D presents a
comparison between the experimentally reported PPI equilib-
rium distance (the separation distance in X-ray structure) and
the corresponding value from simulations (the distance at the
PMF minimum). We see that the experimental distances were
slightly underestimated by the atomistic PMF in both cases,
whereas the CG PMF appears to yield distances closer to the
crystal structure, especially in the case of TCRipMHC
interaction.

3.2 Computational speed-up

The running time of atomistic MD simulations for MPlipl4 at
the longest COM separation distance r = 4.44 nm was 284 CPU-
hours (CPUh). CG-ing reduced the running time at this distance
to 0.5 CPUh, yielding a 568-fold speed-up. Shorter separations
are progressively faster, but show similar speed-ups. In the case
of the TCRipMHC, this was 1333 and 2.5 CPUh, respectively,
for a speed-up of 533-fold. In total, we invested well over 300 000
CPUh in the atomistic simulations, over the 3 and 10 replicate
calculations for the TCRipMHC and MPlipl4 complexes, re-
spectively. In contrast, the CG simulations for the 456 different
mutants (10 or 20 replicates each) only required ~100 000 CPUh.
The 2 us CG simulations (three replicates) required an additional
64 000 CPUh.

3.3 Evolutionary likelihood of mutations and the
free energy

To obtain a simple, although biologically relevant test case, we
substituted interface core residues in MPlipl4 according to
BLOSUM62 (Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992). We deﬁne two
sets of mutations; one where each residue is mutated into the
evolutionarily most distant residue, and one where it is mutated
into the closest residue type (detailed substitutions in
Supplementary Table S6). One would expect minimal distortion
of the PMF from the closest substitutions, and maximal distor-
tion for the evolutionarily most distant substitutions.

It is clear from the results shown in Figure 2A that when the
interface core composition was altered with the most similar
amino acids, change in the interaction strength remains insigniﬁ-
cant (AAGOff = 7kJmol’l, P<0.38; see Supplementary Table

the most dissimilar amino acids have a strongly disruptive effect
on the PPI that is highly signiﬁcant (AAGOff = 71.5 k] mol’l,
P<10’“; see Supplementary Table S5). However, we still ob-
serve a favourable interaction (AGOff = 32 :l: l3kJmol’l) with
the most dissimilar mutant structure. Note that the force ﬁeld
alone has no such predictive value (see Supplementary Fig. S7).

We have in addition considered all single mutations for each
of the 23 interface core residues for MPlipl4. Of all AAGoffs
with respect to the WT, 16 are signiﬁcant (P50.05 using
Student’s t—test with Hommel multiple testing correction; 121
at P 5 0.05 with just t—test). This corresponds to a detection
limit of about AAGoff 3 8kJmol’l. Figure 2B compares
AAG"ﬂv between all mutants (excluding the WT as the rest of
the protein structure is biased towards the WT amino acid)
with the corresponding BLOSUM62 scores, and shows that
there is a strong correlation between them, as expected. In a
homologue of the TCRipMHC complex, we furthermore
show that we can reproduce experimental AG‘ﬂs for interface
mutations to within the accuracy of our calculations (see
Supplementary Fig. S7).

3.4 The interface core dominates the interaction

Our ﬁnal in silico experiment with the CG model was aimed at
investigating the effective role of interface residues in the inter-
action between two proteins. We first deﬁned classes of residues
based on SASA and distance (Fig. 3, for definitions see Section 2,
a summary is provided in Supplementary Table S2).

We substituted the same number of residues from each class
with randomly chosen amino acids, and calculated the inter-
action strength in the resulting mutant complexes. The resulting
PMFs shown in Figure 4 indicate signiﬁcant disruptive effects of
mutations at the interface core in both the MPlipl4 (P<10’8;
see Supplementary Table S3 for detailed significance values) and
TCRipMHC (P<2 - 104; see Supplementary Table S4),
whereas mutations in the interface rim appear to have very little
inﬂuence on the PMF compared with the WT. Note that in both
complexes, mutations of outer rim sometimes yielded enhanced
interaction strengths.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

In this article, we have set out to answer the following questions.
First, can we use CG MD simulations to get the free energy
barrier with respect to the bound state for PPI that are of similar
accuracy to those from atomistic MD simulations? Second, what
is the gain in speed and overall sampling for CG versus atomis-
tic? Finally, can we get biologically relevant results from the CG
model, similar to what we expect to get from the atomistic model
(at much higher computational cost)?

4.1 Biological relevance

We have shown that by using the CG MARTINI force ﬁeld, we
obtain free energy barriers that are at least as close to the experi-
mental values as those obtained using an atomistic force field.
Moreover, evolutionarily least likely mutations, according to
BLOSUM62 substitution propensities, at the interface core dis-
rupt binding, whereas the most likely mutations hardly inﬂuence

binding. It is important to note here that the residue similarities
from large-scale sequence comparisons, as captured in the
BLOSUM62 matrix, are independent of the MARTINI CG
force ﬁeld.

Likewise, mutations on the interface core have a much more
disruptive effect on the binding than those at the interface rim.
Mutations farther away from the interface have negligible effects.
This is consistent with the findings that residues at the interface
core in general behave much like protein core, whereas interface
rim residues are more similar to those at the surface (e. g.
Tuncbag et al., 2009).

These results show that the CG MARTINI force field is sen-
sitive to changes in the shape and physicochemical properties of

the interface, and suggest it is suitable for studying the effects of
biologically relevant structural changes in PPIs.

Of note, we observe that even the evolutionarily least likely
mutations in the interface core still result in a minimum well in
the PPI PMF, which means that some (weak) afﬁnity is retained.
This may be due to retained shape compatibility of the mutant
interface or due to favourable ‘supporting’ interactions of resi-
dues in the interface rim. This could also explain our ﬁnding that
least likely mutations that are performed only on one side of the
interface (see Supplementary Table S5) have much smaller dis-
ruptive effects on the binding.

We also noticed that some outer interface rim mutations
signiﬁcantly lower the well depth; note that these residues do

not participate in the interaction in the WT complex. This
increased binding strength could be caused by additional
interactions that are introduced by these mutations. We
found that the most signiﬁcantly increased binding strength
occurred in mutants with a higher net charge. This could
mean that either additional salt-bridges contribute to the bind-
ing, or that possibly (additional) counter-ions interact at the
interface to increase the binding strength. Alternatively, the
interface rim is known to infer speciﬁcity through complemen-
tarity of shape and binding properties (Guharoy and
Chakrabarti, 2005), and is therefore not tuned for optimal
binding strength. Likewise, the interface as a whole may not
be evolutionarily optimized for binding affinity, as other func-
tional aspects are also likely to give selective advantages. This
means that there may in fact be ample room for optimization
of the binding afﬁnity in any particular naturally occurring
proteiniprotein interface.

Finally, we do see qualitative differences between the atomistic
and CG PMFs, although our set of two complexes does not
allow us to decide which one is in better agreement with experi-
mental dissociation constants. Underlying reasons for these dif-
ferences are likely related to the different parameterization of
short-range interactions in these force fields. The difference be-
tween the experimental and computed equilibrium distances can
have a number of explanations. The crystal structures represent
vacuum systems in which the protein structure is very rigid,
whereas we simulated systems of solvated ‘breathing’ proteins.
Furthermore, the MARTINI force ﬁeld includes restraints on
the tertiary structure of the protein, whereas the unrestrained
atomistic simulations will allow larger deviations in the interface
on binding. This may explain why equilibrium binding distance
in the CG calculations is closer to the crystal structure than the
atomistic simulations. In any case, a comparison of the experi-
mental equilibrium COM distances to the ones we computed is
expected to yield differences.

4.2 Sampling is crucial

Surprisingly, for both complexes, the CG model appears to be at
least as accurate in approximating the experimental value as the
atomistic model. Part of the reason for that could be better
sampling of the mean force for the CG model where the faster
simulations enabled us to perform 20 independent simulations
for each separation distance, whereas only 3 (TCRipMHC) or
10 (MPlipl4) simulations could realistically be performed for
the atomistic model.

We also ﬁnd that, for a given separation distance, simulations
from slightly different starting conditions do not converge to the
same value of the constraint force (see Fig. 1A and B, >I< and 0
symbols) for both the CG and the atomistic models, and this
effect is strongest at short separation distances. We attribute
this observation to the complex potential energy surface at
small separation distances. Simulations of biomolecules starting
from nearly identical initial conditions are known to get trapped
in local minima (Luo et al., 2006). In general, this can be over-
come as well with sufﬁcient sampling.

The reason we could perform so many more simulations for
the CG model is of course its increased computational efﬁciency,
50(L600 times faster than the atomistic simulations. The primary

reason for this large computational gain is the reduction in par-
ticle density, and the ensuing quadratic decrease in numbers of
pairwise interactions calculated. Moreover, the larger heavier
particles with softer interaction potentials in the CG force ﬁeld
allow much longer integration time-steps without loss of accur-
acy than is possible with the atomistic force ﬁeld. Therefore, we
can conclude that, for all but very small-scale analyses, the
amount of sampling required for accurate determination of the
AGOff barrier can only realistically be achieved using CG models.

Some further efﬁciency could possibly be gained by optimizing
simulation parameters, particularly the integration time-step.
For the atomistic simulations, time-steps of up to At: 5 or 6
fs may be used with negligible loss of accuracy (Feenstra et al.,
1999). A similar speed-up may likewise be achieved in the CG
simulations.

One final challenge regarding the accurate calculation of the
free energy of binding in particular remains largely open: that of
the accurate estimation of loss of rotational entropy on forma-
tion of a protein complex (Chang et al., 2008; Grunberg et al.,
2006; Tamura and Privalov, 1997; Yu et al., 2001). In the results
presented here, at 2ns sampling, the rotational entropy is not
fully sampled (see Supplementary Fig. S4). For the free energy
difference between the bound state and the unbound state, this
would result in a discrepancy between the simulation and the
experiment. However, at the top of the barrier, this error is ex-
pected to be much smaller (Cuendet and Michielin, 2008); our
2ns simulations for the MPlipl4 complex conﬁrm that this
effect can be extremely small. Furthermore, the correction is ex-
pected to be independent of the details of the force field used,
and therefore we can directly compare the results between the
atomistic and CG simulations.

It is interesting to note that we could use the increased
efﬁciency in the CG simulations to directly sample rotational
degrees of freedom, as indicated by the complete loss of orienta-
tional ordering at 2ns and large separation distance (see
Supplementary Fig. S4). It is beyond the scope of this work,
but once sufﬁcient sampling is established, these results can be
used to estimate directly the changes in entropy during the bound
to unbound transition in complexes like this one.

4.3 Limitations of the approach

In this article, we compared two force ﬁelds on two complexes of
known structure. We have shown that for these two complexes,
the interaction proﬁles are highly similar when comparing the
atomistic force ﬁeld to the CG MARTINI force ﬁeld. To claim
generality of these ﬁndings, a larger test set may be required.
However, the computational requirement for the reference simu-
lations using the atomistic force ﬁeld is prohibitive. Additionally
none of the current methods in docking or simulation can predict
binding afﬁnities without knowledge of the bound structure
(Kastritis and Bonvin, 2010).

The comparison has been made by assuming that conform-
ations in the free state as well as in the bound state are relatively
stable. For other complexes, this may be different, e. g. when the
PPI involves ‘induced ﬁt’ effects, especially for highly ﬂexible
binding partners. It is unlikely that the methods proposed here
will be directly applicable to such cases. It should be emphasized
that the atomistic approach is equally unfeasible here, but in that

case due to limits in computational sampling. The in silico mu-
tational study presented here did not account for the possibility
that mutations might disrupt protein secondary structure, as
these kinds of structural rearrangements are not possible in the
MARTINI model.

4.4 Future implications

Our results conﬁrm the dominance of the interface region in
determining the PPI for the two complexes. This opens the pos-
sibility to restrict the simulated system to the interface area and
intervening water only. However, when only a limited volume at
the interface region is simulated, the number of water molecules
in that volume cannot be assumed constant during force calcu-
lation. Rather, this system should be considered at a constant
chemical potential (it) with ﬂuctuating numbers of particles (N),
i.e. the grand-canonical (GC) or pVT ensemble.

Traditionally, MD simulations are performed in the micro-
canonical (NPE), canonical (N VT) or isothermal/isobaric
(NPT) ensemble, as this simpliﬁes calculations and the complex-
ity of the software required (Frenkel and Smit, 2002). We have
recently published a python library interface to the GROMACS
simulation engine (Pool et al., 2012) that enables simulation of a
GC pVT ensemble through a hybrid MD/Monte Carlo integra-
tion scheme.

The combined speed-up achieved by coarse-graining and
volume restriction would be sufﬁcient to incorporate the calcu-
lation of binding free energies into a three-stage approach to PPI
calculation for genomic-scale application. First, non-interacting
protein pairs would be filtered out using cheap sequence-based
methods (e. g. Ezkurdia et al., 2009). Second, docking will be used
to ﬁnd the most likely binding interfaces (Lensink and Wodak,
2010; Pons et al., 2010). In a ﬁnal step, binding energy calcula-
tion will then be used to select the stable complexes (Pool and
Bolhuis, 2010). Although this goal, for now, remains in the
future, it does seem only a few small steps away.

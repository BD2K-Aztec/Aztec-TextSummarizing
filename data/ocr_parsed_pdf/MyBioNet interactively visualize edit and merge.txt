ABSTRACT

Summary: MyBioNet is a web-based application for biological
network analysis, which provides user-friendly web interfaces to
visualize, edit and merge biological networks. In addition, MyBioNet
integrated KEGG metabolic network data from 1366 organisms and
allows users to search and navigate interesting networks.
Availability and Implementation: All KEGG metabolic network data
are organized and stored in the MySQL database. MyBioNet is
implemented in Flex/Actionscript and PHP languages and deployed
on an Apache web server. MyBioNet is accessible through all the
Flash-embedded browsers at http://bis.zju.edu.cn/mybionet/.

1 INTRODUCTION

Owning to the emergence and rapid proliferation of new high-
throughput sequencing technologies, more and more biological
data are produced and are used to infer underlying networks by
means of various methods in systems biology. Network visualization
can map different sorts of biological information onto the graph,
giving researchers new biological insight. In this respect, network
visualization is becoming increasingly important for analyzing large
amounts of data.

Developed network visualizations can be roughly classiﬁed
as either web-based or stand-alone (Gehlenborg et (11., 2010).
Traditional web-based visualization tools, e.g. VisANT (Hu et (11.,
2009), are mostly implemented as Java applets, whereas a few
web-based visualization tools have been developed using the Flash
platform that is browser independent and more ﬂexible for users
to design their custom templates. Cytoscape Web (Lopes et (11.,
2010) is a web-based visualization tool based on the Cytoscape
algorithm, using the Flash platform as a client component to
visualize network data on websites. Another visualization tool,
STRING (Jensen et (11., 2009), utilizes the Flash platform to
visualize protein—protein interactions data on a web server. Both

these applications do not allow users to edit and update a network.
yWorks developed a commercial web application yFiles Flex,
which integrates complicated graph visualization and editing
functionality with an internet application relying on Flash player
(http://www.yworks.com/en/products_yﬁlesﬂex_about.html).
However, this is a canonical network tool, not particularly tailored
for analyzing biological networks, and in addition it is commercial
software.

In this article, we have developed a Web application, MyBioNet,
on a Flash platform. MyBioNet is designed to be a lightweight,
easy to use, web-based tool for analyzing biological networks. It
has important features for biological network operations, including
visualization, editing and merging networks. KEGG (Kanehisa et (11.,
2008) metabolic networks are integrated into MyBioNet, allowing
users to search and navigate the KEGG data conveniently.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

MyBioNet is developed using Adobe Flex Builder 3. The
visualization part of it is based on the secondary development
of Ravis library (http://code.google.com/p/birdeye/wiki/RaVis), an
open source Flex library for data visualization of relational datasets.
MyBioNet can be readily used with Adobe Flash Player installed in
the user’s personal computer.

Biological network data can be imported and exported through
MyBioNet’s predeﬁned XML format. We have also developed a
converter to transform a network ﬁle in a tab-delimited format into
a network ﬁle in a predeﬁned XML format.

MyBioNet visualizes a subnetwork which is based on a speciﬁc
node named as ‘root node’. The subnetwork visualization is centered
around the root node, which is marked in yellow color and can be
easily changed to another node. All surrounding nodes related to
the root node are also shown. The relativity called ‘visible distance’
can be customized freely by users. Visualized subnetwork can be
exported as image ﬁles with the extension ‘jpg’ or ‘gif’

3 FEATURES

Network visualizing: MyBioNet focuses on the visualization of
subnetworks. It enables users to visualize and check different

subnetwork in a large and whole network by setting different node
as root node or taking various visible distances to control the
subnetwork scales. MyBioNet has the basic network visualization
features, which are typically used to map biological information
to nodes and edges. In MyBioNet, node colors show subcellular
locations, node shapes show various types of biological entities and
edge shapes show types of reactions. The features of highlighting and
tooltips of nodes and edges facilitate the navigation of the visualized
network. The highlighted nodes or edges will have speciﬁc views,
e.g. the root node glows yellow. The tooltips show the biological
attributes of nodes or edges.

Network editing: we provided a network editor to enable users
to examine their network data after new experiments or prediction
processing. It is accessible for readily editing networks, including
adding, updating and deleting network items (nodes and edges). With
the editor, new networks can be conveniently created. Furthermore,
users can also edit their networks interactively both in ﬁles and in
the visualized network image.

Network merging: two networks with common nodes or edges
can be merged when it is veriﬁed that these networks share
ﬁinctional modules. Common nodes are deﬁned as items having the
same names and common edges are deﬁned as items connecting
common nodes. Common nodes and edges will be labeled with
the updated properties from the second network. Network merging
can assist users to ﬁnd the relationship between nodes in respective
networks.

Navigate metabolic networks of KEGG: we integrated KEGG
metabolic network data into MyBioNet through KGML ﬁles
downloaded from KEGG. The KEGG data can be queried either by
molecule names or by KEGG IDs among 1366 organisms. Figure 1
shows the metabolic network of Oryza sativajaponica in KEGG. The
search result of KEGG networks can be visualized and exported as
XML ﬁles. Users are allowed to access the detailed information of
the network nodes or edges during navigations. Users can also try
to do network merging between their network data and the KEGG
data to complete the biological networks of particular species.

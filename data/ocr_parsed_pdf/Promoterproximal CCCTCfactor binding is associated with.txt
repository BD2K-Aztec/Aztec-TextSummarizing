ABSTRACT

Motivation: It has been known for more than 2 decades that after
RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) initiates transcription, it can enter into a
paused or stalled state immediately downstream of the transcription
start site before productive elongation. Recent advances in high-
throughput genomic technologies facilitated the discovery that
RNAPII pausing at promoters is a widespread physiologically regu-
lated phenomenon. The molecular underpinnings of pausing are in-
completely understood. The CCCTC-factor (CTCF) is a ubiquitous
nuclear factor that has diverse regulatory functions, including a re-
cently discovered role in promoting RNAPII pausing at splice sites.
Results: In this study, we analyzed CTCF binding sites and nascent
transcriptomic data from three different cell types, and found that
promoter-proximal CTCF binding is significantly associated with
RNAPII pausing.

1 INTRODUCTION

Promoter-proximal pausing of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)
has emerged as a widespread and important step in the regula-
tion of transcription (Core et al., 2008; Gilchrist and Adelman,
2012; Li and Gilmour, 2011; Seila et al., 2009). The role of
pausing is not completely understood, but initial evidence sug-
gests that it allows for precise and rapid transcriptional response
to stimuli such as developmental cues or cellular stressors
(Espinosa, 2010; Li and Gilmour, 2011). The underlying mech-
anisms of RNAPII pausing are thought to be complex (Landick,
2009). Recent publications have reported a few key factors that
regulate polymerase pause site entry and release, including
GAGA (Lee et al., 2008), c—MYC (Rahl et al., 2010), ELL
(Byun et al., 2012) and XRN2 (Brannan et al., 2012); however,
it is not clear whether and how many other complexes are also
involved. As such, this area merits further investigation.

The CCCTC-factor (CTCF) is a multifaceted gene regulator,
with demonstrated roles in transcriptional activation/repression,
insulation, imprinting and chromatin remodeling (Ohlsson et al.,

2010; Phillips and Corces, 2009). In 2011, Shukla et al. published
a seminal article, which reported for the ﬁrst time that CTCF can
facilitate exon inclusion by promoting RNAPII pausing at splice
sites (Shukla et al., 2011). Another recent study postulated that
CTCF may regulate vascular endothelial growth factor transcrip-
tion in part by mediating RNAPII pausing (Lu and Tang, 2012).
Given these reports, and recent observations that at least
20725% of CTCF-binding events are proximal to promoters
(Jothi et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2007), we hypothesized that
CTCF binding may be a cofactor in mediating promoter-
proximal RNAPII pausing. To investigate this possibility, we
analyzed genome-wide nascent RNA data (global nuclear
run-on followed by sequencing; GRO—seq) and empirically deter-
mined CTCF-binding sites from the only three cell types for
which both datasets are publicly available: human cell lines
IMR90 (lung ﬁbroblast) and MCF—7 (breast cancer) and
mouse embryonic stem cells (mES).

2 METHODS
2.1 Datasets

Empirically determined CTCF-binding sites were downloaded from
http://1icr-renlab.ucsd.edu/download.htm1 (CTCF chromatin immuno-
precipitation followed by microarray analysis [ChIP-chip] in IMR90
cells), http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/downloads.html (CTCF chro-
matin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing
[ChIP-seq] in MCF-7 cells) and Chen et al., 2008 (mES ChIP-seq). A11
coordinates were mapped to either the mm9 (mES) or the hg18 (IMR90,
MCF-7) genome builds using the command line liftOver program with
the 7minMatch parameter set to 0.95. CTCF-binding sites were also
computationally predicted by scanning for matches to the canonical
motif (Kim et al., 2007) using the PWM-scan algorithm (Levy and
Hannenhalli, 2002). Global nuclear run-on followed by high-throughput
sequencing (GRO-seq) data were downloaded from Core et al., 2008
(IMR90), Hah et al., 2011 (MCF-7) and Min et al., 2011 (mES).

2.2 Analysis

Promoter-proximal pausing indices were calculated in the following
manner: ﬁrst, for each annotated RefSeq transcript longer than 3kb
(n=27 863 for human, n=22 547 for mouse), we set the transcription
start site (TSS) as position 0, and deﬁned (F500 nt downstream as the
promoter-proximal region and SOO-gene end as the gene body. Second, we
computed the density of RNAPII in both promoter-proximal regions and
gene bodies by calculating GRO-seq reads/nt/mapability using the same
mapability data as in Melgar et al., 2011. Third, for all genes that had at

least one read mapping to the gene body (n=24 988 for IMR90,
n=24613 for MCF-7, n=20 512 for mES), we computed pausing
index as the ratio of RNAPII density in the promoter-proximal region
to RNAPII density in the gene body, similar to previous studies (Core
et al., 2008; Min et al., 2011).

Promoters were divided into two categories: those with and those with-
out a CTCF-binding site overlapping X to Y nt downstream of the TSS,
where X and Y were set in independent experiments to 0 and 100, 101 and
200, 201 and 300, 301 and 500, 501 and 1000 or 1001 and 2000. To
compare pausing indices between categories, we computed the Jaccard
distance in median pausing index as follows: (x — y)/(x + y), where x is the
median pausing index at CTCF-bound promoters and y is the median
pausing index at promoters where CTCF is not bound. The signiﬁcance
of the difference in pausing indices between the two promoter categories
was assessed by one-sided permutation and non-parametric Manni
Whitneinilcoxon (MWW) tests. This analysis was repeated for the
same distances upstream of the TSS.

3 RESULTS

For each cell type, we divided promoters according to whether
CTCF was bound upstream/downstream of the TSS (Section 2).
The number of promoter-proximal CTCF-binding sites was
highly variable across cell types (Supplementary Material 1).

GRO-seq data provide a density map of transcriptionally
engaged RNAPII across the genome by purifying, sequencing
and mapping nascent RNAs (Core et al., 2008). Using recently
published GRO—seq data, we calculated RNAPII pausing indices
at RefSeq-annotated promoters in three different cell types, and
assessed whether promoter-proximal CTCF binding is associated
with elevated RNAPII pausing indices (Section 2). We made two
novel observations:

(1) Genes that exhibit promoter-proximal CTCF binding
(deﬁned as within 100 nt downstream of the TSS) have a signiﬁ-
cantly greater RNAPII pausing index than genes that do not
(Supplementary Material 1). For example, in IMR90 cells, the
median pausing index at promoters with proximal CTCF-bind-
ing sites is ~2—fold greater (permutation test P < 0.0001, Manna
Whitneinilcoxon test P: 1.8 x 10—38) than at promoters
without proximal CTCF-binding sites (Fig. 1). The highly over-
lapping range of pausing indices between the two categories of
promoters indicates that while CTCF binding may be associated
with pausing, it is by no means necessary or sufﬁcient.

Regions of CTCF binding are enriched for motifs with
elevated cytosine (C) content (Jothi et al., 2008). As such, the
observed association between CTCF-binding events and
increased pausing index could be explained by nucleotide com-
position (i.e. cytosine enriched regions may be responsible for the
association with pausing, independent of CTCF binding). To test
this, we repeated the analysis in each cell type with computation-
ally predicted CTCF-binding sites (Section 2), based on the
known C-rich motif (Kim et al., 2007). We did not observe
any association with pausing (Fig. 1; Supplementary Material
1), which strongly suggests that sequence composition alone is
not sufﬁcient to explain the association signal, but rather, the
physical binding of CTCF is required.

(2) The association between CTCF binding and the promoter-
proximal pausing index is position-dependentithat is, the fur-
ther upstream/downstream from the TSS CTCF is bound, the
less of an association there is with RNAPII pausing (Fig. 2;

(Yes) or absence (No) of an empirically determined (IMR90 ChIP-

log10( pausing index+1) for visualization purposes (y-axis). The boxes

the median. The whiskers extend to the most extreme data point that is
no more than 1.5 times the interquartile range from the box. Manni

with promoter-proximal RNAPII pausing is shown. The x-axis represents
the distance (nt) from the TSS (vertical dashed line) of annotated
(RefSeq) genes longer than 3 kb. The y-axis depicts a normalized differ-
ence in median pausing index between promoters with a CTCF-binding
event (ChIP-seq/ChIP-chip peak) and promoters without a CTCF-
binding event (no ChIP-seq/ChIP-chip peak). As such, the value 0.0
(horizontal dashed line) represents ‘no difference’ in median pausing
index between the two groups, a positive value represents increased paus-
ing in promoters with a CTCF-binding event and a negative value rep-
resents decreased pausing in promoters with a CTCF-binding event.
Results are shown for three cell lines (two human: IMR90, MCF-7;

Promoter-proximal CTCF binding

 

Supplementary Material 1). For example, in mES cells, CTCF
binding within 1017200 nt downstream of TSSs is highly signiﬁ-
cantly associated with pausing (permutation test P<0.0001);
however, this association is dramatically weakened for CTCF
binding within 100172000 nt upstream/downstream of TSSs
(permutation test P > 0.5).

4 DISCUSSION

A recent study identiﬁed a novel role for CTCF in polymerase
pausing at splice sites to facilitate exon inclusion (Shukla et al.,
2011). Our ﬁndings provide the first indication that CTCF is
associated with promoter-proximal pausing. It is important to
note that the study does not demonstrate that CTCF binding is
necessary or sufﬁcient for promoter-proximal pausing. Substan-
tial additional experimental work is required to uncover the mo-
lecular underpinnings of the observed association between CTCF
binding and RNAPII dynamics.

The greatest degree of association with pausing is observed for
CTCF-binding sites that are immediately downstream of the
TSS. Therefore, an appealing mechanism for the observed asso-
ciation is steric hindranceithat is, stably bound CTCF may
serve to hinder RNAPII processivity. If this is the case, it is
likely that many other transcription factors with binding sites
immediately downstream of TSSs also associate with RNAPII
pausing. It will be possible to test this hypothesis as more tran-
scription factor (TF) ChIP-seq and GRO—seq data are generated
from the same cell type. We note, however, that because even
sites that are upstream of the TSS are somewhat associated with
pausing, steric hindrance is not likely to be the only mechanism
involved.

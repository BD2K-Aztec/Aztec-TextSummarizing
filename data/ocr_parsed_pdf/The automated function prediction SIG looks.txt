proteins do. He also discussed how disorder leads to tissue—
speciﬁc gene expression and enables rewiring of proteiniprotein
interaction networks in different cellular compartments.

Anna Tramontano discussed her experiences as an organizer
of the Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction
(CASP) (Moult et al., 2013). CASP is one of the oldest critical
assessment challenges in bioinforrnatics, established to under—
stand and improve protein structure prediction programs. Prof.
Tramontano has been prominent in this field for many years,
and has also assessed method performance in several CASP
meetings. She related her experience in CASP as an assessor,
the person who scores the methods based on their performance
using various metrics, and provided insights for future rounds of
CAFA.

Predrag Radivojac and Sean Mooney discussed lessons
learned from the previous CAFA challenge that took place
during 201(L2011, and unveiled the upcoming CAFA 2 experi—
ment. CAFA 2 extends on CAFA1 by adding the Cellular
Component and Human Phenotype Ontologies to the set previ—
ously used for predicting function. A new challenge in CAFA 2 is
the prediction of new functions for proteins that already have
some (incomplete) functional annotation to assess whether par—
tial knowledge about a protein’s function can be successfully
used to computationally predict the missing annotation.

Other interesting discussions during the meeting included a
talk from Christos Ouzounis (University of Toronto, Canada,
and the Institute of Applied Biosciences, Thessalonica, Greece)
entitled ‘We still haz a job: genome annotashuns’, which dis—
cussed the problems associated with error propagation within
databases. Using the example of a typographical error ‘putaive’
(instead of ‘putative’), he demonstrated how this is a problem for
functional annotation, as there are 94 proteins with this annota—
tion in the NCBI protein database with many of these proteins
being homologs. Rachael Huntley from European Molecular
Biology Laboratory—European Bioinformatics Institute
(EMBL—EBI), UK, discussed common misconceptions asso—
ciated with GO. She highlighted how GO annotations should
be used and many of the useful features available including
inter—ontology links and taxon—specifrc GO terms.

AWARDS

In 2013, awards were given for the first time for best poster and
talk. Noah Youngs from New York University received the Best
Talk award for his presentation: ‘Negative Example Selection in
Protein Function Prediction’. Noah proposed that negative an—
notations should be assigned to proteins by looking for GO
terms that are unlikely to co—occur, and that these can be used
to provide negative examples for training sets. Runner—up for
best talk award was Joachim Bargsten from Wageningen
University, The Netherlands, who discussed ‘Integrated
Network— and Sequence—based Protein Function Prediction
Across the Plant Kingdom’.

Nives Skunca from Swiss Federal Institute of Technology
(ETH) Zurich received the Best Poster award for her poster
entitled ‘Assessing protein function predictions in light of the

Open World Assumption’. Her work focused on how false—posi—
tive predictions cannot be confirmed, as predictions that are as—
sessed as false—positive results at one time point may be found to
be correct later on. Runner—up for the best poster award was
Romain Studer from University College London who discussed
‘Identiﬁcation of functional sites in protein structures by combin—
ing evolutionary and physical features’.

In summary, the AFP—SIG 2013 provided a venue for exten—
sive discussion of function prediction ranging across new meth—
ods, assessments by CAFA, issues with such assessments and the
universal resources that are widely used by the field including the
UniProt and Pfam databases and GO. AFP—SIG 2014 will take
place before Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology in Boston
in July 2014, and will feature the results of CAFA 2 in addition
to the many areas relevant to function prediction.

Abstract

Motivation: The prediction of the iron—sulfur proteome is highly desirable for biomedical and biolo—
gical research but a freely available tool to predict iron—sulfur proteins has not been developed yet.
Results: We developed a web server to predict iron—sulfur proteins from protein sequence(s). This
tool, called MetalPredator, is able to process complete proteomes rapidly with high recall and

precision.

Availability and Implementation: The web server is freely available at: http://metalweb.cerm.unifi.

1 Introduction

Metalloproteins are widespread in living organisms and essen—
tial for many biological processes (Andreini et (11., 2008).
Misregulation of levels and usage of metal ions in cells is associated
with major diseases. Thus, identifying potential metalloproteins is
a crucial task not only for the functional characterization of pro—
teins but also for applications in biomedical research and drug de—
sign. Furthermore, knowledge on the complete ensemble of
proteins that bind a specific metal, i.e. each specific metallopro—
teome, permits the study of how organisms evolved to adapt to dif—
ferent metal availability in their environments. The experimental
identification of metal—binding sites can be quite difficult and
costly, especially when attempted at the whole proteome scale.
Consequently, various bioinformatics approaches have been de—
veloped to predict the metal—binding sites in a single sequence
(Andreini et (11., 2004; Gladyshev and Zhang, 2013; Lin et (11.,
2006; Passerini et (11., 2011) but they do not allow metalloproteo—
mics data analyses. Some of the authors of the present article de—
veloped an initial prototype of a tool to predict metalloproteomes
(Andreini et (11., 2011), which however lacked a user—friendly
interface.

We propose a novel computational tool, called MetalPredator,
to predict metal—binding sites in protein sequence(s) at the whole

proteome scale. The tool integrates an existing domain—based ap—
proach (Andreini et (11., 2011) with a new one designed to search for
metal—binding motifs found in proteins with known structure.
MetalPredator uniquely combines global and local searches to de—
fine whether a protein is a potential metalloprotein.

To validate our general methodology, here we focused on the
prediction of the iron—sulfur (Fe—S) proteome, which has recently
been the subject of an extensive body of experimental work world—
wide (Andreini et (11., 2016; Paul and Lill, 2015). Fe—S clusters are
among the most ancient biological metal cofactors and proteins that
bind them (iron—sulfur proteins, ISP hereafter) play crucial roles in
many cellular processes. MetalPredator is, to our knowledge, the
only available tool that performs Fe—S protein/proteome prediction
via a web interface. It featured a very good performance in terms of
precision and recall. MetalPredator is available at http://metalweb.
cerm.unifi.it/tools/metalpredator/.

2 Methods

To identify metal—binding sites in protein sequences, MetalPredator
uses two libraries of Hidden Markov Model profiles that represent
(1) Pfam domains and (2) structural motifs binding Fe—S clusters.
Metal—binding motifs are defined by splitting the Minimal

Functional Sites (MFSs) stored in MetalPDB (Andreini et al., 2013)
into fragments. Each fragment is a continuous stretch of protein se—
quence containing at least one metal ligand. The library (1) was built
as described in (Andreini et al., 2011). It contains the profiles of
both Pfam domains for which the Fe—S cluster ligands are known
and domains annotated as Fe—S cluster binding but lacking informa—
tion on the ligands. To build the library (2) each ISP in MetalPDB
was compared to UniRef50 representative sequences using PSI—Blast.
All the hits with conserved ligands were used to build a sequence
profile. From this profile we extracted the profiles of the distinct
fragments corresponding to the MFS(s) in the initial input sequence.

MetalPredator uses the hmmscan tool (Eddy, 1998) to match
every input sequence to the profiles contained in the libraries. An in—
put sequence is identified as a potential ISP if at least one of these
conditions applies:

(A) The proﬁle of a domain with associated ligands (library 1)
matches the sequence with an e—value lower than 1075 and lig—
ands are conserved in the sequence (Domain search with pat-
tern ﬁlter).

(B) The proﬁle of a domain with no information on ligands avail—
able (library 1) matches the sequence with an e—value lower
than 10’7 (Domain search without pattern ﬁlter).

(C) All fragment proﬁles of a given MFS (library 2) match the se—
quence with an e—value lower than 1073 and the corresponding
ligands are conserved in the sequence (MFS search, Fig. 1).

(D) At least one fragment proﬁle of a given MFS (library 2)
matches the sequence with an e—value lower than 1073 and the
corresponding fragment ligands are conserved in the sequence
(Fragment search, Fig. 1).

We adjusted the above e—value thresholds to have the best F05
measure for each criterion (see Supplementary Table S1). This meas—
ure weighs precision more than recall, thus reducing the number of
false positives in the output as well as the experimental effort needed
to validate the predictions. For the calibration we used two datasets
of sequences (positives and negatives), taken from a subset of the
Protein Data Bank (Berman et al., 2000) filtered at a sequence iden—
tity level of 25% (PDB25). The positive dataset included all 163
ISPs in PDB25. The negative dataset included 2607 PDB25 se—
quences that are not homologous to ISPs, and either bind a metal
ion different from iron in MetalPDB or are not metalloproteins but
contain at least four Cys.

3 Results

3.1 Performance of the tool

To avoid overfitting, we assessed MetalPredator by using a leave—
one—out cross—validation (LOOCV) approach on the entire PDB25.
In LOOCV each training set is created by taking all the samples ex—
cept one, and the test set is the sample left out. The procedure is re—
peated by creating as many training and test sets as are the samples

available. Accordingly, the precision and recall of MetalPredator are
89.1 and 75.5%, respectively (Table 1).

As a further assessment, we repeated the training of
MetalPredator excluding all sequences of Escherichia coli proteins
and then predicted the Fe—S proteome of this organism (Table 1 and
Supplementary Table S2). A very similar approach was used by
(Estellon et al., 2014), using PDB70 as the starting dataset. Our tool
has similar precision (85.2% versus 86.5) and higher recall (88.6%
versus 66.2%) than the ‘Mixed model’ of (Estellon et al., 2014).
Notably, it was possible to build a 3D model for seven of our false
positives, based on homology modeling, showing that they contain a
plausible binding site for a Fe—S cluster (see Supplementary Table
S3). This would make the precision of MetalPredator even higher.

3.2 Description of the web interface

The home page allows users to submit the query protein sequence(s)
in FASTA format by either pasting them directly or uploading a file.
It is possible to provide an e—mail address to receive a notification
when the results are ready. The output is displayed in a Summary
page, which gives an overview of all predicted ISPs. The report con—
tains the results of all predictions based on the criteria A—D
described in the Section 2 in separate columns. Potential ISPs are
ordered according to the number of methods that supported the pre—
diction. The column corresponding to each criterion reports the lo—
cation of the putative Fe—S cluster binding site. It is possible to click
on the site to visualize the details of each prediction. Only for criter—
ion B, the column reports the Fe—S cluster—binding domain identi—
fied. A downloadable csv file is created upon user’s selection of the
columns to be included. Additionally, the interface presents the re—
sults for each method on separate tabs. In each tab, the predicted
ISPs are sorted by e—value. Note that there can be multiple predic—
tions for the same sequence because more than one profile can be
matched with a score better than the selected thresholds. The
Details link pops up the list of all profiles matching a given sequence
with additional information on the match. Filter and Download op—
tions are available to facilitate the analysis of the output.

4 Concluding remarks

The prediction of metalloproteomes is highly desirable for systems
biology and biomedical research efforts. Our tool integrates an
existing methodology for domain—based predictions (Andreini et al.,
2011) and an approach to search for metal—binding motifs, based on
MFSs or fragments thereof. This integration exploits the comple—
mentarity between the global properties of protein domains and the
local nature of MFSs. In the present paper we used our approach to
predict iron—sulfur proteins but, in principle, the methodology can
be straightforwardly applied to search for other groups of metallo—
proteins. MetalPredator can process the entire proteome of any or—
ganism in minutes to a few hours (e.g. for the human proteome),
and thus can be applied to any newly sequenced organism, including
eukaryotes.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: R/qtl is free and powerful software for mapping
and exploring quantitative trait loci (QTL). R/qtl provides a fully
comprehensive range of methods for a wide range of experimental
cross types. We recently added multiple QTL mapping (MQM) to
R/qtl. MQM adds higher statistical power to detect and disentangle
the effects of multiple linked and unlinked QTL compared with
many other methods. MQM for R/qtl adds many new features
including improved handling of missing data, analysis of 100003 of
molecular traits, permutation for determining significance thresholds
for QTL and QTL hot spots, and visualizations for cis—trans and QTL
interaction effects. MQM for R/qtl is the first free and open source
implementation of MQM that is multi-platform, scalable and suitable
for automated procedures and large genetical genomics datasets.
Availability: R/qtl is free and open source multi-platform software for
the statistical language R, and is made available under the GPLv3
license. R/qtl can be installed from http://www.rqtl.org/. R/qtl queries
should be directed at the mailing list, see http://www.rqtl.org/list/.

1 INTRODUCTION

R/qtl is an extensible, interactive environment for the mapping
of quantitative trait loci (QTL) in experimental crosses. It is
implemented as an add-on package for the freely available and
widely used statistical language/software R (R Development Core
Team, 2010). Since its introduction, R/qtl (Broman et (11., 2003)
has become a reference implementation with an extensive guide
on QTL mapping (Broman and Sen, 2009). R/qtl development is
continuous, with input from multiple collaborators and users. We
have introduced a full testing environment with regression testing,
updated the license to the GPL version 3 and hosted the source
code repository on Github, which gives R/qtl software development
high visibility and transparency. The development of R/qtl reﬂects
trends in quantitative genetics, in particular the use of larger
datasets, larger calculations and requirements for controlling the
false discovery rate (FDR). These developments are partly driven by
high-throughput genetical genomics—the name coined for the study
of gene expression QTL (eQTL; Jansen and Nap, 2001), metabolite
QTL (mQTL) and protein QTL (pQTL).

Multiple QTL Mapping (MQM) belongs to a family of QTL
mapping methods, that include Haley—Knott regression (Haley and
Knott, 1992) and composite interval mapping (CIM; Zeng, 1994).
MQM combines the strengths of generalized linear model regression
with those of interval mapping (Jansen, 1993; Jansen and Stam,
1994). Recent developments in QTL mapping include Bayesian
modelling of multiple QTL [e.g. R/qtlbim package (Banerjee et (11.,
2008; Yandell et (11., 2007)]. Bayesian modelling, however, is
computationally expensive, and arguably has little additional power
when applied to high density maps, and (nearly) complete genotype
data (Jansen, 2007). Still, we intend to combine the strengths of the
different methods in future versions of R/qtl.

MQM provides a practical, relevant and sensitive approach
for mapping QTL in experimental populations. The theoretical
framework of MQM was introduced and explored by one of
us (Jansen, 1994) and explained in the ‘Handbook of Statistical
Genetics’ (Jansen, 2007). MQM has one known commercial
implementation (Van Ooijen et (11., 2002), which has been used
effectively in practical research, resulting in hundreds of papers [e.g.
in mouse, plant, and ﬁsh, respectively (de Mooij-van Malsen et (11.,
2009; Jeuken et (11., 2009; Kitano et (11., 2009)]. Now, with MQM
for R/qtl, we present the ﬁrst free and open source implementation
of MQM, that is multi-platform, scalable and suitable for automated
procedures and large datasets.

2 FEATURES

MQM for R/qtl is an automated three-stage procedure in which,
in the ﬁrst stage, missing genotype data are ‘augmented’. (In
other words, rather than guessing one likely genotype, multiple
genotypes are modelled with their estimated probabilities.) In the
second stage, important marker cofactors are selected by multiple
regression and backward elimination. In the third stage, a QTL is
moved along the chromosomes using these preselected markers as
cofactors. QTL are interval mapped using the most informative
model through maximum likelihood. A reﬁned and automated
procedure for cases with large numbers of marker cofactors is
included. The method lets users test different QTL models by
elimination of non-signiﬁcant cofactors. MQM for R/qtl brings
the following advantages to QTL mapping: (1) higher power,
as long as the QTL explain a reasonable amount of variation;
(2) protection against over-ﬁtting, because MQM ﬁxes the residual
variance from the full model, which allows the use of more
cofactors than may be used in, for example, CIM (Zeng, 1994);
(3) prevention of ghost QTL detection (between two QTL in
coupling phase); and (4) detection of negating QTL (QTL in
repulsion phase).

2007). Logarithm of odds (LOD) scores shown at marker positions are scaled (grey circles), with selected cofactors (red circles) and epistasis between multiple

when cofactors are added manually to the model. Here, adding more than two cofactors does not improve the model any further (as discussed in the online

MQM tutorial).

MQM for R/qtl brings additional advantages to genetical
genomics datasets with hundreds to millions of traits: (5) a pragmatic
permutation strategy for controlling the FDR and prevention of
locating false QTL hot spots, as discussed in Breitling et (11. (2008).
Marker data are permuted, while keeping the correlation structure
in the trait data; (6) high-performance computing by scaling on
multi-CPU computers, as well as clustered computers, by calculating
phenotypes in parallel, through the message passing interface (MP1)
of the SNOW package for R (Tierney et (11 ., 2009); (7) visualizations
for exploring interactions in a genomic circle plot (Fig. 1a) and
cis- and trans-regulation (Fig. 1b).

A 40-page tutorial for MQM explores, both the automated
procedure, and the manual procedure of adding and removing
cofactors, in an Arabidopsis thaliana recombinant inbred line (RIL)
metabolite (mQTL) dataset with 24 metabolites as phenotypes
(Fu et (11., 2007). In addition, the tutorial visually explains the
effects of data augmentation, cofactor selection, model selection
and tweaking of input parameters, such as cofactor signiﬁcance.
Genetic interactions (epistasis) are explored through effect plots,

and an example is given of parallel computation. The tutorial is
part of the software distribution of R/qtl and is available online.

3 CONCLUSION

MQM for R/qtl is a signiﬁcant addition to the QTL mapper’s toolbox.
R/qtl provides the user with the most frequently used statistical
analysis methods: single-marker analysis, interval mapping, Haley—
Knott regression (Haley and Knott, 1992), CIM (Zeng, 1994) and
MQM (Jansen, 1994). MQM has improved handling of missing data
and allows more powerful and precise detection of QTL, compared
with many other methods. Not only is this new implementation
of MQM available in the statistical R environment, which allows
scripting for pipe-lined setups, but it is also highly scalable through
parallelization and paves the way for high-throughput QTL analysis.
With MQM, R/qtl is a free and high-performance comprehensive
QTL mapping toolbox for the analysis of experimental populations.
R/qtl now includes permutation strategies for determining thresholds

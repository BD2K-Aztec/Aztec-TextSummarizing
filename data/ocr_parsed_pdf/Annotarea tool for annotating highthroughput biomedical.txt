ABSTRACT

Summary: Computational methods in molecular biology will in-
creasingly depend on standards-based annotations that describe
biological experiments in an unambiguous manner. Annotare is
a software tool that enables biologists to easily annotate their
high-throughput experiments, biomaterials and data in a standards-
compliant way that facilitates meaningful search and analysis.
Availability and Implementation: Annotare is available from http://
code.google.com/p/annotare/ under the terms of the open-source
MIT License (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).
It has been tested on both Mac and Windows.

1 INTRODUCTION

Meta-data describing high-throughput investigations enable unam-
biguous interpretation of experiments, experiment reproducibility
and meaningful searching and analysis of the resulting data.
The microarray community has developed MAGE-TAB (Rayner,
2006), an annotation format for microarray data. MAGE-TAB
allows laboratories to manage, exchange and publish well-
annotated biomedical data using a spreadsheet-based paradigm.
Several public repositories and analysis tools for microarray data
such as ArrayExpress (Parkinson, 2009), Stanford Microarray
Database (SMD) (Hubble, 2009), MeV (Saeed, 2006), Bioconductor
(Gentleman, 2004) and caArray (Klemm et al., 2010) support
microarray data submissions with MAGE-TAB annotations, and
open source tools are available for conversion of legacy formats
into MAGE-TAB (Rayner, 2009).

In order to improve the volume, quality and granularity of
annotations, there is a compelling need for software that enables
biologists to easily annotate such data. We describe Annotare, a tool
that facilitates annotation of gene expression data in MAGE-TAB
format. Annotare is available under the terms of the MIT License at
http://code.google.com/p/annotare/.

2 SOFTWARE COMPONENTS

Annotare is a stand-alone desktop application that features (i) a
set of intuitive editor forms to create and modify annotations;
(ii) support for easy incorporation of terms from biomedical
ontologies; (iii) standard templates for common experiment types;
(iv) a design wizard to help create a new document; and (v) a
validator that checks for syntactic and semantic violations (Fig. l).

The front-end graphical user interface (GUI) uses Adobe AIR.
This enables Annotare to run on multiple operating systems, and
also sets the stage for future work to translate the desktop version to
the web (see Section 3). Backend modules are built using Java, and
the data communication between Adobe AIR and Java modules is
supported by the Merapi messaging technology. Annotare has been
tested on Windows XP2 and Mac OS (10.5 or greater).

2.1 Annotations editor

Annotare has a set of easy-to-use GUIs to view and modify
annotations for an experiment. Using the forms, users can record

details such as author’s contact information, experimental design,
protocols used, publications and relationships between biological
materials used and data produced.

The GUI hides the syntactic complexity of MAGE-TAB as
much as possible. A spreadsheet edit-and-view paradigm allows
annotation of the relationships between biomaterials and data. A
column designer complements the spreadsheet functionality by
grouping relevant MAGE-TAB column options together, facilitating
the addition or deletion of columns, while obviating the need to know
the correct column ordering.

2.2 Ontology support

The most challenging part of creating MAGE-TAB annotations
can be using the correct terms from appropriate biomedical
ontologies to describe an experiment in an unambiguous fashion.
Examples of information that use controlled vocabularies include
experimental design, experimental factor types, protocol types and
sample characteristics. To support use of controlled vocabularies,
Annotare includes the Experiment Factor Ontology (Malone
et al., 2010). Annotare exploits an ontology auto-complete
function. Annotare also supports an ontology widget that is
enabled with ontology look-up services of the NCBO Bioportal
(http://bioportal.bioontology.org/). The widget allows users to
search for and use appropriate terms from many ontologies, such
as the MGED Ontology (Whetzel, 2006).

2.3 Standard templates

A researcher should not have to start from a blank slate in order to
annotate experiments. Annotare provides a set of standard templates,
covering common species and experimental designs (i.e. a time
series). Users can select templates that best match experiments and
get pre-formatted MAGE-TAB that can then be completed with
experiment-speciﬁc data. Custom templates can also be created and
saved for use in future experiments.

2.4 Design wizard

In addition to experiment templates, Annotare has a design wizard
that helps users create a MAGE-TAB. The wizard takes the
user through a series of questions eliciting information about the
experimental design, the number of channels, the labels used for
each channel, and platform and protocol information. Based on the
user’s answers, the wizard generates partial annotations that the user
can then complete using the editor. In the process of generating
annotations, the wizard taps into an internally stored knowledge
base of rules and mappings that connect various experiment designs,
species, technology vendors, array designs and protocols.

2.5 Validator

The MAGE-TAB speciﬁcation imposes a set of syntactic and
semantic rules on the layout and content of MAGE-TAB documents.
Users can invoke Annotare’s validator component at any time
in order to check if a document complies with these rules.

The validator ﬂags any violations as errors, warnings or missing data.
It employs the Limpopo Parser, a library for MAGE-TAB parsing
and validation, developed by ArrayExpress.

3 DISCUSSION

Annotare is a collaborative open-source software development effort
involving many institutions. The tool is freely available from
Annotare’s project web site http://code.google.com/p/annotare/.
Updates and improvements are planned in response to current
usability studies. A web-based version of Annotare is also under
development. Not only will a web-based version be able to take
advantage of ﬁnding key ontology terms or publications via the
internet, but it will be conﬁgurable so that it can be directly
connected to a software package or database. Both ArrayExpress
and SMD will provide access to the web-based Annotare tool to
construct and view high-throughput experimental annotations.

In addition to the web-based version of Annotare, future work will
provide support for the MAGE-TAB version 1.1 as well as RNA-seq
data. In particular, Annotare will be extended to allow researchers
to annotate their RNA-seq or ChIP-seq experiments to satisfy the
MINSEQE data sharing requirements for high-throughput sequence
data (A.Brazma et al., submitted for publication).

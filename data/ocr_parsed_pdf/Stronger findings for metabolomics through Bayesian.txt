We achieve this by introducing another level of hierarchy to the
peak—clustering model (Suvitaival et al., 2014). We show that by
not only clustering spectral peaks into latent compounds but in
addition by clustering these compounds into coherently respond—
ing latent groups, we can detect weak covariate effects in the data
more accurately.

2 METHODS

The method introduced in this work extends the peak-clustering
model (Suvitaival et al., 2014) to reduce the risk of false discoveries in
highly collinear metabolomic data. We address the problem of small
sample size and low signal-to-noise ratio by introducing stronger struc-
ture to the model. This enables us to detect weak covariate effects that
are present in multiple compounds.

In this section, we describe the proposed hierarchical Bayesian two-
level model. In the equations that follow, we use the indices 1', j, m, k and l
to denote the samples, the variables, the ﬁrst-level clusters, the second-
level clusters and the covariate level of the sample, respectively, as

1': l, . . . , N (samples, i.e. experimental runs),

j= l, . . . , P (variables, i.e.peaks),

m= l, . . . , M (ﬁrst-levelclusters, lie. compounds),
k: l, . . . , K (second-levelclusters, lie. groups of compounds),
I = l, . . . , Lu (covariatelevel, i.e. sample group)

where N, P, M, K and L, are their respective total numbers.

The observed data are the spectral peaks, indexed by j, following their
identiﬁcation in the samples, indexed by 1'. However, the association be-
tween the peaks and the compounds, indexed by m, is unknown as is the
total number, M, and the identity of the compounds.

The data on the peaks are organized into two arrays: ﬁrst, the peak
height information is arranged into a P—by—N matrix X e RPXN, which
after the log -transformation and centering based on the control group,
I = l, is real valued with missing values where a peak was not detected.
Secondly, the peaks’ pairwise similarity information is arranged into the
array Q e [0, 1]NXPXP . We choose to measure the similarity between two
spectral peaks by computing the Pearson correlation between the peaks
over a retention time window. This leads to a measure, where peaks j and
j’, if co-occurring within the retention time window in the sample 1', have a
positive similarity value guy. Similarity values for pairs with a
missing peak or a negative correlation coefﬁcient are set to zero and
thus are effectively considered as missing values in the model. The peak
similarity data enable the model to cluster together adduct and
isotope peaks, which have a different mass-to-charge ratio but which
appear at a coinciding retention time.

2.1 Peak clustering based on chromatographic similarity

We follow the approach detailed by Suvitaival et a]. (2014) in the
peak-clustering stage, presented brieﬂy here for completeness.

In the following equations for inferring the P—by—M clustering
matrix V, we use the variable 81- j E vj‘,v}‘,‘, e {0, l} to indicate whether
the peaks j and j’ are in the same or different clusters (1 or 0, respectively).
In the notation, the subset operator ‘-’ indicates that the entire
dimension of the array is includedihere, all the M clusters (columns)
of the clustering matrix V.

2.1.1 Peak Similarity A pair of peaks from one compound can
only occur close by in retention time, whereas a pair of peaks from
two different compounds does not have such restriction set by the
measurement device. This means that the observed similarity between
same-compound peaks is expected to be higher than between

different-compound peaks. Thus, the similarity value q,“ between
the peaks j and j’ in a sample 1' is assumed to have been generated
by one of the two components, ‘in’ or ‘out’, both of which are a spike-
and-slab mixture (Mitchell and Beauchamp, 1988) with a beta
distribution as the ‘slab’. These two components are parametrized as

17([1zzjtj’ lam” = 1) = (1 —PE“)Beta(qw lainv bin)

. (1)

+Pb“5(qin’)

for a pair of peaks in the same cluster and
17(4ijj lay" = 0) = (1 — P3”‘)Beta(4tjj laoutv bout) (2)

+1’3”“3(4m’)

for a pair of peaks in different clusters. Both of the beta
distributions have parameters a and b, which are set in the way that
the same-cluster and different-cluster components favor large and small
values of similarity qty), respectively.

In Equations (1) and (2), missing values are modeled through the
‘spike’ 8, which is a Dirac delta function that introduces a point mass
at value zero of its argument. Many missing values are expected, as
peaks from two different compounds rarely appear at the same time.
The prior probability of a missing value is determined by 170, which
receives a higher value in the different-compound component than in
the same-compound component. Different retention time, thus, is
strong evidence for assigning the peaks into different clusters.

The likelihood,

for the data, Q, is then computed through a product over all the samples,
all the pairs of peaks, and the same-compound and different-compound
terms.

2.1.2 Unknown compounds To accommodate the unknown set
of compounds in the data, we set a Dirichlet process prior (Escobar,
1994) for the peak clusters. In this way, we not only can infer the assign-
ments of the peaks into clusters representing the compounds but we
can also infer the number of compounds, M, in the data, leading to a
P—by—M clustering matrix V.

In the Dirichlet process for the cluster assignments of the
peaks, the probability of the assignment of a peak j into an existing
cluster m,

17(Vj‘m =   (X Smﬁ  ., Vj‘m =  

is weighted by the number of other peaks in the cluster, Sm E va‘mvzj-‘m.
The probability is not dependent on the previous assignment of the peak
j, which is left out both from the likelihood term and from the
count. This is expressed in the equation by the subset operator Lj’
that excludes the row j from the clustering matrix V. As an alternative
to the existing M clusters, a new cluster is created with the probability

17(Vj.M+1=1|Q,V) (x ozng (le4 ,, Wt] = 1) (5)

which is affected by the Dirichlet process concentration parameter am.

We infer the posterior distribution of the model via Gibbs
sampling. Following the sampling, we acquire a point estimate of
the distribution of the clustering as the least-squares clustering (Dahl,
2006) relative to the posterior mean clustering. The inferred
clustering, V, is then used as a preprocessor for the inference of
covariate effects, which is discussed next.

3 RESULTS

Next, we show that we can beneﬁt from the inherent structure of
the mass spectral data in two ways: ﬁrst, we can make the infer—
ence of compound—speciﬁc covariate effects more accurate by
using multiple peaks from the compound. Second, in the regime
of low signal—to—noise ratio, we can further improve the accuracy
by imposing stronger structure on the model, and infer the cov—
ariate effects on groups of coherently responding compounds.

We present experimental results on simulated data and meta—
bolomic benchmark data (Franceschi et al., 2012) with known
changes in the concentrations of chemical compounds.

In the experiments, we compare three approaches for the in—
ference of covariate effects:

0. Single peak. The standard ANOVA model, where the
covariate effects are computed as the average difference of
the intensity of a single peak between the sample groups.

1. I—level. A Bayesian approach for inferring the covariate
effects using data from multiple spectral peaks (Suvitaival
et al., 2014).

2. 2—level. The Bayesian approach proposed in this work for
inferring the covariate effects through the two—level cluster—
ing of peaks and coherently responding compounds.

We evaluate each approach by its accuracy at inferring the
covariate effects. The accuracy is measured in terms of the
mean squared error (MSE).

3.1 Simulated data

We demonstrate the new approach through simulated experi—
ments in regimes, which imitate real metabolomic experiments
by their sample size, number of peaks associated with a compound
and the general level of noise. We present three experiments where
we studied three different aspects of the inference task: (i) the
presence of multiple unchanged compounds, (ii) the strength of
the change, and (iii) the number of coherently changing com—
pounds. These three experiments are detailed in their respective
subsections that follow next. The experiments are summarized in
Table 1.

model and the two comparison approaches was tested with the two—sided paired

false discovery rate. The result is from the ﬁrst simulated experiment (Section 3.1.1).

3.1.] Presence of multiple unchanged compounds In the ﬁrst
simulated experiment, we studied the simultaneous inference of
multiple zero and non—zero covariate effects. We generated data
with seven similarly responding clusters of compounds, each
compound producing seven peaks.

When comparing the inferred covariate effects with the true
effects, the two peak—clustering models always had a lower error
compared with the single—peak approach (Table 2). Most import—
antly, the added structure of the two—level model prevented the
model from overfitting to the noisy data and improved the ac—
curacy at small and diminishing covariate effects, leading to a
decrease in false discoveries.

The number of the higher—level clusters, K, and the variance
parameter, 1/12, were selected jointly via stratified nested 5—fold
cross—validation. The procedure was repeated with ﬁve independ—
ent datasets.

3.1.2 Strength of the change In the second simulated experi—
ment, we studied how the signal—to—noise ratio of the true cov—
ariate effect inﬂuences the accuracy of inference. We generated

independent datasets with seven compounds and progressively
increased the generated covariate effect.

The covariate effect was inferred the most accurately by the
two—level model throughout the experiment (Fig. 2a). The accur—
acy of the model—based approaches decreased slightly when the
strength of the true effect increased. This followed from the prior
assumption that prevents the model from overfitting to unexpect—
edly strong covariate effects. The prior for the covariate effects
places most of the probability mass around zero and thus effect—
ively sets a bias for the inferred effects toward zero (Fig. 2b). The
data—based single—peak approach does not have this bias, but its
conﬁdence intervals were considerably wider, which lead to a
larger error in the inference task. The effects in any real meta—
bolomic dataset most probably are in the weak regime, where the
bias is overshadowed by the noise in the data.

3.1.3 Number of coherently changing compounds In the third
simulated experiment, we studied how the number of coherently
responding compounds influences the accuracy of the two—level
model. We generated data with a weak covariate effect and grad—
ually increased the number of compounds.

We discovered that the accuracy of the two—level model
increased as the number of coherently responding compounds
increased (Fig. 3). The experiment empirically conﬁrmed the ex—
pected connection between the two Bayesian models: when there
was only one responding compound, the two—level model ef—
fectively reduced to the one—level model in terms of the error.
As expected, the performance of the single—peak approach and
the one—level model remained constant throughout the
experiment.

3.2 Benchmark data with known changes in
concentrations

Next, we applied the method on real ultra performance liquid
chromatography—mass spectrometry data (Franceschi et al.,
2012). The recently published benchmark dataset of apple sam—
ples includes a set of annotated spike—in compounds with a
known increase in the concentration. The samples have been
measured in both the positive and negative ion modes.

We started with the raw spectral data [The raw spike—in
dataset by Franceschi et al. (2012) is available online at http://
cri.fmach.eu/Research/Computational—Biology/Biostatistics—and—
Data—Management/download/data/Spiked—Apple—Data (June 11,
2013, date last accessed)] to acquire the shapes of the peaks in
addition to their heights. The data were preprocessed using
MZmine 2 (Pluskal et al., 2010) with default settings.

We evaluated the approaches by the MSE between the inferred
and the true covariate effects. If a cluster contained multiple
annotated peaks, the error was computed for each of the anno—
tated peaks. Clusters with no annotated peaks were assumed to
have a 0% true effect. The effect of the single—peak approach was
computed as the average change of the strongest peak of the
cluster.

The number of higher—level clusters and the variance param—
eter were selected jointly through a stratiﬁed nested 5—fold
cross—validation from the sets K e {1, 2, . . ., 10} and
1/12 e {0.25, 0.5, . . . , 1.5}, respectively. Model selection and valid—
ation was done independently for the positive and negative ion
mode datasets.

The analyses for the data from both the ion modes lead to an
outcome, where the Bayesian models were more accurate at

covariate effect. The prior-induced bias lead to a slight increase in the error of the peak-clustering models as the true effect increased but acted to prevent
the models from overﬁtting and thus from false ﬁndings at normal effect sizes. (a) Pairwise difference in the error between the single-peak approach and

Fig. 3. The error in the covariate effect inferred by the compound-clus-
tering model (‘2-level’) decreased when more coherently responding com-
pounds were observed. The accuracy of the peak-clustering model and
the data-based single-peak approach (‘l-level’ and ‘Single peak’, respect-
ively) remained constant. Root mean squared error (RMSE) is shown as
a function of the number of compounds (i.e. lower-level clusters) per
higher-level cluster. Result from the third simulated experiment

the number of compounds was gradually increased from 1 to 19

inferring the covariate effects than the single—peak approach by a
signiﬁcant margin (Table 3). The two—level model improved the
accuracy compared with the one—level model at weak effect sizes.
It is worth noting that the results were strongly in line with the
simulated experiments (Section 3.1.1).

4 CONCLUSION

Additional spectral peaks produced by the mass spectrometer as
a result of the ionization process have been shown to be useful
for the inference of covariate effects when multiple peaks can be
confidently associated with one compound. However, even with
multiple peaks supporting the inference, small covariate effects
may be hidden under the between—sample variation. We ad—
dressed this problem by introducing stronger structure to the
model of the covariate effects, thereby regularising the covariate
effects and making them less dependent on the variation of in—
dividual compounds.

We achieved an improvement in the accuracy of the inferred
covariate effects by assuming a structure of coherently respond—
ing compounds in the data. We proposed a structured model for
inferring covariate effects for groups of compounds through two
layers of probabilistic clustering. Metabolomic data are known
to have collinear structure for similar compounds. This phenom—
enon is argued to arise from the biological processes that the
compounds are involved in. However, the method proposed in
this work does not restrict the groups of compounds by their

Table 3. The two-level model is most accurate at small levels of covariate
effects and both the Bayesian models are more accurate than the single-
peak approach on the metabolomic benchmark data (Section 3.2)

chemical or biological similarity but infers the groups only
based on their responses to the covariates.

In the experiments, we showed that the two—level model pro—
posed in this work decreases the error of inferred covariate ef—
fects in a typical setting, where the true effects are small or
diminishing. Through three simulated experiments, testing the
approaches with multiple zero—effect clusters, varying effect size
and varying number of similarly responding compounds, we
demonstrated that the two—level model is more accurate at infer—
ring weak covariate effects from noisy multipeak data when
compared with the two comparison approaches. The outcome
was repeated on a metabolomic benchmark dataset with known
changes in the compound concentrations. Following the reduc—
tion in the error for the weak covariate effects, the two—level
model is argued to reduce false ﬁndings.

To further improve the consistency of the inferred covariate
effects, we suggest the following avenues of research: (i) prior
knowledge about the similarity of the compounds can be incor—
porated into the prior of the higher—level clustering, either in
terms of the biological processes in which the compounds are
involved or in terms of the chemical similarity of the compounds.
(ii) The lower—level clustering can be improved to detect even the
weakest peaks by incorporating prior knowledge about the rela—
tive positions of the peaks associated with one compound. This is
possible thanks to the fact that the expected positions of many
adduct and isotope peaks can be calculated based on the ioniza—
tion process and the chemical formula of the compound, respect—
ively. (iii) The covariate effects in the isotope peaks are argued to
be highly preserved because the isotope peaks do not arise from
variation in the ionization process. Additionally, the expected
relative heights of these peaks can be calculated if the identity

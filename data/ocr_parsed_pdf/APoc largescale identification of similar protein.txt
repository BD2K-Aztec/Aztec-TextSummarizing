ABSTRACT

Motivation: Most proteins interact with small-molecule ligands such
as metabolites or drug compounds. Over the past several decades,
many of these interactions have been captured in high-resolution
atomic structures. From a geometric point of view, most interaction
sites for grasping these small-molecule ligands, as revealed in these
structures, form concave shapes, or ‘pockets’, on the protein’s sur-
face. An efficient method for comparing these pockets could greatly
assist the classification of ligand-binding sites, prediction of protein
molecular function and design of novel drug compounds.

Results: We introduce a computational method, APoc (Alignment of
mkets), for the large-scale, sequence order-independent, structural
comparison of protein pockets. A scoring function, the Pocket
Similarity Score (PS-score), is derived to measure the level of similarity
between pockets. Statistical models are used to estimate the signifi-
cance of the PS-score based on millions of comparisons of randomly
related pockets. APoc is a general robust method that may be applied
to pockets identified by various approaches, such as ligand-binding
sites as observed in experimental complex structures, or predicted
pockets identified by a pocket-detection method. Finally, we curate
large benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance of APoc and
present interesting examples to demonstrate the usefulness of the
method. We also demonstrate that APoc has better performance
than the geometric hashing-based method SiteEngine.

1 INTRODUCTION

In a biological cell, small-molecule ligands, such as metabolites
or drug compounds, constantly interact with their protein recep-
tors. This gives rise to or modulates various aspects of protein
function. Understanding how these interactions take place has
been one key goal of many research efforts for several decades
(Alberts, 2008). Accompanying the advance of structural deter-
mination techniques such as X-ray crystallography and NMR,
tens of thousands of structures of proteins in complex with
small-molecule ligands have been determined at atomic reso-
lution and deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Berman
et al., 2000). Thus, there is a diverse collection of high-resolution

snapshots of proteiniligand interactions that can be examined to
help provide functional insight.

Ligand-binding sites on protein surfaces, where direct physical
contacts form between small-molecule ligands and proteins, are
of special interest. From a structural prospective, most of these
sites are located within a concave-shaped structure known as a
‘pocket’ (Laskowski et al., 1996; Liang et al., 1998). Owing to
this characteristic, a pocket may be detected through a geomet-
rical analysis of protein structure. Consequently, a number of
methods have been developed to predict ligand-binding sites ex-
ploiting the idea. Among them, SURFNET uses a sphere-ﬁlling
technique to locate a pocket (Laskowski, 1995), POCKET
(Levitt and Banaszak, 1992) and LIGSITE (Huang and
Schroeder, 2006) adopt grid-based approaches and CAST iden-
tiﬁes the pocket through Delaunay triangulation and the a-shape
theory (Binkowski et al., 2003). Alternatively, several methods
using energy-based or template-based strategies have also been
proposed [see a recent review (Perot et al., 2010)]. It should be
recognized that a protein surface is bumpy and the boundaries of
pockets depend on a series of extrinsic (and to some extent
arbitrary) choices, e. g. how far should a pocket extend towards
the open space, and how high must a ridgeline be for it to delin-
eate two disjoint, but adjacent, pockets versus a single united
pocket.

The large number of available structures in the PDB provides
opportunities for comparative studies of ligand-binding pockets
(Gold and Jackson, 2006; Kahraman et al., 2007; Minai et al.,
2008; Zhang and Grigorov, 2006). In general, small-molecule
ligands can interact with proteins of different structural folds.
Do pockets that recognize similar ligands share some common
structural features? If such features exist, can we use it to predict
protein function? To answer these questions, global structural
comparison often is not adequate, and it is necessary to develop
methods for local structural comparison dedicated to the geo-
metric and/or physicochemical features of the protein pockets
themselves. Among existing methods for pocket comparison, a
heuristic maximum clique finding algorithm has been widely im-
plemented, e.g. as in Cavbase (Schmitt et al., 2002), IsoCleft
(Najmanovich et al., 2008) and SOIPPA 0(ie and Bourne,
2008). In these methods, pockets are represented by pseudo-
atoms, all-atoms or Cat atoms, and an associated graph is
generated, wherein nodes are pairs of atoms from two pocket
structures and edges represent a similarity relationship. The max-
imum clique found in this graph corresponds to the optimal
alignment between the pocket structures. Another popular type
of algorithm used for aligning pocket-lining residues is geometric
hashing, e.g. SiteEngine (Shulman—Peleg et al., 2004). Instead of
using atoms to represent a pocket, spherical harmonics (Morris
et al., 2005) or 3D Zernike descriptors (Chikhi et al., 2010) have

been proposed to describe protein pockets. The reduced pocket
descriptors permit fast computation, but they do not return a
detailed alignment of pocket residues, which is useful for certain
studies, such as the identiﬁcation of mutations corresponding to
subtle changes of substrate speciﬁcity.

An existing pocket comparison method is usually tied with a
speciﬁc pocket-detection procedure, and it is difﬁcult to extend
its usage to generic pockets detected by different procedures.
This difficulty is partly caused by the fact that many scoring
functions for measuring pocket similarity are dependent on the
size of the pockets (Davies et al., 2007); different pocket detec-
tion methods can assign different sizes and/or numbers of pock-
ets for the same structure. As in the case of a global structural
alignment, a linear normalization of a similarity score by the size
of a pocket does not eliminate the size-dependence issue, which is
usually non-linear. Most approaches do not properly estimate
the statistical signiﬁcance of their similarity score. This becomes
an issue when one performs large-scale comparisons of the entire
PDB (Davies et al., 2007).

To address these issues, we introduce a new method, APoc, for
the sequence order-independent structural alignment of pockets
on protein surfaces. Below, a length-independent scoring func-
tion PS-score is ﬁrst introduced. This is followed by a description
of the algorithm, which includes iterative dynamic programming
and iterative integer programming procedures to obtain an
optimal sequence order-independent alignment between two pro-
tein pockets. We then introduce Subject/Control sets for large-
scale benchmark tests, and describe the results of APoc on three
types of pockets detected by different pocket-detection methods.
Two interesting examples from the benchmark sets are presented.
Finally, we compare the performance of APoc to a publicly
available method SiteEngine.

2 METHODS

2.1 Scoring function

Previously, our group developed the Template Modelling score
(TM-score) for measuring protein global structural similarity (Zhang
and Skolnick, 2004, 2005) and the Interface Similarity score (IS-score)
for evaluating proteiniprotein interface similarity (Gao and Skolnick,
2010a, b, 2011). Here, for measuring pocket similarity, we introduce
the Pocket Similarity score (PS-score) that is based on backbone geom-
etry, side-chain orientation and chemical similarity of the aligned
pocket-lining residues. A typical study requires comparing a query
pocket structure against a template library of pockets generated by
some pocket-detection method, which we will describe below. The
length of a pocket is deﬁned by the number of Car atoms of the pocket
residues. Suppose an alignment is obtained between a query of length LQ
and a template of length LT. The PS-score of the alignment is

PS-score = (S + so)/(1 + so) (1)
1 Na
S = L—Qrgugx[;piri/(l + elf/013)] (2)
I" — {max(0.l,0.5 + c056,) if9,->J'r/3 (3)

r,— = max(0.8, 8(a-Q a-Ti» (4)

1’1

Here, Na is the number of aligned residue pairs, d,- is the distance in A
between the Car atoms of the ith aligned residue pair and the empirical
scaling factor do E 0.70(LQ— S)1/4—0.2. The constants in do were ob-
tained by ﬁtting the distribution of Car distances in random alignments of
pockets. The factor [7,- measures, in the two pockets, the directional simi-
larity between two Car to CB vectors, which span an angle 6,- at the ith
alignment position of two non-glycine residues. For glycine, the value of
p,- is assigned 1 if both amino acids are glycines and is assigned 0.77 if only
one residue is glycine. The latter value is the mean [7,- derived from
random alignments. The factor r,- measures the chemical similarity of
two aligned amino acids. The function 8(aiQ,a,—T) gives a value of 1 if
the two amino acids a?,a,.T belong to the same group (17VIII) deﬁned
as: I (LVIMC), 11 (AG), 111 (ST), IV (P), V (FYW), VI (EDNQ), VII
(KR), VIII (H) (Zhang and Grigorov, 2006), and 0 otherwise. The scaling
factor so E 0.23 — 12/LQ1'88 ensures that the score of the random pockets
of similar length has a mean score independent of their length (see below).

To calculate the distance d,- and pi, aligned residues are superimposed
with the Kabsch algorithm (Kabsch, 1976) to minimize the RMSD of the
full or subset of aligned residues. Therefore, the number of all possible
superpositions exponentially increases as the alignment length grows. The
notation ‘max’ in Equation 2 indicates that the PS-score corresponds to
the superposition that gives the maximum of all scores. In practice, a
heuristic iterative extension algorithm is used to calculate the PS-soore,
similar to the one used for calculating the TM-score (Zhang and
Skolnick, 2004). Note that identical pocket structures give a PS-score
of one, which is the upper bound of the PS-score.

2.2 Alignment algorithm

To ﬁnd the optimal alignment between two pockets, we adopted a strat-
egy that is similar to iAlign, an algorithm for ﬁnding the optimal sequen-
tial alignment between two proteiniprotein interfaces (Gao and Skolnick,
2010a, b). A ﬂowchart of the algorithm is illustrated in Figure 1. The
algorithm has three major phases: In the ﬁrst phase, several guessed
solutions are generated through gapless alignments, secondary structure
comparison, fragment alignments and local contact pattern alignments.
Starting from these guessed alignments, dynamic programming is itera-
tively applied during the second phase. This yields optimal sequential
alignments between two pocket structures. In the third phase, an iterative
procedure is conducted to search for a non-sequential alignment between
two pockets, which is then selected if this alignment gives a better
PS-score than the optimal sequential alignment. The problem of ﬁnding
an optimal non-sequential alignment (or match) is converted to the
Linear Sum Assignment Problem (LSAP), which is a special case of

integer programming and is also equivalent to the problem of ﬁnding a
maximum weight matching in a weighted bipartite graph. To solve LSAP
efﬁciently, we implemented the shortest augmenting path algorithm
(Derigs, 1985), which has a polynomial time complexity of 0(N3),
where N: max(LT, LQ).

By default, our pocket program also performs a global structural align-
ment of the two full-length protein structures using the algorithm imple-
mented in TM-align (Zhang and Skolnick, 2005). The feature is useful if
one is also interested in comparing global structural similarity. Global
alignment may also be used to produce an initial pocket alignment seed if
the pocket regions are covered in the global alignment. In our benchmark
test, this additional seed only gives a minor improvement; in <1% of
cases does the PS-score increase by 0.01 or more.

2.3 Pocket detection

Three pocket-detection methods are used in this study. The ﬁrst is
LIGSITE (Huang and Schroeder, 2006), which is geometry based. A
grid size of 1 A and an SSS_threshold of 5 is used. LIGSITE is modiﬁed
to report individual grid points within each pocket, and surface residues
within 4.5A of these points are deﬁned as pocket residues. The second is
an in-house pocket-detection algorithm CAVITATOR that is very much
in the spirit of LIGSITE, with a similar grid size, but which is designed to
be less sensitive to minor structural distortions. Each heavy atom occu-
pies the central grid point and all adjacent grid points within J2 A. Thus,
a single heavy atom occupies 27 grid points at a grid spacing of 1A. In
order for a point to be part of a pocket, it must be bounded by occupied
points on both sides along the X, Y or Z directions. The source code and
Linux executable are available at http://cssb.biology.gatech.edu/
Cavitator. Lastly, ligand-contacting residues on protein surface are de-
tected by applying the program LPC (Sobolev et al., 1999). LPC requires
structures of protein/ligand complexes and yields a list of observed
ligand-binding pocket residues. By comparison, the ﬁrst two methods
do not use ligand information as part of the pocket-prediction procedure.
When applying these methods, we consider pockets with >10 residues.
Note that the pockets detected by the ﬁrst two geometric methods are
usually much larger than the corresponding pocket detected by LPC.

The volume detected by LIGSITE was used to calculate a normalized
volume distance Dm, deﬁned as DVD, E (VT— VQ)2/(VTVQ)1/2.

2.4 Datasets

(i) Random Set] (RS1). This set, composed of 5371 non-redundant
single-chain protein structures up to 250 AAs each, is the primary
random background for statistical signiﬁcance analysis. Proteins in this
set are culled at 35% global sequence identity. We applied CAVITATOR
and LIGSITE separately to each structure in this set, and consider only
the top pocket with the largest volume. We discarded pockets with 10 or
fewer residues. This procedure yields 5016 pockets by CAVITATOR and
3401 pockets by LIGSITE. The latter has fewer pockets because it uses
more stringent criteria to deﬁne a pocket. All-against-all pocket compari-
sons were conducted with APoc. We deﬁne a random pair of pockets if:
(i) their global protein structures have low global structural similarity at a
TM-score< 0.4 (normalized by the smaller protein) (Zhang and Skolnick,
2004) and (ii) <40% of the pocket residues are covered in the global
structural alignment. This deﬁnition yields about 8.2 and 2.7 million
random pairs of pockets by CAVITATOR and LIGSITE, respectively.
The CAVITATOR random set is used to ﬁt constants in formulas of the
PS-score and parameters for the statistical models (see below). The
LIGSITE dataset is reserved for testing purposes.

(ii) Random Set2 (RS2). This set consists of ~140 000 randomly
selected pairs of ligand-contacting pockets detected by LPC on holo-
protein structures from the PDB. The dataset is curated from 81756
entries in the PDB (May 2012 release). We consider small-molecule lig-
ands that have at least six and fewer than 200 heavy atoms and do not

include polypeptides or polynucleotides. This gives 37 325 PDB entries
with at least one such ligand. In the PDB, each type of ligand is repre-
sented by a unique three-letter name known as the HET code. If one PDB
entry contains multiple ligands with an identical HET code, we arbitrarily
select the ligand making the most contacts with the protein. The primary
protein chain that a ligand associates with is clustered at 90% sequence
identity. In each cluster, we subsequently select a representative for each
type of ligand, using X-ray structure resolution and number of contacts
as the selection criteria. This procedure gives 10645 types of ligands
associated with 26 999 protein chains. The binding pocket of each
ligand is obtained from LPC. All-against-all calculations of their pairwise
Tanimoto coefficient (Tc) were conducted for all these ligands, using the
1024-bit version of Daylight ﬁngerprints. We then randomly draw
200 000 pairs of pockets, each satisfying these conditions:

a Tc< 0.25 between the two ligands,

0 Sequence similarity< 30% between the two associated proteins,
0 Length of pockets> 10 AAs,

a Pocket length difference< 5%.

Following selection, to exclude globally similar protein structures, we
further compare the global structural similarity of these protein chains
and remove pairs whose global TM-score>0.35. The ﬁnal dataset con-
sists of 143 735 randomly selected, observed ligand-binding pockets from
hole-structures.

(iii) Bench Subject/Control Sets. Two sets are used to benchmark the
performance of APoc. Complete linkage clustering was ﬁrst conducted on
unique ligands curated from the PDB (see above) at a Tc threshold of 0.5,
which indicates a high level chemical similarity (the mean/sd of Tc is 0.16 /
0.12 among all ligands in the PDB). In each cluster, the ligand type most
found frequently in the pockets of protein chains curated at 90% se-
quence identity is selected as the cluster representative, e.g. ADP repre-
sents a cluster of ligands including AMP, ATP, etc. Within each cluster,
we used a graph-based algorithm, SIMCOMP (Hattori et al., 2010), to
obtain the equivalence between heavy atoms of each pair of ligands. We
collect atomic contacts between heavy atoms of the ligand and protein.
Two ligandiprotein contacts from two separate structures are of the same
type if the ligand atoms are mapped each other in the SIMCOMP align-
ment and the protein residues belong to the same group deﬁned above for
Equation 4. We then deﬁne the Subject set as pairs of pockets such that:

o Ligands found in these two pockets have a Tc 3 0.5,
0 Sequence similarity< 30% between the two associated proteins,

a They share 3 50 atomic ligandiprotein contacts of same type.

In total, we found 38066 pairs of pockets for the Subject set. We
expect that a signiﬁcant number of entries in this set share a high level
of pocket similarity because they recognize the same or similar types of
ligands and likely possess a putative common anchor region due to the
overlap of a large number of ligand-pocket contacts (Brylinski and
Skolnick, 2009). Note that no geometric information is explicitly used
in this procedure.

For the control set, we randomly selected the same number of pairs of
pockets as in the subject set satisfying,

a Ligands found in these two pockets have a Tc<0.25,
0 Sequence similarity< 30% between the two proteins,
a The global TM-score<0.5.

The Subject and Control set contain pockets from 2090 and 21660
unique protein chains from the PDB, respectively. Two ways of pocket
detection were used to obtain observed and predicted pockets, respect-
ively. Observed pockets are given by LPC, and predicted pockets are
generated by LIGSITE. In case of predicted pockets, we consider

successful pocket prediction as one that contains at least 80% of
ligand-contact protein residues found by LPC. About 75% of LPC pock-
ets are successfully predicted by LIGSITE.

2.5 Statistical signiﬁcance

The statistical signiﬁcance of the PS-score is estimated by comparing
millions of randomly selected pocket pairs (see Dataset). Figure 2
shows the mean of the PS-scores on three sets of protein pockets gener-
ated by applying three independent pocket detection methods. In each
set, we ﬁrst consider pockets of similar length, i.e. the length of the tem-
plate within 5% of the length of the query. Pockets of arbitrary lengths
are considered next. The constants of the scaling factor deﬁned in
Equation 1 were obtained by ﬁtting the un-scaled PS-scores calculated
using Equation 2, such that the ﬁnal PS-scores are approximately
length-independent for random pockets of similar length. The constants
were obtained on pockets found by CAVITATOR on RS1, and are fur-
ther validated on other two sets of pockets detected by two independent
pocket-detection methods, LIGSITE and LPC on RS1 and RS2, respect-
ively. As shown in Figure 2, the mean PS-scores in the validation tests are
similar to those of scores on the training set, which have a mean score of
0.308. The statistical signiﬁcance of the PS-scores for pockets of similar
length can be empirically estimated and are provided in Table 1. A
PS-score of 0.4 is significant at P< 1x10T3. By comparison, the standard
TM-score, which is designed as a length-independent metric for compar-
ing protein global structures, varies dramatically from 0.16 to 0.40 when
applied to the pockets (Fig. 2). As such, the TM-score is not ideal for
measuring pocket similarity.

Since the PS-scores are maxima, the extreme value distribution is a
suitable statistical model for describing their distribution. In general, for
pockets of arbitrary size, the PS-scores of pockets may be modelled using
the type I extreme value distribution (Gumbel distribution),

The scores from random pockets were ﬁt to Equation 5.
Supplementary Fig. S1 shows the observed and modelled distributions
at various lengths. Each distribution is modelled by the Gumbel distri-
bution described in Equation 5. The location and scale parameters can be
estimated through linear regression ﬁts,

The parameters a to f were obtained by linear ﬁtting to the location
and scale parameters, which were obtained through maximum likelihood
estimates with the EVD package in the statistical platform R (http://
www.r-project.org/). The values of parameter a to f are 0.3117, 0.0277,
—0.029, 0.0366, 0.0025, —0.0084, respectively. In our implementation,
APoc reports the P-value of the score normalized by the smaller of two
pockets subjected to comparison.

2.6 Performance analysis

Given a threshold for a similarity score, if the score of a pair of pockets
from the subject set is greater than the threshold, it is a true positive (TP),
otherwise, it is a false negative (FN). Similarly, if the score of a pair of
pockets from the control set is less than the threshold value, it deﬁnes a
true negative (TN); otherwise, it is a false positive (FP). Sensitivity is
given by TP/(TP+FN), and the false positive rate (FPR) is given by
FP/(TN+FP).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Benchmark

We created two datasets, Subject/Control (see Section 2), for
evaluating the performance of APoc. The Subject set contains
38066 pairs of pockets from proteins at low sequence iden-
tity<30%. In each pair, pockets contain the same or similar
type of ligands at Tc 3 0.5; they likely share signiﬁcant structural
similarity because of the overlap of many atomic ligandiprotein
contacts of similar chemical type. To reduce bias, no pocket
structural information was explicitly used to generate this set.
As a random background, the Control set contains the same
number pairs of pockets that interact with dissimilar ligands
(Tc<0.25) in randomly selected proteins with low sequence or
global structural similarity. Observed and predicted pockets in
structures from the Subject/Control sets were obtained by apply-
ing two separate methods, LPC and LIGSITE. The former
method deﬁnes an observed pocket as being composed of residues
in contact with a ligand, whereas the latter outputs the predicted
pocket through a geometric analysis of protein structure without
using any information about the ligand.

As shown in Figure 3A, the majority (58%) of the observed
pockets in the Subject set have signiﬁcant pocket similarity as
evaluated by a PS-score at P<0.05, 47% at P< 0.01 and 33% at
P<0.001. By contrast, the corresponding percentage for the
Control set is 2.4% at P<0.05, 0.51% at P<0.01 and 0.12%
at P<0.001. Similarly, the results of APoc on predicted pockets
are 49% at P<0.05, 36% at P<0.01 and 24% at P<0.001 for

the Subject set, versus 2.3% at P<0.05, 0.36% at P<0.01 and
0.06% at P<0.001 for the Control set. Overall, APoc found
somewhat fewer signiﬁcant hits on predicted pockets than on
the observed pockets in the Subject set. This is expected because
the observed pockets are more accurate by taking advantage of
the structural information of the ligands, whereas the predicted
pockets often contain additional residues surrounding those
ligand-contacting residues, which introduce more structural vari-
ations, thereby reducing pocket similarity.

The performance of APoc is further displayed in the Receiver
Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves (Fig. 3B), which is
obtained by varying the PS-score P—Value. The sensitivity is the
fraction of pairs in Subject above a P threshold, and the FPR is
the fraction of pairs in Control above the same P threshold.
Thus, the curve shows how well APoc detects relationship be-
tween pockets that bind to similar ligands through structural

observed pockets. Similarly, the corresponding sensitivity values
are 56% and 43% for the predicted pockets. By comparison, a
global structural comparison method, TM-align, only ﬁnds 38%
and 27% pairs in the Subject set at a FPR of 5% and 1%, using
the global TM-score as the similarity measure; these results are
considerably lower than APoc. Figure 3 also shows that struc-
tural-based comparison performs much better than the
volume-based metric D,,,,, which gives a sensitivity value of
6.6% at an FPR of 5% and is only slightly better than a
random prediction. This is expected because the volume-based
metric is non-speciﬁc. Overall, the analysis suggests that the local
structural comparison approach, APoc, can categorize/predict
related pockets that recognize same/similar ligands from a
large random background. Such relationships may be weak or
undetectable by global structural comparison.

3.2 Examples

To further demonstrate the usefulness of APoc, we present two
interesting examples from the benchmark set. The ﬁrst example
involves the GTP-binding pockets in two GTPases, PAB0955
(Gras et al., 2007) from archaeal Pyrococcus abyssi and quH
GTPase (Sudhamsu et al., 2008) from bacterial Geobacillus
stearothermophilus (Fig. 4A). In each case, the GTP-binding
pocket is formed primarily by two motifs: G1 is located in the
‘P—loop’ that coordinates the interaction with the phosphate
groups of GDP, and G4 interacts and stabilizes the guanine
and the ribose moieties of GDP. In most GTPases, like
PAB0955, the motif G4 follows G1 in their sequential order.

 

PS-score = 0.58, P = 2.? M0“,
RMSD = 1.1 A, gTM-sccre = 0.34

PS-score = 0.46, P = 2.0 x104,
RMSD = 2.5 A, gTM-score = 0.36

Fig. 4. Examples of similar pockets from proteins having different global topology and/or fold. (A) A GTP-binding pocket in a GTPase PAB0955 from
Pnbyssi (PDB code: 1yr8, chain A, green) versus a GDP-binding pocket in quH GTPase from G.stearothermophilus (PDB code: 3ec1, chain A, purple).
(B) An ATP-binding pocket in a bifunctional glutathionylspermidine synthetase/amidase from Ecoli (PDB code: 2io7, chain B, green) versus an
ATP-binding pocket in an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase from A.baumannii (PDB code: 4ej7, chain B, purple). In each snapshot, the two protein
structures are shown in green/purple cartoon representations, and the corresponding bound ligands are shown in cyan/red licorice representations,
respectively. For clarity, pocket/non-pocket regions are shown in solid/transparent colours, respectively. Aligned pocket Cot atoms are shown as spheres.
Molecular images were created with VMD (Humphrey et al., 1996). The global structural similarity measured by TM-score is denoted as ‘gTM-score’

However, in an atypical GTPase quH, a circular permutation
ﬂipped the order of G1 and G4, such that a sequence
order-dependent alignment method only returns an alignment
for half of the pocket. The sequence order-independent feature
of APoc yields the full alignment of both motifs and returns a
highly signiﬁcant PS-score of 0.58 at P=2.7 x 10‘6, versus a
much lower PS-score of 0.40 if one only allows a sequential
alignment.

The second example is about two ATP-binding enzymes, a
bifunctional glutathionylspermidine synthetase/amidase GspS
(Pai et al., 2006) from Escherichia coli, and an aminoglycoside
phosphotransferase AphAl from Acinetobacter baumannii
(Fig. 4B). The ATP-binding pocket of GspS is located in the
C-terminal domain, with a structural fold similar to human
glutathione synthetase, whereas the ATP-binding pocket of
AphAl sits in a structural fold similar to the catalytic domain
of a protein kinase. These are different structural folds according
to the SCOP (Hubbard et al., 1998). The global structural simi-
larity is low, with a TM-score of 0.36 between these two struc-
tures. However, their ATP-binding pockets exhibit signiﬁcant
structural similarity as detected by APoc, yielding a PS-score
of 0.46 at P=2.0x 104, versus an insigniﬁcant PS-score of
0.29 in the sequential alignment. The overall RMSD of aligned
pocket Cot atoms is 2.5

3.3 Comparison with SiteEngine

SiteEngine (Shulman-Peleg et al., 2004) is one of few pocket-
comparison methods that can be freely downloaded for
large-scale benchmark testing. We randomly selected 1000/1000
pairs of pockets from the Subject/ Control sets, and performed a
comparison with APoc. As shown in the ROC curves (Fig. 5),
APoc shows considerably better performance than SiteEngine.
APoc achieves a sensitivity of 62% at an FPR of 5%, versus a
mere 17% sensitivity for SiteEngine at the same FPR. This
apparently surprising result for SiteEngine is mainly due to the
size dependence of the Match score defined by SiteEngine to

Fig. 5. APoc versus SiteEngine. The ROC curves of SiteEngine were
obtained by varying the threshold values on the Match score. The two
red curves are on the full set of 2000 pairs of pockets, and on a subset of
pockets possessing 45—65 pseudocentres, respectively

measure the similarity of ligand-binding pockets. The Match
score is a simple linear normalization obtained by dividing the
raw score by the raw score of the query against itself. This is not
sufﬁcient to correct for the size dependence because of the
non-linear relationship between the similarity score and the size
of the pocket. As a result, SiteEngine Match scores of randomly
selected pockets are strongly correlated with the size of the
pocket, yielding a Pearson Correlation Coefﬁcient of —0.60. If
we restrict the comparison to a narrow range of pocket sizes
between 45 and 65 pseudocentres, the sensitivity at a 5% FPR
jumps from 17 to 50% (Fig. 5). Thus, if the size dependence issue
were addressed, we expect that the performance of SiteEngine
would be dramatically improved. Another advantage of APoc is
its computing efﬁciency, due to the reduced representation
adopted by APoc relative to SiteEngine. On the same computing
cluster composed of AMD 2.4GHz Opteron CPUs, the total
computation time (not including input ﬁle preparation) for
these 2000 comparisons is 8983 seconds with SiteEngine, versus
73 seconds for pocket comparison alone and 3686 seconds for
both pocket and global structure comparison with APoc.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

Depending on the method one uses, there are two main ways of
detecting protein pockets. The ﬁrst is simply to collect all amino
acids that make direct physical contact to a ligand as observed in
a holo crystal structure. This practice is common in studies that
study the evolutionary relationships of protein pockets. The
second way is to perform geometric/physico-chemical/evolution-
ary analysis on the protein structure to predict pocket-lining resi-
dues without the presence of ligand. Using a putative pocket as a
query to scan of a template library, one may further infer ligands
that bind to the query through similarity to pockets for known
ligands.

In this work, we present a structural comparison approach
APoc that can be applied to pockets from both observed and
predicted pockets. A scoring function for measuring pocket simi-
larity is carefully devised, the PS-score, such that it can deal with
pockets of different size, ranging from 10 residues to 100 residues
(Fig. 1). In addition, the statistical signiﬁcance of the PS-score is
estimated from the extreme value distributions modelled on mil-
lions of random comparisons. This should greatly facilitate the
identiﬁcation of interesting relationships from large-scale pocket
comparison.

It should be noted that that there is no perfect scoring function
for measuring pocket similarity. Our PS-score is largely based on
the positions of Ca and CB atoms, as well as some consideration
of chemical similarity. This design is less sensitive to the con-
formational changes than a scoring scheme that considers all
heavy atoms, and it can readily detect the structural similarity
of pockets in remotely related proteins that share no apparent
sequence similarity but recognize similar ligands.

To evaluate the performance of APoc, we curated two
datasets: Subject and Control. The former is composed of pock-
ets recognizing similar ligands from proteins with low/no se-
quence similarity, and the latter consists of pockets binding to
chemically different ligands. In the benchmark tests, APoc de-
tects 62%/56% of pairs in the Subject set at a 5% FPR for both
observed (those that actually bind ligands) and predicted

pockets, respectively. These results suggest that APoc is robust to
pockets identiﬁed by different pocket-detection methods.
Furthermore, the two examples presented here illustrate that
usefulness of the sequence order-independence feature of APoc.
One example involves two GTPases, one of which exhibits a
circular permutation that changes the order of the active site
residues; the other involves a pair of ATP-binding pockets
from two protein folds. Such cases are challenging for global
structural comparison approaches.

One major difﬁculty in predicting ligand binding through
pocket comparison is due to the fact that a ligand may recognize
pockets of different structural shapes (Kahraman et al., 2007) or
even physico-chemical environments (Kahraman et al., 2010). In
our Subject dataset, ~40% of pairs belong to these challenging
cases, and APoc did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant score for them. An
analysis of the ligand conformation distribution in our Subject
set shows that ligands from pocket pairs with a significant
PS-score at P<0.05 have a median RMSD of 1.68A, much
lower than the median of 3.05A from ligands in pocket pairs
at P30.05 (Supplementary Fig. S2). If we consider only the
cases whose ligand RMSD<2.5/2.0A, 81/90% of pairs have a
significant pocket similarity at P<0.05. In some cases, the plas-
ticity of pockets permits ligands with different conformations to
be accommodated, and yet maintains signiﬁcant pocket similar-
ity (an example is shown in Supplementary Fig. S3A). Some
ligands are composed of a common anchor segment, which is
recognized by Virtually the same pocket shape, and a long ﬂexible
segment, which gives a large ligand RMSD. But in most cases,
conformational changes in ligands are accompanied by consid-
erable changes in pockets, leading to little/ no structural similarity
(Supplementary Fig. S3B). Furthermore, in a few most challen-
ging cases, a ligand of the same conformation may interact with
structurally different pockets (Supplementary Fig. S3C).
Although certain fragments of pockets may still exhibit similarity
in these cases, the overall similarity level is not high enough to
distinguish them conﬁdently from the random background.

In ongoing work, we shall use APoc to characterize the struc-
tural similarity of all pockets in the PDB. Of particular interest is
the examination of how many distinct pockets there are, how
often a given pocket is shared across proteins of different folds
and how coupled are pocket geometric similarity and ligand
chemical similarity and mode of binding. These issues are import-
ant for elucidating the promiscuity of small-molecule ligands that
may be endogenous (Viz. metabolites) or drugs. In that regard,
having a robust tool such as APoc will enable the user community
to apply similar ideas and studies as has been done for global
protein structures (Skolnick et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2006) or
proteiniprotein interfaces (Gao and Skolnick, 2010b) to the char-
acterization of the nature and similarity of protein pockets.

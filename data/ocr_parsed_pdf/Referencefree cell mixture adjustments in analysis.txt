ABSTRACT

Motivation: Recently there has been increasing interest in the effects
of cell mixture on the measurement of DNA methylation, specifically
the extent to which small perturbations in cell mixture proportions can
register as changes in DNA methylation. A recently published set of
statistical methods exploits this association to infer changes in cell
mixture proportions, and these methods are presently being applied
to adjust for cell mixture effect in the context of epigenome-wide as-
sociation studies. However, these adjustments require the existence
of reference datasets, which may be laborious or expensive to collect.
For some tissues such as placenta, saliva, adipose or tumor tissue, the
relevant underlying cell types may not be known.

Results: We propose a method for conducting epigenome-wide as-
sociation studies analysis when a reference dataset is unavailable,
including a bootstrap method for estimating standard errors. We dem-
onstrate via simulation study and several real data analyses that our
proposed method can perform as well as or better than methods that
make explicit use of reference datasets. In particular, it may adjust for
detailed cell type differences that may be unavailable even in existing
reference datasets.

Availability and implementation: Software is available in the R
package RefFreeEWAS. Data for three of four examples were
obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), accession numbers
GSE37008, GSE42861 and GSE30601, while reference data were

1 INTRODUCTION

Recently there has been increasing interest in the effects of cell
mixture on the measurement of DNA methylation, speciﬁcally
the extent to which small perturbations in cell mixture propor-
tions can register as changes in DNA methylation (Adalsteinsson
et al., 2012; Bock, 2012; Houseman et al., 2012; Lam et al., 2012;
Liu et al., 2013; Reinius et al., 2012). DNA methylation, tightly
associated with alterations in the nucleosome DNA scaffold (and
hence chromatin), is in part responsible for coordination of gene
expression in individual cells (Ji et al., 2011; Khavari et al., 2011;

Natoli, 2011). It is now appreciated that differentially methylated
DNA regions (DMRs) distinguish cell lineages with high sensi-
tivity and speciﬁcity (Baron et al., 2006), and considerable re-
search is now underway to delineate precise DMRs that deﬁne
and specify a particular cell lineage. A recently published set of
statistical methods exploits this association to infer changes in
cell mixture proportions solely on the basis of a DNA methyla-
tion profile (Houseman et al., 2012). These methods may broadly
be conceived as the projection of DNA methylation data from a
target dataset 51 onto a reference dataset SO consisting of DNA
methylation proﬁles for isolated cell types. For example, 51 may
consist of DNA methylation measured in whole blood from a
casewontrol study (Langevin et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2013;
Koestler et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013), while SO may consist
of corresponding DNA methylation profiles from isolated leuko-
cyte cell types (e. g. CD4+ leukocytes, B cell lymphocytes, gran-
ulocytes) as provided by Houseman et a]. (2012) and Reinius
et a]. (2012). Recently, some investigators have used these meth-
ods to adjust for cell mixture effect in the context of epigenome-
wide association studies (EWAS, Liu et al., 2013). However,
these adjustments require the existence of reference datasets S0,
and these sets may be laborious or expensive to collect. In add-
ition, for some tissues such as placenta, saliva, adipose or tumor
tissue, the relevant underlying cell types may not be known. In
this article, we propose a method for conducting EWAS analysis
when a reference dataset is unavailable, demonstrating that it can
perform as well as the methods that make explicit use of a ref-
erence dataset.

2 STATISTICAL METHODS

Our proposed method, closely related to surrogate variable ana-
lysis (SVA, Leek and Storey, 2007), relies on a simple projection
based on singular value decomposition (SVD), as does SVA. In
SVA, the residuals of a linear model are decomposed into a
factor-analytic structure and the factors are used subsequently
in a regression model, with iteration resulting in a ﬁnal set of
surrogate variables. Our approach, which does not require iter-
ation to obtain estimates, includes unadjusted linear coefﬁcient
estimates as columns of the matrix to be decomposed. As
we demonstrate later in the text, this construction associ-
ates the residuals of the unadjusted model with the unadjusted
coefﬁcient estimates in a manner consistent with a linear mixing
assumption.

We assume DNA methylation array results Y, an m x n
matrix representing DNA methylation measurements for m
CpG sites and n subjects. We assume that the measurements
are on a ‘beta value’ scale, having an interpretation as estimates
of the proportion of methylated molecules corresponding to a
given locus. In addition, we assume an n x 1) matrix X of covari-
ates, including an intercept (in the first column), the phenotype
of interest and potential confounders. The standard unadjusted
EWAS analysis (on beta values) posits the linear model

Y =B*XT+E* (1)

where B* is an m x 1) matrix of coefﬁcients and E* is an m x n
matrix of errors. Generally, analysis proceeds as if the rows of E*
were independent, although permutation-based inference is
sometimes used to account for potential correlation among
rows, and B* can sometimes include ‘surrogate variable’ con-
founders (Leek and Storey, 2007; Teschendorff et al., 2011)
that account for technical error. However, DNA methylation
effects may be mediated through covariate effects on cell mix-
tures, i.e. Q = XF + E andY = BXT + MQT + E, where Q is an
n x k matrix of subject-specific cell proportions for k cell types
(with rows summing to values 5 1), F is a p x k coefﬁcient
matrix representing cell-proportion effects, E is an n x k matrix
of errors, B is an m x 1) matrix of direct epigenetic effects (not
mediated by effects on cell type), M is an m x k matrix of cell-
speciﬁc mean methylation values (falling between 0 and 1) and E
is an m x n matrix of errors. The goal of an adjusted EWAS
analysis is to estimate the direct effects B. Note that M can be
obtained from reference data, but it is unknown if a reference
dataset does not exist. We explicitly posit a model on the beta-
Value scale because the effects are expected to be linear and addi-
tive only on this scale, not on the M-Value scale often used (Liu
et al., 2013). Substitution results in the following linear model:

Y = (B + MrT)xT + MET + E (2)

where it becomes evident that B* =B+Ml"T and
E* = ET+E. Although a naive analysis would treat the
error matrix E* as having independent rows, an alternative
model is to assume a factor-analytic structure on E* or E,
speciﬁcally

E=LUT+<I> (3)

where L is an m x q matrix of CpG-specific factor loadings, U is
an n x q matrix of latent effects and (I) is an m x n matrix of
‘uniqueness’ errors. This formulation is implicit in methods such
as SVA (Leek and Storey, 2007) and independent surrogate vari-
able analysis (ISVA, Teschendorff et al., 2011), which are tech-
niques proposed for addressing batch effects and confounders as
well as cell mixture effects, although neither SVA nor ISVA ex-
plicitly posits this structure. Substituting (2) in (3) results in the
following model:

Y = (B + MrT)XT + (M, L)(E, U)T + (I) (4)
which expresses the explicit dependence of the latent structure of
E* on the unknown cell-speciﬁc methylation matrix M. M ap-
pears twice in (4), once in the error structure, and once as a

random effect on X. The SVA method extracts latent subject-
speciﬁc effects using an SVD, which might also be used in this

formulation as well, as long as the double appearance of M can
be addressed. Careful inspection of (4) reveals that

(B*, E*) = (M, L)[(r, omf, (a, U)T] + (B, 0m) + (D
2 AUT + (B, 0qu) + (D

for somme x (k + 1]) matrix A = (M, 1:)Tand (k + q) x (p + n)
matrix U = [(F, 0pxq)T, (E, U)T], with U having at least q or-
thogonal columns. Although the k rows of the biologically deter-
mined matrix [FT, ET] need not be orthogonal, the products ME
and M1"T in (2) are not fully identiﬁed, in the sense that
M: = MAA’lE and Ml"T = MAA’ll"T for any invertible
k x k matrix A, including any that orthogonalizes the rows
ofT [FT,ET]; thus, it is possible to ﬁnd a fully orthogonal
U that still results in quantities that satisfy (2) and yield an
identiﬁable B.

Motivated by this observation, we propose applying an SVD
on (13*,E*) after fitting the unadjusted model (1); that is, we
compute the SVD of the matrix obtained from the unadjusted
model by concatenating the estimated coefﬁcient matrix with the
estimated residual matrix. Speciﬁcally, with dimension d fixed
(d 3 k + q), we ﬁnd m x d loading matrix A, (p + n) x d latent
variable matrix U and m x (p + n) uniqueness error matrix (I)
such that

(Biff) 2 AUT + ci>

and UTU = Id. This is easily achieved by selecting the first d
terms of the SVD of (13*,E*), i.e. the SVD terms corresponding
to the Ad* largest singplar values. Speciﬁcally, the SVD pro-
duces (B , E ) = LAU + L/A/U/T, where A is a diagonal d x d
mTatrix, A’ is a diagonal (p + n — d) x (p + n — d) matrix,
L L = U U = Id, L/TL/ = U/TU/ = Ip+nEd and every diagonal
element of A/ is less than every diagonal element of A; A is
thus obtained as LA. As M is a submatrix of A, we propose
the following estimator for B, obtained as the residual of the

projection of B* onto the column space of A:
B = B" — A(ATA)’1AT]3* (5)
For any non-singular d x d matrix D,
(AD)I(AD)T (A13)]’l(1\1))T = MATATIAT

so that (5) is independent of the scales chosen for each column of
A. Although it is impossible to distinguish M from L within A, L
has an interpretation that is identical with the surrogate variables
extracted by SVA, and that SVA would also be unable to distin-
guish M from L.

Although this estimator is motivated by an explicit statistical
model, its construction is somewhat ad hoc. Inference, there-
fore, demands an appropriate bootstrap estimate of coefﬁcient
standard errors. To adequately account for correlation in the
error structure, we propose the following approach. First,
B* = B + Ml"T represents all systematic variation (cell-mediated
and non-cell-mediated) and E* = MET + E represents all unex-
plained variation (in both cell composition and non-cell-
mediated variation), so that sampling with replacement from
the columns of E* should form the basis of the bootstrap.
However, the variance of the elements of E* will depend on
the corresponding elements of M* = B*XT, as the biologically

determined values are approximately beta-distributed.
[M* = E(Y|X) is a matrix of mean values p11,, not the cell-specific
methylation matrix M.] As the variance of a beta-distributed
variable with mean u scales by p(1 — p), we obtain a matrix
(:2: of mean-standardized errors by dividing each element e}; of
E *by [ﬁfiﬂ — ﬁ;)]1/2, where  is the corresponding element of

. Thus, we construct bootstrap sample Y“) as
Y“) = M* + E*("), where the elements of E*(") are obtained by
ﬁrst sampling with replacement from the columns of (2*, then
multiplying the result, element-wise, by the elements
[121:0 — 12;.)11/2 (of the un-resampled matrix). This standardiza-
tion approach preserves the relationship between the mean and
variance of a beta distribution, while sampling column-wise pre-
serves correlations across Cst. As shown in the Supplementary
Material, the latter property allows the bootstrap samples to
form the basis of an omnibus test of significance over the
entire array. Bootstrap estimates B*(") and B“) are thus obtained
by fitting (1) on Y“), and subsequently recomputing (5).
Standard errors for the elements of B are obtained by
calculating the corresponding standard deviations over boot-
strap samples B("), r e 1,...,R (with, e.g. R2250 or R2500).
Bootstrap-based standard errors for 13* can be obtained simply
by computing standard deviations from the bootstrap samples
obtained by ﬁtting (1) to the bootstrap samples Y“).

The proposed methods can easily be adapted to accommo-
date missing values in Y as follows: (i) rows of B* corres-
ponding to rows of Y having missing values can be estimated
on a row-by-row basis Via complete-case analysis; (ii) the
SVD producing L and U can be obtained from completely
observed rows of (B*,E*); A is then constructed from L for
completely observed rows, or else for rows with missing
values by projecting (B*,E*) onto U using a complete-case
regression analysis. The bootstrap procedure introduces miss-
ing values by sampling from replacement from the columns
of (2*, which will contain missing values for elements of Y
that are missing.

A remaining issue is appropriate selection of the dimension d.
Teschendorff et al. (2011) propose a method for estimating the
dimension of a latent surrogate variable using random matrix
theory (RMT); application of their algorithm to the matrix E*
is one simple approach for estimating d. The simulation studies
presented in the Supplementary Material suggest that this
method performs well. As shown in the Supplementary
Material, it outperforms a simple approach based on minimizing
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information
Criterion (BIC), and data analysis results suggest that it produces
estimates reasonably similar to those produced by the method
suggested by Buja and Eyuboglu (1992) and implemented in the
R package sva. In the case where E* possesses missing values,
only the completely observed rows are used.

Finally, we once again emphasize that the proposed method-
ology necessarily requires that analysis proceed on a linear
(ﬂ-Value) scale, because the logit-transform used to construct
M-Values destroys the linear mixing assumption. However, we
acknowledge that a substantial portion of error may occur on the
logit scale, owing to the fact that the individual probes used to
interrogate the molecular methylation states are expected to have
approximately lognormal distributions. We address this concern
in the next section.

3 SIMULATION STUDY

We conducted a simulation study to confirm that the proposed
methodology produces unbiased results. Simulation parameters
were chosen to produce datasets as similar as possible to realistic
DNA methylation datasets, although the dimensions were small
enough to make the simulation study feasible. Fixing m: 1000,
n: 250 and k: 4, we constructed m x k matrix M by selecting
each element of the first 250 rows of M as a Beta(0.25,0.25)
random variable, setting the remaining rows equal to zero;
thus, the first 250 rows of M correspond to Cst that are
DMRs for k: 4 cell types. M was held constant over all simu-
lations. The m x 2 matrix B was constructed as B 2 (BI, {52),
where 4' 6 {0,1} and B 2 (Bl, ﬁz) were generated (once for all
simulated datasets) from a 3-part mixture model as described
in the Supplementary Material, in such a way that non-zero
direct effects tended to occur only for Cst with mid-range
values, and their signs tended to correlate inversely with the
intercept. Details appear in the Supplementary Material
(Section I), but for each simulated dataset there were 30 negative
effects, 23 positive effects and 947 null effects. For each simu-
lated dataset, the phenotype of interest, x,- (i e {1,...,n}), was
generated as a U(—0.5,0.5) uniform random variable. Each
row of the cell proportion matrix Q was generated as
Dirichlet(E,-p), where the dispersion parameter p = 100 resulted
in biologically plausible variation in cell proportions for a speci-
men such as blood, a, = (0.2,0.1,0.1,0.6)T + r(0.05,
—0.05, 0, 0)Tx,-, and ‘L' e {0, 1} was a simulation parameter con-
trolling the strength of the phenotype effect on cell mixture.
Generation of the error component of the model was imple-
mented in a manner that allowed us to investigate the
effects of error on different scales, logit and linear. First, we
presume that biological variation occurs on the linear scale,
with error arising from a beta distribution. Thus, with
(p1,, ...,um,)T = u,- 2 51+ ﬁle- + ME), we generated beta-
distributed values bi]- ~ Beta([t,-jqj, (1 — [ll-j)qj), ﬂ],- = min{max
{ll/1'30}: 1}: (Ij = minfnil 2L1 ller — llji)/62 — 1: 1} and
6 = 0.008; in other words, we chose row-speciﬁc dispersion par-
ameters such that the average variance of bﬁ for row j over
i e {1, ...,n} was about 62. Simulations demonstrate relative in-
sensitivity to 6, as shown in Supplementary Material (Section IV;
Fig. S5(e)].

To obtain the measured methylation values, we added a micro-
array error of the factor-analytic form described by (3) but incor-
porated on a logit scale. Beta values yﬁ are typically constructed
as the ratiO yer/(yer + yer + 8), where yﬁM is the measurement
obtained from a probe designed to interrogate a methylated mol-
ecule, yﬁU is the measurement obtained from the corresponding
unmethylated probe and s B 0 is a small constant chosen in ad-
vance. A common assumption in microarray analysis is that
measurements such as yﬁM and yﬁU are lognormally distributed;
consequently, logit(yﬁ) Blog(yj,-M)—log(yﬁy) is normally dis-
tributed, and we expect the technical error introduced by the
microarray to occur on the logit scale. For a latent error com-
ponent on the logit (M-Value) scale of measurement, we set q = 2
and generated the elements of the n x q matrix U = (111, ..., u”) in
(3) as standard normal variables, while the corresponding L
matrix was generated as ZA, with the elements of the m x q
matrix Z generated as standard normal variables and

diag(A) = (0.25, 0.01)T. For the matrix (I) in (3), the elements of
each row j were simulated as N(0,aj2 , with
01.2 = 0.252 — diag(A2) (i.e. the standard deviation of each value
was 0.25, but the errors were correlated across Cst). Thus, with
microarray errors (I) = (¢j,-)ﬁ, the simulated value y],- for row j
and column i was generated as yﬁ = [1 + exp{log(bj,-)—
log(1 — bﬁ) + ¢j,-}]’l. Table 1 describes the combinations of
simulation parameters 4' e {0, 1} and ‘l.’ e {0, 1} used for each of
four scenarios used to investigate basic properties of proposed
estimator. Supplementary Figure S2(b) provides a clustering
heatmap displaying a typical dataset simulated under
scenario #1. In each simulation (except those conducted to com-
pare methods of dimension estimation), the RMT method of
Teschendorff et al. (2011) was used to estimate the latent
dimension.

The Supplementary Material describes additional simulations
used to investigate several speciﬁc issues, as well as providing
additional graphical results for the four main simulation scen-
arios reported here. Supplementary Material (Section III) reports
the effects of larger sample sizes (n = 500). Section IV describes a
simulation experiment designed to investigate the effect of differ-
ent scales of error variability on the accuracy of different meth-
ods of dimension estimation (both in estimating the dimension
itself and in the impact on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE)).
Section IV also provides a comparison of our proposed method-
ology with SVA. Section V describes a simulation experiment
designed to investigate power and Type I error. In every scenario
considered, we simulated 100 separate datasets, and for each
simulated dataset, we used 250 bootstrap samples for inference.

For simulation #1, Figure 1 compares slope estimates ﬁz
versus 52, the SVA-adjusted variant of ﬁz versus ﬁz and ﬁz versus
52, on each of the m: 1000 features. This figure demonstrates
that although we expect the naive unadjusted estimator to pro-
vide an unbiased estimator of the total effect 5;, its estimates of
direct effects are somewhat biased in comparison to our pro-
posed estimator 52, especially for the null slopes. It also demon-
strates that SVA produces biases similar to the unadjusted
analysis. This ﬁgure is consistent with Table 2, which reports
the total RMSE [e.g. the square root of the simulation average
of m’1  (ﬁj — ﬁj)2] for each of the four comparisons across
all four scenarios. Table 2 suggests similar behavior for null
direct effects when the cell mixture effect is non-null (simulation
# 3). When the mixture effect is null, ﬁz and ﬂ: estimate ﬁz with
about the same precision, as one would anticipate. Under

simulation scenario #1, for each of 1000 features, Figure 2
plots simulation SD versus median bootstrap estimate (across
100 simulations) of the direct effect estimator. The bootstrap
procedure appears tolerably unbiased, although our bootstrap
standard error estimator yields apparently inﬂated estimates
for some DMRs and a handful of non-DMR Cst having
non-null effect. The two very biased estimates result from inter-
cepts lying near the zero boundary for mean methylation p, re-
sulting in non-linear effects (because of truncation) for some
subjects having strongly negative values of x; in the
Supplementary Material we provide evidence that the bias de-
creases in larger samples (Section III). Table 2 reports the median
(over Cst) of the ratio of median bootstrap standard error
(over simulations) to simulation SD for all four scenarios, for
both 82 and [3; standard errors for the latter being computed
using the standard linear model theory approach. Although the
proposed bootstrap standard error methodology is imperfect, it

Median Estimated SE

Fig. 2. Simulation 1: bootstrap standard error by simulation standard
deviation for B2. To increase legibility of the plot, SE estimates for two
Cst producing extreme bias have been moved to the left, as indicated

appears to be as good as or better than the standard asymptotic
methods used to compute standard errors for unadjusted effect
estimates B . Supplementary Material (Section III) provides
plots similar to those provided in Figures 1 and 2 for simulation
scenarios #2, #3 and #4; they are consistent with the results and
interpretations given here.

The results of the simulation experiment described in Section
IV suggest that the RMT method of dimension estimation has
good accuracy in estimating the correct latent variable dimension
when the magnitude of the latent effects is sufﬁciently large rela-
tive to other error components, superior to simpler methods
based on AIC and BIC. RMT was able, in general, to estimate
the dimension correctly even though the errors were incorpo-
rated on different scales (linear beta and logit M-value). In add-
ition, the results suggest that when the microarray variation is
relatively large, the reference-free and SVA methods have about
the same level of error, presumably because the microarray error
swamps the biological error. However, when the microarray
error is smaller [but still consistent with realistic datasets, as
shown in Supplementary Fig. S2(a)], our proposed reference-
free method outperforms SVA, particular in estimating coefﬁ-
cients for DMRs; this latter phenomenon presumably occurs
because the cell-mixture property is explicitly used in supervising
the deconvolution. Section V describes a simulation experiment
to investigate power and Type I error, using a bootstrap-based
method for testing omnibus signiﬁcance. It suggests appropriate
Type I error control when ﬁz = 0, and reasonable power when
the effects of ﬁz are large enough.

4 DATA EXAMPLES

We demonstrate our proposed methodology on four datasets.
The first consists of Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450
BeadChip array data on which bisulﬁte-converted DNA from
whole blood was hybridized; the data were obtained from
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), Accession number
GSE42861, and consisted of n=689 subjects: 354 rheumatoid
arthritis patients (cases) and 335 normal controls, originally

published by Liu et al. (2013). Using the data available on
GEO, we obtained four different estimates for the difference in
DNA methylation measured on the beta scale between case and
control at 384410 autosomal Cst whose Inﬁnium probes con-
tained no single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and had no
SNP at a ﬂanking G site (‘non-SNP CpG sites’). In the
unadjusted analysis, we simply applied the limma procedure
(Smyth, 2004), with design matrix consisting of an intercept
and an indicator variable for case status. We then applied
the method of Houseman et al. (2012) to data from 387
CpG sites overlapping between non-SNP CpG sites on the
HumanMethylation450 and the 500 leukocyte differentially
methylated regions made available publicly to infer leukocyte
proportions (the full Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27
dataset is available on GEO, Accession number GSE39981); in
the reference-based analysis, we used limma to estimate case
control differences adjusted for leukocyte type by using five of
the six available types: B-cell, CD4+ T, CD8+T, granulocyte
and NK (monocyte proportions were dropped to avoid an ill-
conditioned design matrix). In the S VA-adjusted approach, we
used the R package S VA (version 3.6.0) both to compute the
dimension of the surrogate variables and to determine the sur-
rogate variables themselves. Using the method of Buja and
Eyuboglu (1992) implemented in sva, we found d = 53 surrogate
variables; after estimating the 53 surrogate variables, we adjusted
for them using limma in a manner similar to the previous ana-
lysis. Finally, we applied our proposed reference-free analysis,
with X equal to the same design matrix used in the unadjusted
analysis. In the latter analysis, the latent variable dimension was
estimated to be 37 by the RMT method of Teschendorff et al.
(2011); because simulations suggest accurate dimension estima-
tion by the RMT method, we used d = 37. 500 bootstrap samples
were used for inference. The DNA methylation dataset available
on GEO contains no missing values. Figure 3 shows volcano
plots of the arthritis case coefﬁcient for the three different ana-
lyses, demonstrating diminished signiﬁcant for both adjusted
analyses shown in the ﬁgure (reference-based and reference-
free). Interestingly, significance for the reference-free analysis is
diminished relative to the reference-based analysis, suggesting
that the six leukocyte types proﬁled by Houseman et al. (2012)
and available in GEO Accession GSE39981 may be insufﬁcient
for analysis of blood data. This interpretation is further rein-
forced by Figure 4, which shows reference-free coefﬁcient esti-
mates by their corresponding reference-based estimates; there is
general agreement between methods for coefﬁcients with larger
magnitude, except for a single CpG whose magnitude appears
larger by the reference-based method than by the reference-free
method; in general, for the relatively null Cst, the reference-
based method produces estimates of larger magnitude than the
reference-free method. Supplementary Material (Section VI) pro-
vides volcano and scatter plots similar to those shown in
Figures 3 and 4, but showing the SVA results. In addition,
Supplementary Figure S9 shows a comparison of RMSE be-
tween our reference-free approach and SVA, where the 500-
DMR reference-based analysis was used as a presumed gold
standard. In general, the SVA results were dissimilar from
both of the other adjusted analyses, with greater signiﬁcance
relative to both, and more similarity with the unadjusted ana-
lysis. This suggests inadequate adjustment by SVA. SVA results

large number of Cst for which q<0.1. Despite apparently
increased signiﬁcance shown in the volcano plot appearing in
the Supplementary Material, the SVA-adjusted approach pro-
duced a higher value of no and fewer Cst (though still a

substantial number) for which q < 0.1. The reference-free analysis
produced a much higher estimated value of no and no Cst for
which q<0.1. Although there were no significant q—values after
reference-free adjustment, an omnibus test of significance pro-
posed in Section V of the Supplementary Material results in an
overall P<0.002 even after reference-free adjustment. As men-
tioned in Leek and Storey (2007), q—values can be misleading
when applied to multiple correlated tests.

A possible explanation for decreased signiﬁcance of the refer-
ence-free method relative to the other methods is that the refer-
ence-free approach led to less precise estimates. However, the
median ratio of reference-free to reference-based standard error
was 0.79, so that the reference-free approach led to estimates that
were apparently more precise, overall, than the reference-based
adjustment. Supplementary Material (Section VI) provides plots
comparing estimates and standard errors for the three different
methods. On the basis of these statistics and results, it appears
that the reference-free method more precisely estimates effects
that are smaller than those produced by the other two methods;
thus, inﬂation of standard errors is an inadequate explanation.
Another explanation for decreased signiﬁcance of the reference-
free method is that the reference-free approach potentially ac-
counts for many more cell types than either the reference-based
or reference-free approaches. The reference set provided by
Houseman et al. (2012) differentiates granulocytes from other
cell types, but does not differentiate neutrophils, basophils and
eosinophils within the granulocyte category; it distinguishes
CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells from other types of cells that are not
T cell lymphocytes, but does not differentiate T helper cells,
regulatory T cells or memory T cells. These types may be im-
portant differentiators of rheumatoid arthritis.

Our second analysis consists of array data for 92 independent
peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples, assayed
using the Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation27 (27K) tech-
nology, originally published in Lam et al. (2012) and available
in GEO, Accession number GSE37008. For the purposes of this
analysis, PBMC samples can be thought of as whole blood with
granulocytes removed. In addition to DNA methylation data,
complete blood count differential data were available for each
sample, thus providing gold standard estimates for the fraction

of the PBMC sample consisting of monocytes, assumed to be one
minus the fraction of lymphocytes. Using several different
approaches applied to the subset of autosomal Cst, we exam-
ined the association between DNA methylation and the loga-
rithm of il6 response to phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetatein (‘log
pma’), a potent cell division promoter. The ﬁrst analysis was
unadjusted; the second analysis was adjusted for monocyte frac-
tion; the third and fourth analyses were adjusted for blood cell
fractions estimated using the approach of Houseman et al.
(2012), similar to the approach described above, with the top
100 or 500 DMRs published in Houseman et al. (2012).
Koestler et al. (2013) provide a detailed study of the application
of reference-based estimates of cell proportion using this dataset.
In the ﬁfth approach, we adjusted for d = 11 surrogate variables
using SVA, with d obtained by the method of Buja and Eyuboglu
(1992). In the sixth approach, we applied the reference-free ap-
proach proposed in this article with d: 10, estimated via RMT.
Both the third and fourth approaches produced similar results,
and results reasonably similar to the second approach. The ref-
erence-free approach produced slightly increased signiﬁcance
over approaches 274. The SVA results were similar to the refer-
ence-free approach, although the resultant RMSE values were
larger for the SVA approach than for the reference-free ap-
proach, when monocyte-adjustment or reference-based adjust-
ment was used as a gold standard [Supplementary Fig. S10(o)].
The unadjusted analysis produced results that were substantially
more signiﬁcant than those produced by the other four
approaches. Details of this analysis appear in Section VII of
the Supplementary Material. In summary, our proposed refer-
ence-free approach produces results similar to (though slightly
less variable than) those produced by SVA, to reference-based
adjustments as well as adjustment by a known (though coarsely
differentiated) gold standard, but quite distinct from the un-
adjusted approach.

Our third analysis consists of 27K array data for 176 placenta
samples originally published in Banister et al. (2011). All n = 176
infants considered in this analysis were of gestational age greater
than 37 weeks. Data were adjusted for BeadChip effect using
ComBat (Johnson et al., 2007). Maternal-age adjusted differ-
ences in placental DNA methylation between 52 small-for-gesta-
tional age (SGA) infants and 124 normal infants at 21551
autosomal non-SNP CpG loci were estimated using three meth-
ods. In the unadjusted analysis, limma was used with design
matrix consisting of an intercept, an indicator variable for
SGA, and maternal age. In the S VA-adjusted analysis, we add-
itionally adjusted for d = 13 surrogate variables, with d obtained
by the method of Buja and Eyuboglu (1992). In the reference-free
analysis, we used our proposed method with d = 12 (estimated
via RMT). The volcano plots shown in Figure 5 suggest that the
SVA and reference-free analyses produce modestly diminished
significance compared with the unadjusted analysis. Figure 6
shows adjusted effect estimates by their corresponding un-
adjusted estimates and by SVA-adjusted estimates; the figure
suggests that a substantial fraction of Cst demonstrates
slightly larger effect magnitude when compared with their ad-
justed counterparts. As shown in Figures 5 and 6, as well as
Supplementary Material (Section VIII), SVA and the reference-
free methods produce almost identical results. In addition,
Table 3 suggests diminished significance of results in the

the effect of SGA on DNA methylation may be explained by cell
mixture, but that the mixture effect is substantially smaller than
that occurring for DNA methylation measured in blood.

Our ﬁnal analysis consisted of 27K data for 203 gastric tumors
and 94 gastric non-malignant samples, originally published by
Zouridis et al. (2012) and available in GEO, Accession number

autosomal Cst, we compared tumors to non-malignant sam-
ples. The first analysis was unadjusted; the second analysis was
adjusted for 27 surrogate variables (with d :27 determined by
the method of Buja and Eyuboglu, 1992); in the third, we applied
the reference-free approach proposed in this article, with d = 24,
obtained via RMT. In general, the unadjusted, SVA and refer-
ence-free approaches produced different results. The SVA and
reference-free approaches differed systematically (Wilcoxon

(Bracken et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2006; Schlesinger et al., 2007;
Squazzo et al., 2006), with the reference-free approach demon-
strating greater hypomethylation in tumors at PcG targets. Thus,
compared with the other approaches, the reference-free method
may demonstrate superiority in identifying biologically relevant
alterations of DNA methylation in highly heterogeneous tumor
samples. A summary of signiﬁcance appears in Table 3; details of
the analysis and graphical results appear in Supplementary
Material (Section IX).

5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

We have proposed a reference-free method of conducting EWAS
while adjusting for cell mixture. Following on work by
Houseman et al. (2012), this method posits a statistical model
that involves a latent variable representing mean methylation,
together with a factor-analytic error model consistent with the
surrogate variable approaches of Leek and Storey (2007) and
Teschendorff et al. (2011). We have also proposed a companion
bootstrap methodology for estimating standard errors.

Our simulation studies suggest that our proposed approach
returns reasonably unbiased estimates of the direct eﬁ’ect, i.e.
the effect not mediated by cell type, and reasonable standard
error estimates. They also suggest adequate control of Type I
error and reasonable power to detect direct effects of sufﬁcient
magnitude. Our simulations also suggest that the RMT method
of dimension estimation, proposed by Teschendorff et al. (2011),
performs well for estimating the dimension of the latent struc-
ture. Finally, our method performs about as well as surrogate
variable analysis (SVA) when technical error is of large magni-
tude, and better than SVA when technical error is of smaller (but
still realistic) magnitude. We have demonstrated our method on
four separate datasets. The first was a rheumatoid arthritis
dataset, where DNA methylation in blood shows substantial at-
tenuation in effect after applying our reference-free approach,
even in comparison to an approach similar to that used by Liu
et al. (2013), wherein DNA methylation was adjusted for cell
types proﬁled by Houseman et al. (2012) using methodology
proposed in that paper. A possible explanation is that DNA
methylation effects may be mediated by cell types not profiled
by Houseman et al. (2012). The second set consisted of PBMC
data and associated effects of il6 response to a potent tumor
promoter, for which we demonstrate that our proposed refer-
ence-free approach produces results similar to reference-based
approaches but dissimilar from an unadjusted analysis. The
third set was a placental dataset for which no reference data
were available for component cell types. In this dataset, effects
of SGA showed modest attenuation after applying our reference-
free method. This suggests that the effects of growth restriction
on DNA methylation are likely less mediated by changes in cell
distribution, a result that one might anticipate in a solid tissue
sample such as placental tissue. The fourth analysis compared
gastric tumors with non-malignant gastric tissue, showing differ-
ences in results between mixture-adjusted and unadjusted
analyses, but with signiﬁcant direct effects produced even in
the adjusted analyses. In this last example, there is evidence
that the results of the reference-free method may be more bio-
logically meaningful than those produced by SVA.

An interesting aspect of our methodology is its tendency
to produce ‘spikes’ in volcano plots, such as those shown in
Figure 5 or Supplementary Figure S12(a). These are caused by
shrinkage of standard errors, particularly at DMRs, i.e. Cst
that drive the cell mixtures in A. Because these Cst collectively
borrow statistical strength from each other, their standard
errors tend to be smaller. This phenomenon is evident in
Supplementary Figures S7(b) and S10(d), which compare refer-
ence-free and unadjusted standard errors for the blood and
PBMC datasets, respectively; these plots demonstrate that for
many known leukocyte DMRs, the standard errors in the refer-
ence-free method are noticeably smaller than the corresponding
standard errors from the unadjusted analysis. The same phenom-
enon is evident in Supplementary Figure S7(h), which plots the
standard errors from the reference-adjusted analysis against the
corresponding standard errors from the unadjusted analysis, and
demonstrates shrinkage of standard errors at leukocyte DMRs.

Unlike the SVA approaches of Leek and Storey (2007) and
Teschendorff et al. (2011), we posit a speciﬁc data generation
model that incorporates a factor-analytic structure that is impli-
cit in the previously published methods. However, we incorpor-
ate all CpG features in the factor-analytic structure, rather than
attempting to select a subset of features that are optimally in-
formative. While there may be some loss of precision in using all
CpG features present on a given array, we view this as an ac-
ceptable sacriﬁce to accommodate an agnostic approach that
permits any CpG to serve as a DMR. In addition, the surrogate
variables for which our model implicitly adjusts have an explicit
mixing interpretation. Our simulations suggest equivalent or
better results using our proposed method; the data analyses dem-
onstrate that our method can produce results that are similar to
SVA, as in the PBMC and placenta examples, or results that are
distinct, as in the arthritis and gastric tumor examples. In the
gastric tumor analysis, there is a suggestion that our reference-
free approach may produce results slightly more consistent with
known biology. The reference-free approach is able to do this
without the somewhat time-consuming comparison of candidate
surrogate variables with potential confounders; however, it
achieves this result by essentially projecting unadjusted effect
estimates on an error matrix, with a linearity assumption that,
while biologically motivated, may sometimes fail. In addition,
our method is designed to deconvolute cell mixtures; it is not
designed to uncover confounders that are speciﬁc to technical
sources of variation. Thus, SVA might be applied on an M-
value scale to extract surrogate variables that are speciﬁc only
for technical variation (i.e. by removing from the set of estimated
surrogate variables those that are associated with biological con-
founders) and are subsequently included in our reference-free
approach. However, it is somewhat unclear how to proceed
when batches are confounded with phenotypes; more detailed
research is needed to develop methods that adjust simultaneously
for linear mixing effects and non-linear technical effects, using
datasets having fully annotated technical data such as chip
number and position. However, we view this article as a concrete
step in that direction, and our data samples demonstrate the
practicality of our method.

Our approach now offers the possibility of conducting EWAS
analysis adjusting for mediation by cell type even without the
existence of reference datasets that may be expensive or infeasible

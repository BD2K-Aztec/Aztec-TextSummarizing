ABSTRACT

Summary: An application has been developed to help with the
creation and editing of Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML)
format metabolic networks up to the organism scale. Networks
are defined as a collection of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes (KEGG) LIGAND reactions with an optional associated
Enzyme Classification (EC) number for each reaction. Additional
custom reactions can be defined by the user. Reactions within the
network can be assigned flux constraints and compartmentalization
is supported for each reaction in addition to the support for reactions
that occur across compartment boundaries. Exported networks
are fully SBML L2V4 compatible with an optional L2V1 export for
compatibility with old versions of the COBRA toolbox.

Availability and implementation: The software runs in the free
Microsoft Access 2007T'V' Runtime (Microsoft Inc), which is included
with the installer and works on Windows XP SP2 or better.
Full source code is viewable in the full version of Access
2007 or 2010. Users must have a license to use the KEGG
LIGAND database (free academic licensing is available). Please go
to www.bioinformatics.leeds.ac.uk/~pytf/metnetmaker for software
download, help and tutorials.

1 INTRODUCTION

Flux-balance analysis (FBA), as described in Varma and Palsson
(1994), with an updated description in Kauffman et al. (2003) and
clariﬁed in a primer by Orth et al. (2010), seeks ﬂux solutions
corresponding to steady-state metabolite concentrations, S-v=0,
where S is the stoichiometric matrix of a reconstructed metabolic
network and v is a vector of the ﬂux through each reaction in
the network. Stoichiometric matrices typically have more reactions
(columns of S) than metabolites (rows of S) meaning that a solution
12 can be any linear combination of many vectors in the null
space of S. The linear combination of these vectors that gives
a single optimal vector can be found by linear programming;
often by maximizing the creation, in the correct proportions, of
the metabolites deﬁned in an experimentally measured biomass
function, or more generally maximizing or minimizing any other
chosen objective function. Additional constraints on the ﬂux through
certain reactions can be added—often with reference to known
uptake rates of carbon and nitrogen sources—providing a further
link between the computational model and experimental results. The
COBRA toolbox (Becker et al., 2007), which applies techniques

set out in Price et al. (2003), is a commonly used tool for FBA.
In addition to many other features, this software can perform
constraints-based FBA on Systems Biology Markup Language
(SBML; Hucka et al., 2008) format metabolic networks containing
additional information on reaction ﬂux contraints.

Many existing whole-organism metabolic network recon-
structions have been created using the Pathway Tools (Karp et al.,
2002) software based on the BioCyc pathway genome database
collection and the Metacyc compound/reaction/pathway naming
convention (Caspi, 2006). These reconstructions are often unsuitable
for FBA, since they contain holes due to a lack sufﬁcient manual
curation. Manipulation of these networks, such as adding new
transport reactions or adding/removing pathways, and quickly
exporting SBML format models is cumbersome and limits the
usefulness of the software for rapid network design and testing.

FBA-ready metabolic network models are generally recreated,
as outlined in Thiele and Palsson (2010). Recent examples of this
approach are for the pathogens: Leishmania major (Chavali et al.,
2008) and Salmonella typhimurium (Raghunathan et al., 2009) both
of which were built in SimphenyTM (Genomatica Inc.), a well
developed but closed source and expensive software package that
uses a custom compound/reaction naming convention.

2 THE METNETMAKER APPLICATION

MetNetMaker uses the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
(KEGG) LIGAND compound/reaction naming convention (Goto
et al., 2002) and provides a graphical interface dedicated to FBA-
ready metabolic network creation. The software is written in
Microsoft Access 2007 and uses Structured Query Language style
queries for database lookup and Visual Basic for Applications code
for the user interaction. The application structure and source code
is editable within the full version of Access, allowing users to
customize the software if necessary. ExcelTM (Microsoft Inc.) ﬁles
(*.xls) are used to save pathways during network development and
can be edited, and added to, outside of MetNetMaker, while still
retaining compatibility with the software.

The software has two main tabs for the user to interact with:
the Reaction Creator and the Reaction Picker. The Reaction Picker
contains a third key element of the application, the Selected
Reactions table, which can be opened in a separate window.
A diagram of the application structure, showing the role of each
application component, is shown in Figure l.

The Reaction Creator helps to create custom reactions, either those
not deﬁned in KEGG or special reactions such as biomass/obj ective
reactions, transport reactions (movement of a metabolite between
compartments) or boundary reactions (movement of a metabolite
between the model and an external metabolite pool), and adds them
to the reaction database. Custom reactions are deﬁned in terms

of KEGG compound IDs and are checked for similarity with the
existing reactions to avoid duplication. Special reactions have the
compartment of each metabolite deﬁned during creation, so that they
can occur across compartments within the ﬁnal model.

The Reaction Picker allows users to browse the reaction database
and select reactions using ﬁlters for Enzyme Classiﬁcation (EC)
number, pathway, reaction name or compounds involved in the
reaction. Filters can be applied in parallel to ﬁnd a precise reaction,
which is then added to the Selected Reactions table. A compartment
must be chosen for each standard reaction, and a single reaction
can exist in multiple compartments if required. Special reactions
are marked so that each metabolite occurs in the compartment it
was deﬁned in when the reaction was created. Optionally, the user
may specify ﬂux constraints through any reaction and mark any
number of reactions as objective functions. An EC number can also
be deﬁned for each reaction: either chosen from a suggested list
of EC numbers known to be associated with the reaction or taken
from the user input. Where a reaction is catalysed by an unknown
enzyme, the EC number can be marked as unknown and reactions
can be deﬁned as occurring spontaneously in a similar way.

The Selected Reactions table holds all the reactions in the current
network and reactions in this table can be edited or deleted until
the reactions are ready to be saved. Editable collections of reactions
are saved as ExcelTM (*.xls) format ﬁles and can later be reloaded
into the Selected Reactions table and joined to create a partial or
whole-organism metabolic network ready for export as an SBML
ﬁle. A further feature of the Selected Reactions table is that the
preferred direction of each reaction can be set by the user. Although

unimportant computationally (reactions are considered reversible
unless their ﬂux is constrained to zero in either direction), this allows
for easier visualization of networks in third-party SBML viewers and
allows MetNetMaker to create a list of dead-end compounds. Dead-
end compounds are those that are created but not used—or used
but not created—within a given compartment and strongly suggest
holes in the network or the lack of adequate special reactions.

In addition to model import/export, showing dead-end compounds
and application navigation, the MetNetMaker toolbar has two further
roles. First, it allows the import and export of custom reactions
and compounds that have been deﬁned using the Reaction Creator.
Second, it contains the controls to download and parse the KEGG
LIGAND database and to populate MetNetMaker’s central reaction
database with this parsed information. Help and video tutorials that
illustrate these uses are available on the MetNetMaker website.

3 SUMMARY

MetNetMaker helps in the creation and rapid manipulation of SBML
format metabolic networks with reactions and compounds deﬁned as
in the KEGG LIGAND database. It allows comprehensive ﬂux-rate
constraints to be added to individual reactions and helps the user add
the biomass/objective, transport and boundary reactions required for
network analysis using the COBRA toolbox. A built-in tool warns of
dead-end compounds within the network and helps the user create
custom reactions such as those required to join metabolism across
internal compartment divisions. The simplicity and narrow aim of
the software may make it more capable and easier to use for the
creation and manipulation of partial or whole-organism metabolic
networks than Pathway Tools. Because it uses the well-documented
compound/reaction deﬁnitions of the KEGG LIGAND database it
creates metabolic networks that are more portable and accessible
than those created in SimphenyTM.

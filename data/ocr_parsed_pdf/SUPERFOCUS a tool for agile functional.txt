Abstract

Summary: Analyzing the functional profile of a microbial community from unannotated shotgun
sequencing reads is one of the important goals in metagenomics. Functional profiling has valuable
applications in biological research because it identifies the abundances of the functional genes of
the organisms present in the original sample, answering the question what they can do. Currently,
available tools do not scale well with increasing data volumes, which is important because both
the number and lengths of the reads produced by sequencing platforms keep increasing. Here, we
introduce SUPER—FOCUS, SUbsystems Profile by databasE Reduction using FOCUS, an agile hom—
ology—based approach using a reduced reference database to report the subsystems present in
metagenomic datasets and profile their abundances. SUPER—FOCUS was tested with over 70 real
metagenomes, the results showing that it accurately predicts the subsystems present in the pro—
filed microbial communities, and is up to 1000 times faster than other tools.

Availability and implementation: SUPER—FOCUS was implemented in Python, and its source code
and the tool website are freely available at https://edwards.sdsu.edu/SUPERFOCUS.

1 Introduction

Prokaryotes and the Viruses that infect them are the most
abundant organisms on earth (Whitman et (11., 1998), and it is im—
portant to understand both who they are and what they are
doing. In many environments, the majority of the microbes can—
not be cultured by using standard laboratory techniques,
and metagenomics is the preferred way to study them as a
whole community (Handelsman, 2004). Next—generation DNA
sequencing (NGS) technologies have sped up the sequencing

process, reduced the cost, increased the sampling resolution and
opened new horizons in the biological sciences (Zhang et (11.,
2011).

Understanding microbial communities is important in many
areas of biology. For example, metagenomes can distinguish taxo—
nomic and functional signatures of microbes associated with
humans (Consortium, 2012), sponges (Trindade—Silva et (11., 2012,
2013), red seaweed (Oliveira et (11., 2012) and diseased and healthy
states of corals (Garcia et (11., 2013).

SUPER—FOCUS: A tool for agile functional analysis of shotgun metagenomic data 355

 

Functional annotation of metagenomic reads normally requires
the alignment of sequences to a large database of annotated se—
quences to identify homologs (Mendoza et (11., 2015). There are
many databases for annotations at the functional system or pathway
level, including the SEED (Overbeek et (11., 2005) which contains
subsystems (sets of protein families with a similar function), and the
large metabolic pathway databases KEGG (Kanehisa and Goto,
2000) and MetaCyc (Caspi et (11., 2010).

Many of the tools for functional profiling are slow (Lindgreen
et (11., 2015), suggesting that there is an opportunity for improve—
ments of these tools. Currently, available tools generally use either
homology, i.e. by aligning the metagenomic sequencing reads
against an annotated reference database, or use exact matches
(k—mers) to link metagenomic sequencing reads to the annotated se—
quences. Homology—based metagenome annotation tools programs
are still frequently based on pre—NGS algorithms such as BLAST
(Altschul et (11., 1997) or BLAT (Kent, 2002) to identify the best hit
in a large database, although new homology search algorithms such
RAPSearch2 (Zhao et (11., 2012) and DIAMOND (Buchfink et (11.,
2015) have recently been developed to reduce the run time. MG—
RAST (Meyer et (11., 2008) and MEGAN 5 (Mitra et (11., 2011) both
align sequences to a reference database to profile the metagenomic
sample. MG—RAST first predicts the open reading frames (ORFs) on
the metagenomic sequence using FragGeneScan (Rho et (11., 2010)
and then aligns the translated amino acid sequences to the M5NR
database via BLAT. MEGAN accepts as input the tabular results
files created from programs such as blastx/blastp, DIAMOND, or
RAPSearch2 to the NR database, and creates taxonomic and/0r
functional profiles based on the search output.

Exact match or k—mer based approaches use oligonucleotides to
identify the hits in a metagenome. For example, real time metage—
nomics (RTMg) (Edwards et (11., 2012) identifies all words of length
[2 (where k is typically between 7 and 12 amino acids) that are a
unique signature for a set of functionally related proteins, and uses
them to profile the functions present in the metagenomic sample.
This approach has also been successfully applied to assign taxo—
nomic labels to metagenomic sequences using a length of k of 31 nt
(Wood and Salzberg, 2014; Ounit et (11., 2015).

We developed a novel approach, named SUPER—FOCUS, which
classifies each sequence in the metagenome into a subsystem.
SUPER—FOCUS aligns all the input data against a reduced database
with contains only the subsystems present in the organisms in that
metagenome. The speed up derives from three improvements com—
pared with the standard metagenome annotation pipelines. First,
the SEED database was clustered using CD—HIT (Huang et (11.,
2010) using a similar approach as previously discussed and applied
to the Genbank NR database (Li et (11., 2012); second, the metage—
nomic query sequences are profiled using FOCUS (Silva et (11.,
2014), an ultra—fast tool that identifies the organisms in the meta—
genome; and finally, comparisons are performed using
RAPSearch2 which is ~2—3 times faster than BLAT and 100 times
faster than blastx, but has no reduction in sensitivity or specificity
when compared with BLAST (Berendzen et (11., 2012). We compare
the performance of SUPER—FOCUS to RTMg, MEGAN and MG—
RAST using different reduced databases and over 70 metagenomic
datasets of different sizes and from different environments. The re—
sults shows that SUPER—FOCUS speeds up the process of sequence
functional annotation 37, 60 and 1000 times faster than RTMg,
MEGAN and MG—RAST, respectively. We apply SUPER—FOCUS
to a novel dataset from a coral reef environment and show that the
taxonomy is conserved across islands while functions adapt to
local conditions.

2 Methods

The SUPER—FOCUS workﬂow consists of one pre—processing step
(step 0) and five processing computational stages which are repre—
sented in Fig. 1 and described below:

(0) Create reduced databases of subsystems using CD—HIT with
different parameters.

(1) Identify the genera present in the metagenomic sample using
FOCUS.

(2) Select subsystems present in the predicted organisms to create a
new reduced database.

(3) Align input data against the reduced database using
RAPSearch2 (default aligner), DIAMOND, 0r blastx.

(4) Parse the alignment output and keep best—hit(s) with, e.g. max—
imum E—value 1eT5, minimum 60% identity, and minimum
alignment length 15 amino acids (these are all default values
that can be changed). If more than one best hit is found per
query sequence, the program keeps all the subsystems for all
the best hits.

(5) Write functional annotations for subsystems levels 1—3.

2.1 Reduced reference dataset

The SEED database was developed by members of the Fellowship
for Interpretation of Genomes (FIG) and Argonne National
Laboratory starting in 2004 (Overbeek et (11., 2004) with the goal of
clustering sets of proteins which implement a specific biological pro—
cess or structural complex into subsystems.

The database is composed of subsystems structured into three
levels, the first level is the most general class and the third level is
the more specific class, and one functional role (Fig. 2 for an ex—
ample of one subsystem).

SUPER—FOCUS requires a group of reference sequences to iden—
tify the subsystems present in a metagenome. The proteins anno—
tated into 1290 subsystems (Supplementary Table S1) were
downloaded from the SEED servers (Aziz et (11., 2012) using the
SEED API (Disz et (11., 2010) on December 12, 2014 and all identical
proteins were removed. Next, the proteins within each subsystem
were clustered separately using CD—HIT in order to cluster exact
and nearly identical protein sequences (the clustering was repeated
four times with sequence identity cut—off: 100, 98, 95 and 90%)
reducing the total reference dataset, respectively, from 3.1 to 3 GB
(100% identity clustering; ~6% sequence reduction), 2.1 GB (98%

identity clustering; ~30% sequence reduction), 1.8 GB (95% iden—
tity clustering; ~40% sequence reduction) and 1.6 GB (90% identity
clustering; ~52% sequence reduction).

SUPER—FOCUS databases were named by the identity used in
their clustering e.gz DB_100 used 100% sequence identity, DB_98
(default database) used 98% identity, DB_95 used 95% identity,
and DB_90 used to 90% identity in clustering. Due to the reduction
of the reference database into non—redundant clusters, a slight loss
of functional resolution is lost. We recommend that the database
choice should be made depending on how specific the functional
profiling is needed. For example, if the function level is needed,
DB_100 is the recommended. Otherwise, the other databases can be
used with a little loss of sensitivity and high precision as shown
later.

2.2 Aligner choice

RAPSearch2 is the default aligner for SUPER—FOCUS because it has
a reduced memory requirement of ~2 GB RAM when running in
single threaded mode and around 3.5 GB when running in four—
thread mode.

DIAMOND (Buchfink et (11., 2015) has a large memory require—
ment of ~100 GB RAM for these datasets. Any aligner that provides
a tabular output can be easily integrated to the SUPER—FOCUS pipe—
line; e.g. BLAST, or DIAMOND which is ~20 times faster than
RAPSearch2 for large datasets but slower than blastx for small data—
sets. RAPSearch2 and DIAMOND have a fast version, which is less
sensitive, but 900 and 20 000 times faster than blastx, respectively.
SUPER—FOCUS was tested with both the fast and sensitive settings
for these algorithms.

2.3 The presence or absence of subsystems in

complete genomes

We downloaded all the encoded proteins in complete bacterial and
archael genomes, including any integrated phophages or plasmids,
from the Genbank database on March 12, 2015 (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.
gov/genomes/Bacteria). To identify the presence of SEED subsystems
within these genomes, we aligned the proteins to the complete SEED
database using blastp 2.2.25+ targeting the 250 top hits. Only the
best hit(s), i.e. those with the lowest E—value, were kept and used to
stipulate which subsystems were present in each genome (maximum
E—Value: 1e—5, minimum identity: 60%, minimum alignment length:
15 amino acids, and Supplementary Fig. S1 shows that the used hits
had 361.67 : 248.14 of alignment length, which suggests that
ORF’s were correctly assigned into a subsystem.

The presence of subsystems in each genus was determined via the
assignments of each subsystem at the species level (Supplementary
Table S2), and this presence/absence matrix is used to further reduce
the database in step 2 of SUPER—FOCUS pipeline.

We also annotated the same genomes using RAST (Aziz et (11.,
2008), and on Supplementary Material we show the comparison be—
tween the presence/absence matrices from RAST and blastp generate
a similar results.

2.4 Testing set
In order to evaluate SUPER—FOCUS performance, both public and
private real metagenomic datasets were selected as test cases:

Public data: Fifty datasets (2.2 GB) from six different human body
sites sequenced by the Human Microbiome Project (HMP)
(Consortium, 2012) were selected as a test case (Supplementary
Table S3) and three marine viral metagenomes (total of ~500 MB)
from the Moore Marine Phage/Virus Metagenomes project
(CAM_PRO]_BroadPhage) (Supplementary Table S4) were ana—
lyzed using SUPER—FOCUS. Human contamination was removed
from all the testing sets using DeconSeq (Schmieder and Edwards,
2011).

Private data:

Study sites: One big data metagenome was generated from a simu—
lated colon bioreactor, totaling 7.7 GB. Twenty coral metagenomics
samples were collected from February 2010 to September 2013
across the Central and Southern Pacific Ocean as part of the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coral
Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) monitoring program
(Supplementary Table S5).

Sample collection: Seawater was collected on coral reefs across the
Pacific Oceans as described in Haas et al. (2014). Brieﬂy, 2.2 l of
water was collected in diver—deployed Niskin bottles at ~10 m depth
within 30 cm of the benthos at each site. Sample water was then
ﬂushed through a 0.22 pm Sterivex filter. After filtration, excess
water was ﬂushed out of the Sterivex using a clean 10 ml syringe
filled with air. Sterivexes were then labeled and placed back into the
original package, sealed with tape and stored at —20°C until
extraction.

DNA extraction and sequencing: Total DNA was extracted from a
0.22 pm Sterivex filter using the Nucleospin Tissue Kit (Macherey—
Nagel, Dueren, Germany) following manufacturer’s protocol.
Brieﬂy, filters were thawed and excess water was removed by ﬂush—
ing the water out with 10 ml Lure—Lok syringe. One end of the filters
were sealed with Parafilm and 410 pl of T1 lysis buffer with 20 mg/
ml Proteinase K was added into each filter from the other end. The
end of the filters were sealed and placed into a 55°C oven on a rotat—
ing spit overnight. After incubation, 400 pl of Buffer B3 was added
to each filter and placed back in the rotating oven at 70°C for
30min. The lysate was retrieved from the filter using a 3 ml Lure—
Lok syringe and placed into a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Four
hundred twenty micrometer liters of 100% ethanol was added into
each tube containing the lysate and DNA was recovered described in
the manufacture’s protocol. DNA concentration was measured
using the Qubit High Sensitivity dsDNA kit (Life Technologies, NY)
and DNA purity was evaluated using NanoDrop (Thermo
Scientific). The Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina, CA)
was used for sequence library preparation and the manufactures
protocol was followed. In short, samples were diluted to 0.2 ng/ul

and a total of 1 ng of DNA from each sample was processed. DNA
was amplified via a limited—cycle PCR program, AMPure XP beads
(Beckman Coulter, CA) were used for purification and for size selec—
tion (> 500 bp) of the DNA. 11 samples were tested using the 2100
Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, CA) to ensure size selection was
successful. The size—selected samples were then sequenced on the
Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina, CA) using the MiSeq Reagent
Kit v3.

2.5 Sensitivity, precision and speed of SUPER—FOCUS
analysis

To benchmark our annotation pipeline with real metagenomes, we
had to define a true annotation of the metagenomic sequencing
reads. Because blastx searches the DNA sequences in protein space,
we consider it to be the most sensitive search tool, and we defined
the true annotation of a metagenomic sequencing read as the best
hit(s) of a blastx search of the read against the complete database
(DB_100), and if there is more than one best hit with an equally low
E—value, all are used. Thus, for a given functional level (e.g.
Subsystem level 1, 2 or 3), sensitivity is defined as the ratio between
the number of correct assignments by SUPER—FOCUS and the total
number of sequences annotated by a blastx search against DB_100
(‘true answer’), and precision is defined as the ratio between the
number of correct assignments by SUPER—FOCUS and the total
number of classified sequences by SUPER—FOCUS.

The speed of SUPER—FOCUS analysis, measured in thousands of
sequences analyzed per minute, was estimated by timing the run
time in seconds for each metagenome using the python library time,
and dividing the time by the total number of sequences in the meta—
genome; it estimates the number of seconds to align each sequence
in the metagenome against the target database (e.g. SEED or NR).

3 Results and discussion

3.1 Validation of clustered database and

SUPER—FOCUS evaluation

Prior to testing SUPER—FOCUS we independently validated our
database construction and size reduction. The HMP and viromes
testing set metagenomes were aligned against the SUPER—FOCUS
database DB_100 using blastx, as described in the methods, and
each query sequence was assigned to a subsystem using the SUPER—
FOCUS best—hit method. Next, DB_100 blastx’s assignments were
assumed to be the right answer, and same testing sets were aligned
against DB_100, DB_98, DB_95 and DB_90, but now using
RAPSearch2 as the aligner with the same parameters previously
used with blastx. RAPSearch2 was run with 24 threads in the sensi—
tive and fast modes using the SUPER—FOCUS workﬂow.
RAPSearch2 without the SUPER—FOCUS workﬂow using database
DB_100 represents how a regular user would profile a metagenomic
dataset only using the complete SEED and a fast aligner. This ana—
lysis was added to show that part of the loss of sensitivity and preci—
sion from SUPER—FOCUS profiling comes from RAPSearch2.

For the 50 HMP metagenomes with short reads, we measured
both the sensitivity (Fig. 3a for sensitivity using subsystem level 1
classification, Supplementary Fig. S2 for level 2 and 3 classifications)
and precision (Fig. 3b) for precision using subsystem level 1 classifi—
cations, Supplementary Fig. S3 for level 2 and 3 classifications.

We used blastx as our notion of ‘truth’ as it is the most widely
used algorithm in metagenomics analysis. For the 50 HMP metage—
nomes the average processing time (sequences/minute) is compared

with the sensitivity at each of the three subsystem levels. The more
sensitive the profile, the longer it is going to take, and the more
broader the categories (subsystems level 1), the more sensitive the re—
sults are.

Figure 3 also shows that the SUPER—FOCUS approach was
slightly faster, but less sensitive when compared with RAPSearch2
without the SUPER—FOCUS workﬂow alignments; it was faster be—
cause on average 88.53 i 5% of the 1290 subsystems in the SEED
database were used to profile all the metagenomes in the testing set
(Fig. 4) in step 2 of the SUPER—FOCUS pipeline, and the misclassi—
fied sequences explain the loss of sensitivity as described later.

Overall, there was <1% loss of sensitivity (Supplementary Fig.
S4a) and precision (Supplementary Fig. S4b) between all the levels,
which shows the efficiency of using the clustered database presented
in this paper and the SUPER—FOCUS approach compared with
blastx searches.

3.2 Understanding SUPER—FOCUS misclassifications

In order to understand the SUPER—FOCUS misclassifications when
compared with RAPSearch2 without the SUPER—FOCUS workﬂow,
two confusion matrices were generated to compare predicted and
real sequence annotations: Figure 5a presents the RAPSearch2—
Sensitive results using the DB_100, and the only significant loss of
sensitivity was 6.45% of sequences that were supposed to be classi—
fied into the ‘Plant cell walls and outer surfaces’ subsystems but
were not classified; this loss of sensitivity is explained because
RAPSearch2 is based on a reduced amino acid alphabet of 10

symbols, which makes the tools less sensitive, while blastx uses a
complete amino acid alphabet. Figure 5b shows the results for
SUPER—FOCUS—Sensitive using DB_100, and now 67.74% of the se—
quences that were supposed to be classified into the ‘Plant cell walls
and outer surfaces’ subsystems and 6.03% of the sequences that
were supposed to be classified into the ‘Photosynthesis’ subsystems
were not classified.

To investigate the SUPER—FOCUS misclassifications, those se—
quences were aligned against the NR—database using blastx and an
E—value cutoff of 1 eTS. The best—hit was selected for each sequence,
and the taxonomic classification for each hit was recovered using
Biopython (Cock et al., 2009).

The results show that ~25% of the wrong assignments were
from the Eukaryota and ~1.3% of the wrong assignments were
derived from viruses. The rest of the misclassified sequences were
associated with Bacteria. Ninety—nine percentage of those were not
identified by FOCUS and 78% were not identified by MetaPhlAn
because neither FOCUS nor MetaPhlAn include those bacteria in
their databases. Of the 22% that were identified by MetaPhlAn
(used to analyzed the data in the HMP paper) (Segata et 41]., 2012),
just over half of those (57%) had <2% relative abundance, suggest—
ing that both FOCUS and MetaPhlAn are missing the rare species in
the environment (Supplementary Table S6).

SUPER—FOCUS uses FOCUS in its pipeline, a tool that was de—
veloped to taxonomically profile microbial data. The FOCUS data—
base only contains bacterial and archaeal genomes, which explains
the misclassification of metagenomic reads from other microbial
clades. We showed that the real metagenomes used herein contained
viral and eukaryotic sequences, even after the sequences were

filtered. For example, while human contamination from the HMP
data was already removed using BMTagger (Rotmistrovsky and
Agarwala, 2011), we were still able to identify human reads with
the DeconSeq tool (Schmieder and Edwards, 2011). These contam—
inations affect biological conclusions (Weiss et al., 2014) and lead to
increased computing time.

SUPER—FOCUS was designed to only classify microbial data.
The SUPER—FOCUS pipeline guarantees a more accurate microbial
functional analysis and does not classify eukaryotic or viral se—
quences. Thus, if hits to the Eukaryotic and Viral Kingdoms are
ignored, the SUPER—FOCUS approach would present a better profile
than the one present in Fig. 3a as shown in Fig. 6 for sensitivity at
level 1, Supplementary Fig. S5a for level 2 and 4 (b) for level 3.

3.3 Comparison of SUPER—FOCUS with other tools
SUPER—FOCUS was compared with RTMg, MEGAN and MG—
RAST, and all the four tools were tested using default parameters.
MEGAN 5.10 and SUPER—FOCUS were run using default param—
eters and their default reference database, either online (MG—RAST
and RTMg) or using one core on a server with 24 processors X 6
cores Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU X5650 @ 2.67 GHz and 189 GB RAM.
MEGAN uses the NR database, and it was downloaded on January
22, 2015. MG—RAST uses the M5NR as database, and its last up—
date is not known because MG—RAST does not provide that infor—
mation. RTMg is a web server which uses the SEED as database and
was updated on November 8, 2013.

For the three viromes that were sequenced using 454 technology
and thus had longer reads, SUPER—FOCUS sensitivity and precision
were evaluated against the annotations based on the blastx searches
against DB_100 as the true assignments, and its runtime was com—
pared with MEGAN, MG—RAST and RTMg. Here, RAPSearchZ’s
performance was tested using different numbers of threads (24, 18,
12 and 6) (Supplementary Fig. S6), blastx was also used to align the
sequences because RAPSearch2 is known to be less sensitive for 454
data (Buchfink et al., 2015), and because DIAMOND was designed
for large datasets, and it is slower than blastx for small datasets.
RAPSearch2 is less sensitive for long sequences as shown in Fig. 7a.
SUPER—FOCUS had a high precision, using all the databases, of

Fig. 7. Classification sensitivity (a) and precision (b) percent using level 1 and
speed comparison of three viromes using RAPSearch2 and SUPER-FOCUS
using different databases and modes. blastx assignments using DBJOO were
considered to be the true answer

~98.4 : 1% using blastx with level 1 classifications (Fig. 7b).
Subsystems sensitivity and precision measurements for level 2 and 3
subsystem classifications are shown, respectively, in Supplementary
Figs S7 and S8. BLAST is slow, thus the blastx results for Fig. 7 was
generated in a cluster at the San Diego State University facilities, and
the run time was approximated based on the knowledge that
RAPSearch2 is N100 times faster than blastx.

In the timing tests, SUPER—FOCUS had the fastest profiling using
RAPSearch2 in its fast mode. RTMg was faster than RAPSearch2
sensitive (Fig. 8). MEGAN can be enhanced by using RAPSearch2,
and the underlying framework hinders MG—RAST.

Interestingly, despite the absence of phages in the FOCUS data—
base, SUPER—FOCUS was able to predict correctly the subsystems in
the viromes. We hypothesize that FOCUS predicted the microbial
host for the phages, and from those genera that carry the subsystems
present in the viral metagenomes. Phages are very diverse which
means that the subsystems associated with phages (‘Phages,
Prophages, Transposable elements, Plasmids’, ‘Virulence’ and
‘Virulence, Disease and Defense’), did not cluster well in the
SUPER—FOCUS database creation. This lack of clustering explains
why the sensitivity across different databases does not change much
in Fig. 7.

For the one big data metagenome analyzed here, the runtime of
SUPER—FOCUS was only compared with MEGAN, MG—RAST and
RTMg, and due to the large number of sequences (30917457
reads), DIAMOND was used as default aligner for the SUPER—
FOCUS and MEGAN tools. As shown in Fig. 9, SUPER—FOCUS
was the fastest tool followed by RTMg, MEGAN, and then MG—
RAST. It is important to point out that SUPER—FOCUS (and
MEGAN) used 24 threads, and even if the program had been set to
use less threads, it would be still expected to be faster than RTMg
because as shown in Fig. 8 SUPER—FOCUS is ~4.4 (most sensitive)

profiling was compared with MEGAN, RTMg and MG—RAST as
shown in Fig. 10, and the results show that the three tools are com—
parable to each other, except to MG—RAST which apparently over
predicted hits to the ‘Clustering—based subsystems’ and RTMg which
did not report any hits this subsystem as they are ignored.

3.4 Coral metagenomes functional profiling

Twenty coral metagenomes from four sites were also analysed to
test the robustness of using SUPER—FOCUS in the marine environ—
ment. First, the coral sequences were profiled using FOCUS, which
is part of SUPER—FOCUS, to understand the taxonomic profile
among the sites; and second, the same sequences were classified into
subsystems using SUPER—FOCUS with RAPSearch2 and DB_98 as
database which we have already shown to be sensitive and precise.
In addition to RAPSearch2, blastx was also added to the analysis be—
cause the sequenced reads average ~218 : 64.4 bp and RAPSearch2
is known to be less sensitive for reads longer than 100 bp (Buchfink

data between blastx and RAPSearch2 is shown in Fig. 11a. The me—
dian RAPSearch2 sensitivity was ~83%, although it was still precise
(~99%; Fig. 11b); in comparison, the median blastx sensitivity was
(~99.5%) and precision was (~99.5%) as shown in Fig. 9c and d.

hierarchical clustering based on the pairwise Euclidean distances of
the relative genus abundance of the each coral metagenome. The
clustering shows that the samples from the same site cluster to—
gether, which suggest they have a similar microbial community.

For the functional profiling, the same hierarchical clustering ap—
proach, using the distances between the relative abundances of the
level 1, 2 and 3 subsystem classification were used. Figure 12b also
shows that samples from the same sites had similar subsystem level
3 profiles (Supplementary Fig. S9 for levels 1 and 2). Both figures
show that there is a microbial core that is preserved on some of the
reefs; however, the nature of that core differs between taxonomy
and function, as we have shown before (Dinsdale et al., 2008). This
trend suggests that the organisms are quite stable at different sites
while the functions change to allow adaptation to local
environments.

3.5 Final considerations

FOCUS is integrated with a SUPER—FOCUS pipeline which permits
the tool to also report the taxonomic profile for a given metage—
nomic dataset. Both functional and taxonomic profiles are also pro—
vided by MEGAN and MG—RAST; RTMg only reports the
functional assignments. SUPER—FOCUS provides three advances in
the functional profiling compared with other tools: (i) It uses a fast
aligner; (ii) it uses clustered databases in order to obtain a fast pro—
file with little loss of sensitivity and (iii) focuses on the microbes pre—
sent in the input data to attain a more microbial profile. As a default

the tool, uses three advances; however, the user can select any com—
bination of options.

4 Conclusions

Here, we present SUPER—FOCUS, an agile solution to identify the
subsystems present in metagenomic samples that first determines the
taxonomic composition of the entire metagenome by using FOCUS,
and uses this knowledge to create, on the ﬂy, a reduced database
only containing the subsystems present in the organisms found. This
makes SUPER—FOCUS a faster and still accurate tool to profile the
functional subsystems in metagenomes. SUPER—FOCUS reports very
similar results to currently available tools, but does so faster and
using less memory.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Chemical named entity recognition is used to automat-
ically identify mentions to chemical compounds in text and is the basis
for more elaborate information extraction. However, only a small
number of applications are freely available to identify such mentions.
Particularly challenging and useful is the identification of International
Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) chemical compounds,
which due to the complex morphology of IUPAC names requires more
advanced techniques than that of brand names.

Results: We present CheNER, a tool for automated identification of
systematic IUPAC chemical mentions. We evaluated different systems
using an established literature corpus to show that CheNER has a
superior performance in identifying IUPAC names specifically, and
that it makes better use of computational resources.

1 INTRODUCTION

Automated NER (named entity recognition) of chemical com-
pounds is receiving increased attention from researchers because
it can facilitate the application of information extraction to the
pharmaceutical treatment of diseases and to understanding how
those compounds modulate gene/protein activities. Chemical
NER draws from the experience in performing gene and protein
NER (Smith, 2008), but differs from it in three ways.

First, catalogs of names and compositions of chemical com-
pounds have been traditionally less accessible. Fortunately, freely
available chemical databases such as PubChem (Li et al., 2010)
or DrugBank (Wishart et al., 2007) are helping to correct this
issue. This makes it possible to do NER of common drug names
such as ‘Aspirin’ or ‘Acetone’ by using a dictionary-based
approach.

Second, the complexities and the variability in the morpho-
logical structure of systematic IUPAC (International Union of
Pure and Applied Chemistry) chemical names (McNaught and
Wilkinson, 1997) make it impossible to create a finite dictionary
of such names. This poses the main challenge for NER of chem-
ical names (Vazquez et al., 2011). IUPAC names can be simple

words, or contain different punctuation marks, sequences of
numbers separated by commas and so forth. They can also be
combined in different forms (e.g. ‘18-br0m0-12-butyI-I I-chloro—
4,8—diethyl—5—hydr0xy-I5—meth0xy’), making it impossible to enu-
merate them all. This means that NER of such names cannot be
done using a dictionary matching, requiring alternative
approaches.

Third, systematic nomenclatures of chemicals, like IUPAC,
can be used directly to unambiguously derive their chemical
structure.

The number of applications that are freely available to do
NER of common and systematic names of chemical compounds
is still incipient, and their usability, efﬁciency and accuracy are
far from perfect. To help alleviate these problems, in this work
we present and benchmark CheNER, a machine learning appli-
cation based on conditional random fields (CRFs) that performs
NER of IUPAC chemical entities with improved performance
over comparable tools.

2 METHODS

CheNER uses linear CRFs to predict the locations of IUPAC entity
mentions in text. CRFs are a probabilistic framework for the labeling
or segmentation of sequential data (Lafferty et al., 2001).

The training and benchmarking of the application was done using the
corpora provided by Kolarik and Klinger (Klinger et al., 2008; Kolarik
et al., 2008). The corpora are divided into a training corpus (TrainC, 463
abstracts, 5072 annotated entities), a Medline test corpus with a small
number of entities (MedlineC, 1000 abstracts, 16S annotated entities) and
an evaluation corpus with a large number of entities (EvalC, 100 ab-
stracts, 1310 annotated entities). All corpora contain annotated chemical
entities written using the IUPAC nomenclature and other types of chem-
ical names. CheNER’s CRF was trained on TrainC. Its performance was
subsequently evaluated independently on both, MedlineC and EvalC.

In training our CRF, we deﬁned a set of features and tested different
combinations of them, together with two types of tokenization (A: by
spaces, B: by punctuation marks), different orders of CRF (1 or 2) and
different sizes of offsets conjunction or sliding windows (0,1), which cre-
ates a new additional feature of a token by conjoining its features with
those of the n (n = 0, n = 1) surrounding tokens. We then selected the best
combination, indicated by the highest F-score value obtained in cross-
validation over the training set, as a model to use in the evaluation. The
selected model performs with an F-score value of 80.20% (precision:
82.84%; recall: 77.74%), uses a second order CRF, an offset conjunction
of 1, tokenization type A and a particular set of features described in the
Supplementary Materials. To mark chemical mentions and establish bor-
ders between tokens during training, we used the ICE labeling scheme
(Vazquez et al., 2011). Details about the tested sets of features, training
and evaluation corpora, training process, modeling assumption,

3 RESULTS

3.1 Comparative performance for NER of chemical names

The predictive capability of CheNER for IUPAC names was
evaluated using the EvalC and the MedlineC corpora, perform-
ing the evaluation by comparing the system output with a gold
standard in terms of the precision (p), recall (r) and F-score (F).

There are, to our knowledge, only two other freely available
tools for chemical NER. These are ChemSpot (Rocktaschel
et al., 2012) and OSCAR4 (Jessop et al., 2011). To compare
CheNER’s performance with that of those tools, we use the
three applications to independently annotate MedlineC and
EvalC and compare the results. Our analysis shows that
CheNER outperforms the other two applications in the experi-
ments regarding IUPAC names alone (see Fig. 1) due to the fact
that it was trained specifically for them. Note that OSCAR4 and
ChemSpot do not differentiate between IUPAC and other types
of chemical entities and will detect entities that, albeit chemical,
will not be IUPAC and will register as false positives. To make
the three methods comparable, we ignore non-IUPAC entities
that are annotated in the corpora when evaluating performance.
Unfortunately the MedlineC corpus does not annotate non-
IUPAC entities, so this corpus can only be compared in terms
of recall. We ﬁnd that CheNER performs better than OSCAR4
and ChemSpot in identifying IUPAC names. Details are given in
Section 4 of Supplementary Materials.

Given that CheNER has been trained in the specialized task of
recognizing IUPAC names, it is not surprising that when applied
to non-IUPAC names it does not perform at the levels of other
systems (see Section 4 of Supplementary Materials).

3.2 Comparative use of computational resources

We also evaluated how efﬁciently ChemSpot, OSCAR4 and
CheNER use computing resources. We found that CheNER re-
quires less physical memory, running in computers that have
<3 GB of RAM, compared with minimum of 3 and 12GB of
RAM required by OSCAR4 and ChemSpot, respectively (see
Supplementary Figs S3 and S4 and Section 4 of the
Supplementary Materials for details).

4 DISCUSSION

Because IUPAC names are the standard in important types of
documents, such as patents, and the chemical structure is often
derivable from the mention itself, it is important to have an ap-
plication speciﬁcally devised for their identiﬁcation. Given the
potentially inﬁnite number of IUPAC entities, it is not feasible to
develop a dictionary-based approach to identify them, and nat-
ural language processing methods are more suitable to identify
those entities. Thus, we developed CheNER, an NER approach
for ﬁnding IUPAC names in text, using CRFs. We demonstrate
that CheNER annotates IUPAC names in documents with a
better F—score than ChemSpot and OSCAR4. CheNER is the
only tool that is speciﬁcally developed to identify only such
names, whereas ChemSpot and OSCAR4 do not differentiate
between entity types.

We also show that CheNER needs less memory and CPU than
the others to perform the same tasks. In addition, CheNER is
self-contained, requiring only that Java is installed to run, which
makes it easier to integrate in other systems.

Abstract

Motivation: One of the most promising applications of biosynthetic methods is to produce chem—
ical products of high value from the ready—made chemicals. To explore the biosynthetic potentials
of a chemical as a synthesis precursor, biosynthetic databases and related chemoinformatics tools
are urgently needed. In the present work, a web—based tool, BioSynther, is developed to explore
the biosynthetic potentials of precursor chemicals using BKM—react, Rhea, and more than 50 000 in—
house Raninder reactions manually curated. BioSynther allows researchers to explore biosyn—
thetic potentials, through so far known biochemical reactions, step by step interactively, which
could be used as a useful tool in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.

Availability and implementation: BioSynther is available at: http://www.lifemodules.org/

1 Introduction

Biosynthesis has important applications in producing bulk chemicals
(Hermann et (11., 2007; Shin et (11., 2013), biofuels (Atsumi et (11.,

2008; Lee et (11., 2008) or natural products (Paddon et (11., 2013). 2 methads

There are some biosynthesis informatics tools (Copeland et (11.,
2012; MacDonald et (11., 2011; Medema et (11., 2012; Mienda and
Shamsir, 2015; Moura et (11., 2013), such as BNICE (Hatzimanikatis
et (11., 2005), RetroPath (Carbonell et (11., 2011), DESHARKY
(Rodrigo et (11., 2008) and FMM (Chou et (11., 2009), to design bio—
synthesis pathways from a start molecule to a target molecule.

In industrial biotechnology applications, researchers usually plan
to get value—added chemicals from the ready—made molecules. That
is, how to automatically explore the biosynthetic potentials of sim—
ple chemical precursors? In the present work, BioSynther is de—
veloped to assist researchers to get comprehensive biosynthesis
target molecules based on the BKM—React reactions (Lang et (11.,

Data: The reaction data used in BioSynther is BKM—React (Lang et (11.,
2011), Rhea (Alcantara et (11., 2012) and in—house Raninder
Reactions. BioSynther contains all BKM—react reactions which inte—
grated Brenda, KEGG and MetaCyc reactions. However, the structure
information is not provided in BKM—react, so we have downloaded
from Brenda, KEGG, MetaCyc websites respectively and converted or
generated structure information into smiles format (Weininger, 1988).
That is, BioSynther contains 11 860 Brenda reactions, 9121 KEGG
Reactions, 13 416 MetaCyc reactions. We removed 8005 Rhea master
reactions (Alcantara et (11., 2012) from 32020 Rhea reactions, so
BioSynther contains 24015 rhea reactions. What’s more, BioSynther
contains more than 50 000 in—house Raninder reactions manually

curated from 120 000 scientific publications related to biosynthesis and
metabolism. We apply PubChem Compound database to unify com—
pound synonyms.

Algorithms: In our research, we need search reaction pathways
in a reaction network. The pathway search algorithm is a custom—
ized version of Dijkstra’s algorithm implemented in C++, which
was compiled to a dynamic library to be called by BioSynther web
server.

In BioSynther, user—customized pathway search engines are im—
plemented by removing some nodes and/0r edges to find the biosyn—
thesis pathways so that researchers can explore step by step
interactively.

Visualization: JavaScript library D3.js (http://d3js.0rg) is used
for manipulating web documents based on search data. Software
package RDKit (http://www.rdkit.0rg) is implemented in our web—
based chemical structure display system using chemical name or
smiles.

3 Results

In BioSynther, there are three different kinds of display view options to
explore biosynthetic potentials interactively. For example, after users
input a starting molecule, vanillin, three different view options (that is,
tree, circle or plain page) are available. Figure 1A displays the biosyn—
thetic potentials of vanillin, in which each node or edge is clickable.
When the computer mouse moves on a node, the related chemical
structure is shown on the computer screen. Each edge represents a bio—
synthetic reaction converting the starting molecule to a target molecule.

When an edge is clicked, the biosynthetic reactions of this edge are dis—
played with its original references.

In another view option such as Tree view, after users input ‘van—
illin’ as a biosynthesis precursor, eight possible chemicals in one re—
action step is retrieved. Each tree node is clickable to explore its
biosynthetic potentials according to researcher’s interest
interactively.

In order to explore the biosynthetic potentials of precursor
chemicals, a novel web—based tool, BioSynther, is developed using
BKM—react, Rhea, and in—house Raninder reactions. BioSynther
applies an interactive interface for researchers to explore biosyn—
thetic potentials step by step. BioSynther could be used as a useful
tool in metabolic engineering.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Metscape is a plug-in for Cytoscape, used to visualize
and interpret metabolomic data in the context of human metabolic
networks. We have developed a metabolite database by extracting
and integrating information from several public sources. By querying
this database, Metscape allows users to trace the connections
between metabolites and genes, visualize compound networks and
display compound structures as well as information for reactions,
enzymes, genes and pathways. Applying the pathway filter, users
can create subnetworks that consist of compounds and reactions
from a given pathway. Metscape allows users to upload experimental
data, and visualize and explore compound networks over time, or
experimental conditions. Color and size of the nodes are used to
visualize these dynamic changes. Metscape can display the entire
metabolic network or any of the pathway-specific networks that exist
in the database.

Availability: Metscape can be installed from within Cytoscape 2.6.x
under ‘Network and Attribute l/O’ category. For more information,
please visit http://metscape.ncibi.org/tryplugin.html

1 INTRODUCTION

Metabolomics is a rapidly emerging ﬁeld that is joining other
high-throughput omics, such as proteomics and transcriptional
proﬁling. It promises to be a powerful systems approach for
studying metabolic proﬁles pertinent to a variety of normal
and disease states. Transcriptional proﬁling and proteomics
have established data analysis tools; a metabolomics analytical
toolkit is yet to be developed. An important step in metabolomic
data analysis is examining experimental data in the context of
metabolic networks. A number of tools have been developed for the
interactive exploration of metabolic pathways (Okuda et al., 2008;

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Paley and Karp, 2006). Several databases describing human
metabolic networks have been published (KEGG, EHMN, HMDB).

Visual analysis has been shown to be effective in facilitating
human cognition in exploratory analysis with bioinformatics tools
(Mirel, 2009). Cytoscape is a highly popular J ava-based open source
software tool that is used by biomedical researchers to visualize and
dynamically analyze gene/protein interaction networks (Shannon
et al., 2003). Cytoscape is a powerﬁil stand-alone tool, but its
strength is even more apparent when it is coupled with databases.
A number of plug-ins (MiMI plug-in, Pathway Commons, etc.) have
been developed to interact with various databases.

Here we describe Metscape, a Cytoscape plug-in for visualizing
and interpreting metabolomic data in the context of human metabolic
networks.

2 OVERVIEW

2.1 The human metabolomic database

A number of databases contain information about human metabolic
networks consisting of compounds, Chemical reactions, pathways,
enzymes and genes. In Metscape, we used data from HUMDB
(Beecher, 2003; C.Beecher, unpublished data), KEGG (Kanehisa
et al., 2006) and EHMN (Ma et al., 2007) to trace the connections
between metabolites and genes. We created a Microsoft SQL Server
database to store these data. KEGG IDs are used as the primary
compound identiﬁer. Our database contains nearly 2700 compounds,
870 enzymes, 1400 genes and 3000 metabolic reactions involved in
over 70 human-speciﬁc metabolic pathways deﬁned in EHMN. We
decided to use EHMN as a starting point because it appeared to
be very well cross-referenced with the KEGG database. KEGG is
widely known and many biologists and potential users of our tools
use it as a reference. We fully intend to merge additional databases—
e.g. we are currently in the process of merging in BIGG. We expect
HumanCyc will be next.

Compounds, reactions, enzymes, genes, pathways and the
relationships between them provide the initial framework for the
analysis of metabolomic data.

2.2 Visualization of metabolomic network

Visualization of metabolomic networks poses a number of
Challenges. Typically, metabolic networks possess a high degree of

connectivity (Bourqui et al., 2007; Wegner and Kummer, 2005).
A number of different layout algorithms had been developed for
Cytoscape that attempt to minimize the crossings between the
edges, the distances between nodes and the bending of the edges.
Users can easily apply Cytoscape layouts through the Cytoscape
layout menu to the compound network generated by Metscape.
To start-up Metscape, users select Metscape from the plug-ins
menu in Cytoscape. The Metscape main window has three tabs
that provide users with the following options: (i) load a list of
compounds (compound names or KEGG IDs), (ii) load a ﬁle
containing normalized experimental metabolite data with metabolite
KEGG IDs and corresponding values at given time points or under
speciﬁc experimental conditions and (iii) display pathway-speciﬁc
networks by Choosing a pathway from the drop-down list.

Metscape can generate two types of networks—a compound
network, where compounds are nodes and reactions are edges,
and a compound reaction network represented by a bipartite graph
(Lacroix et al., 2008) (Fig. l). The latter consists of two types
of nodes, compounds (hexagons) and reactions (rectangles). In
both network styles, edges are directional. A compound node
with an outgoing edge is a substrate, while a compound with an
incoming edge is the product of a speciﬁc reaction. In compound-
Centric networks, the reversible reactions are shown by bidirectional
arrows, while in reaction-centric networks reversible (purple) and
irreversible (maize) reactions can be distinguished by the node edge
color.

Metscape provides two network styles for users to Choose before
creating a network and allows users to switch between two network
views at any time after the network is created.

Metscape takes advantage of Cytoscape’s VizMapper to create the
Metscape visual style. User-inputted compounds are shown in blue,
while the rest of the compound nodes are shown in pink. Metscape
also uses a thicker node border to denote reactions with multiple
enzymes. Detailed information can be found in the Metscape legend
that is displayed at the beginning of each Metscape session.

When a user hovers the cursor over a reaction node, all compounds
that participate in the reaction are highlighted. Metscape allows
users to create a reaction-speciﬁc subnetwork from the highlighted
compounds. Users can expand a compound network by adding
reactions and compounds from the database; expanding the network
will keep the current view that the original network is using. When
done, users can collapse the expanded network or restore the original
network.

2.3 Interpretation of metabolomic data

Once the network has been displayed in Metscape, users can import
normalized experimental metabolite data from a tab-delimited ﬁle,
where the ﬁrst column always contains compound IDs. The detailed
description of the format for experimental data ﬁle is contained
in the online Metscape documentation. Node color and size can
be used to represent two different parameters simultaneously,
e.g. concentration and fold Change. In order to visualize the
experimentally measured Changes in metabolite concentrations
over time or under speciﬁc conditions, we adopted and modiﬁed
plug-in—dynamicXpr (http://Chianti.ucsd.edu/cyto_web/plugins/).
Metscape can handle up to 80 data points (conditions or time
points). Users can cycle through the data points sequentially. If the
experimental values have wide range and/or the distribution of the
data values is skewed, users can Choose to represent the data on a
log scale or rescale input data to a range from 0 to 10. This allows
for better and more obvious visualized results.

Users can obtain detailed information about compounds and
reactions by double Clicking a node. For compounds, Metscape
will display compound name, synonyms, formula, 2D structure,
molecular weight, CAS number and smiles string. Metscape also
provides links to MiMI (Tarcea et al., 2009), HMDB (Wishart
et al., 2009), KEGG, PubChem, ChEBI and BioCyC. For reactions,
Metscape shows the equation, pathway and reversibility. In addition,
enzymes and genes involved in the reaction are shown.

Besides selecting a pathway from a drop-down list as described
above, Metscape provides a pathway ﬁlter that can highlight
pathway-speciﬁc reactions, which then can be used to create a
pathway-speciﬁc subnetwork in a new Cytoscape window.

A Metscape tutorial is available from http://metscape.ncibi.org.

3 CONCLUSION

Metscape (See Supplementary material for the comparison of
Metscape and other tools) provides a bioinformatics framework for
the analysis and interpretation of metabolomic data. Metabolomic
data from HUMDB, EHMN and KEGG are integrated and stored
in a database at NCIBI. Metscape provides users an interface to
query the database. Visualizing a compound network helps users to
trace connections between metabolites and genes, and understand
the relationships between compounds, reactions, enzymes, genes
and pathways. Visualizing metabolites with node color and size
Changes in a network at a series of time points can help users to
predict functions of metabolites. Linking compounds and reactions
to well-known metabolomic data sources helps researchers to verify
and better understand the presented metabolites.

Since March 2009 when the ﬁrst version of Metscape was
released, we have had >200 unique IPs (users/user groups), and the
number is still growing. For future work, we plan to integrate more
data from additional databases and provide more information like
enzyme activators and inhibitors from databases such as BRENDA
(Chang et al., 2009).

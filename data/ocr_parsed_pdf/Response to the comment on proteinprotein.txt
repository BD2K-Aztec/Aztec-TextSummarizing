We would like to thank M031 and Fernandez—Redo (2014) for their
insightful comments on our recent publication in Bioinformatics
(Yugandhar and Gromiha 2014). The main objective of the work
was to develop a method for predicting the binding affinity of
protein-protein complexes using sequence-based features. We have
utilized both predicted binding sites and amino acid properties for
developing the method. The method was formulated with inner fea-
ture selection and tested with outer leave-one-out cross-validation.
Our method could predict the binding affinity of 135 protein-
protein complexes within a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.759
using leave-one-out cross validation experiment. The statistical sig-
nificance of Pearson’s correlation was assessed with P-values. We
realized minor changes in the predicted binding sites at the local
computer and server due to the usage of different versions of the pre-
diction software, which moderater altered the results. Among the
39 protein-protein complexes used as a test set and six additional
complexes mentioned in M031 and Fernandez—Redo (2014) the
binding affinity of >50% of them were predicted within a deviation
of 2 kcal/mol (l4 complexes with <l kcal/mol). Further, three com-
plexes have high sequence identity with our initial set of complexes
and binding affinity of one of them differs by >4 kcal/mol due to
experimental conditions and/or different binding modes, which are
the limitations of our model as discussed in the article.

On the other hand, we have predicted the binding affinity of all
the considered 180 protein-protein complexes using average assign-
ment method (Saraboji et (11., 2006) for evaluating the performance of
the present method. We have assigned the binding affinity of each
complex using the average AG of all the 180 complexes as well as
the average in each group. We obtained a MAE of 2.150 and

l.63lkcal/mol, respectively. The performance of our method is
almost twice better than the average assignment method (MAE is
0.972).

We have utilized the single property correlation coefficient to
relate the important property with binding affinity and combination
of properties for predicting the binding affinity. For enzyme-
inhibitor complexes and other enzymes, experimental AG varies
in the ranges of 9—18kcal/mol and 6—13 kcal/mol, respectively. The
predicted binding affinities also span in these wide ranges. In addi-
tion, four typical complexes with high and low affinities in these
classes are correctly predicted within an average MAE of lkcal/mol.
The assignment of random values (or average) showed an average
MAE of ~4 kcal/mol.

Further, we have refined our model, which showed a better per-
formance in both cross-validation and test datasets, and the details
will be reported elsewhere.

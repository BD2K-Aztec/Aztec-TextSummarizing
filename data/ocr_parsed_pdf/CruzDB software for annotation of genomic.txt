After this loop, we will have a ﬁle of the genes that have a
miR—96 binding site in their 3/ UTR. We can also send the genes
to DAVID (Huang et al., 2009) in a single command:

Genome. david_go (refseq_ids)

This will open a genome browser window with the genes
loaded into DAVID. Even with this short example, we identify
relationships that are biologically plausible. We know that miR—
96 is associated with hearing loss (Menca et al., 2009); when we
look at the ontology enrichment from DAVID (Supplementary
File S3), we see terms associated with synapses and cell junction
which are, in turn, known to be associated with deafness and
hearing loss (Martinez et al., 2009). Although our ﬁndings in this
example are not necessarily novel, it does demonstrate the use of
our approach in identifying enrichment of biologically relevant
functions in the set of genes with a common miR binding site,
which can be helpful in prioritizing gene lists to identify disease
(or other condition) relevant regulatory elements.

4.2 Replication timing

DNA replication in the human genome is spatiotemporally seg—
regated such that some genomic regions are replicated early and
some late (Hansen et al., 2010). It was previously suggested that
gene—rich regions replicated early. But it was not surveyed
whether both exons and introns replicate early, or whether the
replication timing pattern is context dependent even at a ﬁner
scale. Integrating DNA replication timing data from multiple cell
types, and using the deﬁnition provided by Hansen et a1. (2010),
we marked the ‘constant early’ and ‘constant late’ replication
timing regionsiie. the regions that were replicated early and
late irrespective of the cell type tested. Integrating this locally
hosted dataset with CpG island, and refGene data—tables from
the UCSC genome browser, we find that early—replicating regions
are enriched for gene bodies and for CpG islands relative to the
late—replicating regions (Supplementary Files S4 and S5), which
is consistent with that reported by Hansen et a]. (2010). In con—
trast, we ﬁnd that introns are relatively more likely to be repli—
cated late. For instance, among those regions that fall within a
gene, there is 152% enrichment for late—replicating regions that
fall entirely in an intron (without touching an exon) relative
to early—replicating regions. When we restrict to coding genes
with at least one intron, the enrichment goes up to 159%
(Supplementary Files S6 and S7). Although it requires further
investigation, this is a novel ﬁnding that suggests that even
though gene—rich regions are replicated early, there are flner—
scale replication timing patterns that correlate with introni
exon structures.

4.3 LincRNAs

Complex genetic diseases are usually associated with multiple
common and rare genetic variants. Although a small subset of
these variants overlap with known genes, many reside in non—
protein coding regions. Some of these variants were shown to
affect regulatory elements that affect expression of known genes.
Non—coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are a class of regulatory RNAs
that play important roles in development, cancer and other dis—
eases. LincRNAs are a relatively recently identified class of
ncRNA, which play key role in epigenetic regulation (Lee,

2012), and there are >20 000 predicted lincRNA genes in the
human genome. So far, the genetic variants have not been
systematically surveyed in the context of different classes of
ncRNAs including lincRNAs.

Here, we use lincRNA transcripts available in the UCSC hg19
from Cabili et a]. (2011) and overlap with the genome—wide asso—
ciation study (GWAS) catalog from NHGRI (Hindorff et al.,
2009) as available in UCSC’s gwasCatalog table. The catalog
contains a list of 12 194 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
that have been associated with one of over 600 traits. After
annotating with CruzDB (Supplementary File S8), we examined
SNPs from the GWAS catalog that overlapped a lincRNA, and
especially those that were >10 kb from the nearest gene. Using
these criteria, we found 388 SNPs that overlapped a lincRNA
and were also sufflciently distant from known RefSeq genes.
When we enumerate the trait (disease category) with the highest
proportion of SNPs that fall within a lincRNA distant to a gene
and then ﬁlter to those that show at least five SNPs within a
lincRNA, some traits among the highest by this metric are intel—
ligence (5 of 57 SNPs fall in lincRNAs) and other categories
related to cognitive disorders (Supplementary File S9).
Although overlap does not automatically indicate causality, it
is consistent with the role of these lincRNAs in development.
There are several more instances where disease—associated vari—
ants overlap with lincRNAs with relevant biological functions.

Using more relaxed criteria, where an SNP was selected simply
if it was closer to a lincRNA than to the nearest gene, we found
2153 SNPs (Supplementary File S10). Our findings combined
with the recent study showing a lower incidence of SNPs
within lincRNAs (Chen et al., 2013) show the importance of
annotating GWAS results with lincRNAs in addition to genes.

4.4 Lamina-associated domains

Within the nucleus, different genomic regions occupy distinct
nuclear territories, such that some regions are in contact with
nuclear laminaitermed lamina—associated domains or LADs
(Dittmer and Misteli, 2011; Guelen et al., 2008). These regions
usually have repressive chromatin marks and lower levels of gene
expression. However, it has not yet been investigated systemat—
ically whether certain classes of genes are more clustered in
LADs compared with that expected by chance. Overlaying
data on LADs from Guelen et a]. (2008), and known genes, we
ﬁnd over 5000 genes overlap completely/partially with the LADs
(Supplementary File S11). Furthermore, piping the genes that
overlap a LAD with a score >0.9 (the fraction of probes with
a positive smoothed log—ratio) to the DAVID gene—ontology
enrichment software (Huang et al., 2009), we report strong
enrichment for categories related to olfaction (adjusted
P <1e—80), G—protein coupled receptor (adjusted P <1e—60) and
other categories related to sensing (Supplementary File S12).
Our findings are consistent with a recent report (Clowney
et al., 2012) that nuclear clustering of olfactory receptor genes
governs their monogenic expression. It is suspected that laminB
receptor—induced changes in nuclear architecture inﬂuences sin—
gular transcription pattern of the olfactory receptor genes
(Clowney et al., 2012).

When we create a stricter subset of genes by filtering to those
with a score greater than 0.9 that fall entirely within an LAD, we

find even stronger enrichment of olfaction and related terms
(adjusted P <1e—106), G—protein coupled recepter (adjusted
P <1e—95, Supplementary File S13).

5 DISCUSSION

We have showcased the programmatic interface of CruzDB
using miRNA binding sites as motivation, and further demon—
strated its utility using three biological examples. The biological
examples and their CruzDB code demonstrate the simple syntax,
and the potential of this utility to facilitate hypothesis—driven
studies. Although the examples we have shown are in human
version hg19, CruzDB can be used for any organism and version
available in the UCSC database by using, for example, ‘dmj" as
the initializer.

Although previous studies have demonstrated higher order
organization of DNA replication timing patterns in the human
genome, our observation that replication timing patterns correl—
ate with introniexon structures reveals a finer—scale stratification
of DNA replication patterns within gene regions. LincRNAs
play major regulatory roles in different biological processes in
neuronal and other tissue types, but their role in complex cogni—
tive traits and diseases has not been systematically assessed yet.
We report several instances where disease—associated variants
overlap with lincRNAs with relevant biological functions.
Our findings, combined with the recent study showing a lower
incidence of SNPs within lincRNAs (Chen et al., 2013), highlight
the importance of examining GWAS hits in this context. Finally,
integrating data on LADs and protein—coding regions, we find
that olfactory receptor genes are highly enriched in the LADs.
Our findings are consistent with a recent report that nuclear
clustering of olfactory receptor genes governs their monogenic
expression, and that laminB receptor—induced changes in nuclear
architecture inﬂuence singular transcription pattern of the
olfactory receptor genes (Clowney et al., 2012).

Further work needs to be done to validate this work and to
demonstrate the broader impact of our findings in each of these
four biological cases in detail, we aim to pursue them outside the
scope of this method article. Nevertheless, the four examples
outline the broad utility of CruzDB and its applications in
diverse areas of biomedical research.

6 CONCLUSION

We have introduced CruzDB, a parallelizable and intuitive pro—
grammatic interface with UCSC genome browser that allows
integrative context—dependent analyses of diverse local and
remotely hosted datasets, as well as annotation and spatial
querying. Some of the functions that make CruzDB a library

of broad and general utility are the feature extraction, fast quer—
ies and simple syntax. Using the library, one can mirror the
UCSC databases to a local SQLite or MySQL database, perform
location—based queries and perform integrative analyses combin—
ing local and remotely hosted features. We have shown how
to create a local copy of selected tables is a single line of
code and how having that local copy improves the speed of
later analyses.

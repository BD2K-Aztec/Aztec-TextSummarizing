Abstract

Summary: Structural variations (SVs) are large genomic rearrangements that vary significantly in
size, making them challenging to detect with the relatively short reads from next—generation
sequencing (NGS). Different SV detection methods have been developed; however, each is limited
to specific kinds of SVs with varying accuracy and resolution. Previous works have attempted to
combine different methods, but they still suffer from poor accuracy particularly for insertions. We
propose MetaSV, an integrated SV caller which leverages multiple orthogonal SV signals for high
accuracy and resolution. MetaSV proceeds by merging SVs from multiple tools for all types of SVs.
It also analyzes soft—clipped reads from alignment to detect insertions accurately since existing
tools underestimate insertion SVs. Local assembly in combination with dynamic programming is
used to improve breakpoint resolution. Paired—end and coverage information is used to predict SV
genotypes. Using simulation and experimental data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MetaSV
across various SV types and sizes.

1 Introduction

 

SVs have been implicated in contributing to genomic diversity as
well as genomic disorders (Stankiewicz and Lupski, 2010).
Therefore, a significant amount of work has been done on detecting
SVs. Generally, a tool for detecting SVs uses one or more of the fol-
lowing signals from read alignments: split-read |reads with split
alignments, e.g. Pindel (Ye et (11., 2009)|, read-pair |abnormal

paired-end alignments, e.g. BreakDancer (Chen et (11., 2009)|, depth-
of-coverage |abnormal coverages, e.g. (INVnator (Abyzov et (11.,
2011)|, junction-mapping |alignments to known SV breakpoints,
e.g. BreakSqu (Abyzov et (11., 2015; Lam et (11., 2010)| or assembly
around potential breakpoints |e.g. MindTheGap (Rizk et (11.,
2014)|. However, there is no signal that comprehensiver detects all
types of SVs since each has a niche of SV types and sizes where it

ABSTRACT

Summary: Gene Ontology and other forms of gene-category
analysis play a major role in the evaluation of high-throughput
experiments in molecular biology. Single-category enrichment
analysis procedures such as Fisher’s exact test tend to flag
large numbers of redundant categories as significant, which can
complicate interpretation. We have recently developed an approach
called model-based gene set analysis (MGSA), that substantially
reduces the number of redundant categories returned by the gene-
category analysis. In this work, we present the Bioconductor package
mgsa, which makes the MGSA algorithm available to users of the R
language. Our package provides a simple and flexible application
programming interface for applying the approach.

Availability: The mgsa package has been made available as part of
Bioconductor 2.8. It is released under the conditions of the Artistic
license 2.0.

1 INTRODUCTION

Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and other forms of gene-set
enrichment analysis have become a standard exploratory tool for
understanding the results of large-scale genomics experiments and
for generating new hypotheses (Robinson and Bauer, 2011). Most
early approaches investigated each GO term one at a time, for
example testing for signiﬁcant enrichment of responder genes in
each term using Fisher’s exact test. In contrast, two recent methods,
GenGO and model-based gene set analysis (MGSA) have been
developed as global approaches, in which one aims to ﬁnd the
best combination of GO terms to explain the observed biological
response (Bauer et al., 2010; Lu et al., 2008). Such global, or ‘model-
based’ approaches avoid problems connected with the statistical
dependencies inherent in large ontologies such as the GO, in
which gene annotations are propagated to ancestor terms, or in any
collection of gene sets in which the categories share many annotated
genes.

MGSA analyzes all GO categories at once by modeling
gene response as a function of the combination of active GO
terms. It employs probabilistic inference via a Metropolis-Hasting
algorithm to estimate the probability of categories to be active.
The MGSA approach naturally takes category overlap into account

and avoids the need for multiple testing corrections met in single-
category enrichment analysis. More details of the procedure can
be found in the original publication, where we also demonstrated
that MGSA substantially improves upon single-category statistical
enrichment analysis methods and GenGO. Real-life applications
have shown the utility of the method in identifying concise yet
informative list of categories (Bauer et al., 2010; Ott et al.,
2011). In our original work, we integrated a ﬁrst implementation
of MGSA into the Ontologizer application, which is a tool
for GO analysis and allows user to inspect the results in an
interactive environment (Bauer et al., 2008). Here, we present an
implementation of MGSA for users of Bioconductor (Gentleman
et al., 2004). The mgsa package wraps a fast C-based implementation
of the MGSA algorithm into a ﬂexible application programming
interface (API) and utilizes OpenMP to take advantage of the multi-
core processing units that modern computer hardware offers (Dagum
and Menon, 1998).

2 AVAILABILITY AND USAGE

The mgsa package is part of Bioconductor 2.8, therefore it can
be installed directly within the R environment together with
all its dependencies. Refer to the Bioconductor Web page at
http://www.bioconductor.org/ for installation procedures.

Once the package is installed and loaded, the method can be
readily accessed using the function mgs a. To invoke the function,
one needs to specify the observations, a vector of gene identiﬁers
corresponding to the study set (e.g. the set of differentially expressed
genes), and the gene sets, a list of vectors of gene identiﬁers for each
of the GO terms (or other gene sets or categories) to be analyzed.

To simplify the usage of G0, the readGAF function takes a GAF
(Gene Annotation Format) ﬁle as input, in which gene annotations
are stored, and computes the gene sets of all GO categories including
direct and indirect annotations. GAF ﬁles are available from the GO
homepage and updated regularly. The ﬁinction takes advantage of
the G0.db package to load the structure of the GO, so no external
ﬁle is needed for the ontology itself. If goa . f i lename contains
the location of a GAF ﬁle, observations is a vector of character
strings describing the genes of the study set, then an MGSA analysis
is as simple as entering the following R code.

3 APPLICATION

The MGSA package is not restricted to the GO but allows analysis
with arbitrary gene sets. This ﬂexibility is illustrated on a dataset
in which gene expression for two yeast strains that differ by a
single allele (PH084; Gagneur et al., 2009) is compared. We ask
which transcription factor(s) could together best explain the set of
84 transcripts that show differential expression. We stored these as
vector of gene identiﬁers, observations:

"YBROSOC " "YBRO54W" "YBRO93C "

MacIsaac et al. (2006) have compiled a regulatory network for
yeast by integrating data of in vivo transcription factor binding
from ChIP/chip together with transcription factor motif analysis and
sequence conservation. We deﬁned as gene sets the sets of targets of
each transcription factor of the network with intermediate cutoffs for
binding intensities and conservation (MacIsaac et al., 2006). This
network contains a total of 2514 targets across 116 transcription
factors. We simply stored it as a named list of vectors of gene
identiﬁers, sets:

$ABF1
[1] "YPL242C" "YPL159C" "YPLOlZW"
$ACE2
[l] "YORl4OW" "YORl38C" "YNL327W"

For instance, the ﬁrst item of the list contains a vector of genes that
are targets of the transcription factor ABF l as predicted by MacIsaac
et al. (2006). We can now call the mgsa method and plot results:

results <— mgsa(observations,sets)
plot(results)

The plot displays the marginal probabilities of the 10 most
likely sets (Fig. 1). MGSA infers changes in activity for the PH04
transcription factor (posterior: 0.9995 :I:2 X 10—4). Allele variation
in the transporter PH084 affects cellular phosphate levels and
regulation of the whole PHO pathway (Gagneur et al., 2009).
These transcriptional changes are known to be mediated by the
transcription factor PH04, which MGSA precisely identiﬁed.

4 CONCLUSION

The mgsa package gives users of Bioconductor programmatic access
to MGSA. Thus, it can be incorporated into scripts and pipelines
written in R and be combined with many other packages of the
bioinformatics community. The package comes with a simple but
ﬂexible API, which allows researchers not only to use GO as

Abstract

Summary: Understanding the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the expression
level of genes is an important goal. We recently published a study in which we devised a multi—
SNP predictive model for gene expression in Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL), and showed that it
can robustly predict the expression of a small number of genes in test individuals. Here, we valid—
ate the generality of our models by predicting expression profiles for genes in LCL in an independ—
ent study, and extend the pool of predictable genes for which we are able to explain more than
25% of their expression variability to 232 genes across 14 different cell types. As the number of
people who obtained their SNP profiles through companies such as 23andMe is rising rapidly, we
developed GenoEXp, a web—based tool in which users can upload their individual SNP data and ob—
tain predicted expression levels for the set of predictable genes across the 14 different cell types.
Our tool thus allows users with biological knowledge to study the possible effects that their set of
SNPs might have on these genes and predict their cell—specific expression levels relative to the
population average.

1 Introduction

In recent years, individual genotype |i.e. single nucleotide poly-
morphisms (SNPs)| data have become readily accessible via direct-
to-consumer genetic testing (DTCGT) companies such as 23andMe,
deCODEme and Navigenics. These companies allow users to
acquire their allele calls at ~0.5M SNPs across the genome, as well
as a report of higher and lower risk for certain diseases, based on
their genotyped SNPs. Since we have recently developed methods to
robustly predict gene expression solely from genotype (Manor and
Segal, 2013), we decided to enable users to predict their own gene
expression across multiple cell types. To this end, we developed

GenoExp, a web-based tool where users can upload their raw geno-
type files obtained from any DTCGT company, and view their pre-
dicted gene expression (for a set of predictable genes) across 14
different cell types.

To demonstrate the application of GenoExp, we used 23andMe
genotype data provided willingly by one individual. We show the re-
sulting predictions of gene expression and highlight examples such
as a gene known to play a role in learning and memory that is pre-
dicted to be expressed above population-mean in brain cells of that
individual.

GenoExp: predicting gene expression from SNPs

2 Results

Our recently published method (Manor and Segal, 2013) was developed
using genotype and gene expression data taken from Lymphoblastoid
cell lines (LCLs) of 715 individuals. Therefore, we wished to test
whether we could apply it to other tissues or cell types as well. For this
purpose, we obtained two additional independent datasets that con—
tained both genotype and gene expression measurements for different
individuals: Genotype—Tissue Expression (GTEx; Lonsdale et 41., 2013),
containing data from 91—166 individuals across 9 different cell types,
and Abundant Quantitative Trait Loci Exist for DNA Methylation and
Gene Expression in Human Brain (Brain-eQTL; Gibbs et 41., 2010),
containing data from 146 individuals across 4 different brain cell types.
Our full dataset thus included gene expression data from a total of
18 124 unique genes across 1039 different individuals in 14 cell types
(Supplementary Table 51). Next, we ran our predictive pipeline separ—
ately for the data in each of the 14 cell types (Supplementary Figs.
51—54). Specifically, for each cell type we used a strict 5—fold cross—valid—
ation scheme to learn a predictive model for the expression of each gene
from the genotype of its cis—SNPs across individuals, and evaluated the
performance of our models on held—out test individuals from the same
gene and cell type. We found that across all cell types, a total of 232
unique genes exceeded an R2 of 0.25 on test data (i.e. more than 25 %
of expression variability is explained on held—out individuals) in at least
one of the cell types. These genes were therefore defined as predictable
genes (Supplementary Table 52). Next, to test the generality of our
models, we further obtained additional genotype data coupled with
gene expression measurements of 381 twin—pairs (i.e. a total of 762 indi—
viduals) from the Multiple Tissue Human Expression Resource
(MuTHER; Grundberg et 41., 2012). When applying the models learned
from LCLs to the MuTHER data, we found that in 79% of cases, we
predicted the correct direction of over— or under—expression (see
Supplementary text for extended details), strengthening the validity of
our predictions.

Finally, we wanted to allow users to predict their own gene
expression across multiple cell types using our predictive models. To
this end, we developed GenoExp, a web—based tool where users can
upload their raw genotype files obtained from any DTCGT com—
pany (e.g. 23andMe), and view their predicted gene expression (for
the predictable genes) across the different 14 cell types
(Supplementary Fig. SS). To demonstrate the application of
GenoExp, we used 23andME genotype data willingly provided by
one individual (Supplementary Fig. S6). We found that for this indi—
vidual, some genes are predicted as expressed above population—
mean in all cell types where prediction is possible (e.g. HLA—DRBS,
SNPs used for prediction in skin shown in Supplementary Fig. S7),
whereas other genes are predicted as expressed below population—
mean (e.g. KCT D10). Clearly, this over— and under—expression does
not necessarily imply functional consequences, yet they could be
suggestive. For example, the gene CHURC1, which was predicted to
be expressed above population—mean in all 4 cell types in the brain,
has a homolog that was shown to play a key role in the development
of neurons (Sheng et al., 2003), and a deletion of the genomic region
containing it has been linked to autism (Griswold et al., 2011). In
addition, the AMFR gene that was shown to be involved in the pro—
cess of learning and memory in the central nervous system of mice
(Yang et al., 2012) was also predicted to be expressed above popu—
lation—mean in the brain cells of the tested individual.

3 Discussion

One of the major goals of human genomics and medicine today is to
reach the stage of personalized medicine. That is, tailoring the

diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of diseases to a specific individ—
ual. The connections between gene expression and various human
diseases have long been made, and over— and under—expression of
specific genes have been shown to promote or protect from certain
diseases. In addition, studies have shown that many SNPs are signifi—
cantly associated with the expression of various genes, although no
predictive models are usually offered in these studies, making it
impossible for an individual to predict their own gene expression
from SNPs. This drawback has led us to recently publish a study
where we learn a predictive model of gene expression from multiple
SNPs. This modeling framework allows both the combination of dif—
ferent SNPs in the model, and the ability to predict the expression of
a gene in unseen individuals given their entire SNP profile. Here, we
extend our predictive models to 232 genes where we can explain
25 % or more of the expression variability in held—out test individ—
uals in at least one of 14 cell types.

As acquiring one’s genetic data (i.e. SNP values) to learn more
about his or her own disease risks and biology is becoming easier and
more prevalent through companies such as 23andMe, we set out to
build a web—based tool, that would allow users to input their measured
SNP values, and obtain predictions of gene expression across the vari—
ous cell types in our study. We acknowledge that currently, only indi—
viduals that have biological knowledge could potentially benefit from
our tool. However, we believe that as more data of genotype and
phenotype becomes available, models such as ours can become more
sophisticated, allowing more accurate predictions of gene expression
profiles and ultimately of organismal phenotypes such as disease risks
or possible adverse effects of drugs, thereby enabling users to take
more knowledge—based actions when it comes to their well—being.

4 Methods

4.1 Data and pre—processing

For the HapMap LCL dataset, we downloaded the SNP genotypes of
phase 3 (Altshuler et 41., 2010) and obtained gene expression measure—
ments for genes of these individuals from (Stranger et al., 2012). For
the GTEx and Brain—eQTL datasets, we downloaded the SNP geno—
type and gene expression measurements from (Gibbs et 41., 2010;
Lonsdale et al., 2013) after obtaining approval. For the MuTHER
dataset, we downloaded SNP genotype from (Grundberg et 41., 2012)
and corresponding gene expression measurements from the
ArrayExpress website (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/). Except
for normalization of expression data discussed below, we did not pro—
cess the data further than the processing done by the original publica—
tions. For each gene, we extracted all cis—SNPs located inside the gene
or within 100 kb from the transcription start or end sites (gene loca—
tions were downloaded from the UCSC genome browser and SNP lo—
cations from dbSNP). We transformed each SNP to a discrete variable
with values of 0, 1 or 2, corresponding to the number of minor alleles
that each individual carries for the SNP. Therefore, an individual with
0 minor alleles will have a value of 0, etc.

4.2 Data normalization

Since the absolute values of gene expression in each dataset could be
different given the measurement platforms, to remove dataset
specific effects, we normalized the expression of every gene across
all individuals in each dataset to have a mean equal to 0 and stand—
ard deviation equal to 1.

4.3 Learning a predictive model of gene expression
For each gene, we learned a separate predictive model for each of
the 14 cell types in which the gene was expressed. We used the set

[310'sp2umofp105xo'sopeuHOJIItotq/ﬁdnq

O.Manor and E.Segal

 

of cis—SNPs as covariates in the prediction problem, and learned
the predictive model as described in Manor and Segal (2013).
However, due to the fact that the K—Nearest—Neighbor model is both
memory and computationally intensive, in the web—tool we re—
stricted ourselves to the regularized linear version of the model
(Supplementary Fig. 51).

4.4 Selecting the set of predictable genes

To select the set of predictable genes, we used the coefficient of
determination (i.e. R2) as out threshold. R2 is a measure of the pro—
portion of variance explained that is widely used when assessing the
accuracy of models aiming to predict a continuous variable such as
gene expression. The threshold of R2 2 0.25 is chosen since explain—
ing over 25% of individual gene expression variability on held—out
test data is considered by us to be a useful prediction.

4.5 Building a web—based tool to enable users to predict
their expression

For the web tool, we use a combination of Perl and Matlab scripts
to do the following: (i) Upload the user’s SNP genotypes file (i.e.
from 23andMe) from the web form to the server. (ii) Impute the
missing SNPs needed by the gene specific models using
the IMPUTE2 (Howie et at, 2011, 2009) software, and using the
1000 Genomes Project together with HapMap data as the genome
reference for imputation. (iii) Predict the expression of available
genes given the user’s SNPs (iv) Create a table that summarizes
the results and links out to various resources regarding the predicted
genes (Supplementary Figs. 55—57).

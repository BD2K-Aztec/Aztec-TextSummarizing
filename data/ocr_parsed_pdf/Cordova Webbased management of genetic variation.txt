include gene symbol, variant locale, HGVS nucleotide change
and amino acid change, functional prediction scores, conserva—
tion prediction scores and allele counts. Additional ﬁelds are
supplied for clinical signiﬁcance, phenotype, PubMed ID and
general comments. Although any ﬁeld can be edited, auto—
populated fields are locked for editing by default to protect
against submission of accidental misinformation. If a refSNP
ID is supplied, a link to dbSNP will be provided automatically.
Likewise, if a PubMed ID is supplied, a link to the corresponding
PubMed entry will be included automatically.

For quality control, Cordova uses a queuing system, so users
can choose to keep certain variations private while under review.
When a user submits a new variation to the database, it will be
entered into the queue and hidden from the public. If an existing
variation is edited, any new changes will be held in the queue
while older entries remain visible to the public. Variations in the
queue can be released to the public at any time on review.
Options are available to release either all variations in the
queue at once or only those selected by the user. Users may
also schedule a variation for removal from future database
releases. Additionally, the database is robust to data versioning,
so users can maintain copies of previous database releases and
rollback to an earlier version if needed. Users who make queries
via the Web API have the option to specify which version of the
database to query. Data versioning is not supported by LOVD.

Cordova supports six pathogenicity prediction scores available
from deSFP2, including SIFT (Kumar et al, 2009), Polyphen—
2 (Adzhubei et al, 2010), MutationTaster (Schwarz et al, 2010),
LRT (Chun and Fay, 2009), phyloP (Siepel et al, 2006) and
GERP++ (Davydov et al, 2010). Before manual curation, a
variation can automatically be assigned a preliminary clinical
significance classiﬁcation based on the sum of these scores. If
at least 60% of the available predictions have a pathogenic im—
plication, a label of ‘possibly pathogenic’ will be assigned to that
variation. Otherwise a label of ‘predicted non—pathogenic’ will be
assigned. For variations with less than five prediction scores
available, a label of ‘unknown signiﬁcance’ will be assigned.

Users may manually change the clinical signiﬁcance label at
any time. The prediction scores are also accompanied by a
color—coded visual representation to easily understand the signifi—
cance of each report. Red means the variant is predicted to be
pathogenic, green means non—pathogenic and gray means that no
score was provided from that particular algorithm. In compari—
son, LOVD does not offer a comparable feature for automated
pathogenicity prediction, and therefore, users must manually
provide clinical signiﬁcance classiﬁcations.

Cordova comes packaged with an example pipeline to retrieve
the necessary variation annotation data for auto—population. The
pipeline is Ruby—based and can be used as a stand—alone com—
mand—line tool. Its output is conﬁgurable and can be tailored to
local database needs, including customized interpretations of
prediction and conservation scores from deSFP2. It uses
compressed versions of annotation files to reduce their total foot—
print by one—third, and runs approximately eight times faster
than deSFP2’s native querying application for large sets of
annotations.

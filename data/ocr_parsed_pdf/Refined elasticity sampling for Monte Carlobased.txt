Abstract

Motivation: Structural kinetic modelling (SKM) is a framework to analyse whether a metabolic
steady state remains stable under perturbation, without requiring detailed knowledge about indi—
vidual rate equations. It provides a representation of the system's Jacobian matrix that depends
solely on the network structure, steady state measurements, and the elasticities at the steady state.
For a measured steady state, stability criteria can be derived by generating a large number of
SKMs with randomly sampled elasticities and evaluating the resulting Jacobian matrices. The
elasticity space can be analysed statistically in orderto detect network positions that contribute sig—
nificantly t0 the perturbation response. Here, we extend this approach by examining the kinetic
feasibility 0fthe elasticity combinations created during Monte Carlo sampling.

Results: Using a set of small example systems, we show that the majority of sampled SKMs would
yield negative kinetic parameters if they were translated back into kinetic models. To overcome
this problem, a simple criterion is formulated that mitigates such infeasible models. After evaluat—
ing the small example pathways, the methodology was used to study two steady states of the
neuronal TCA cycle and the intrinsic mechanisms responsible for their stability or instability. The
findings of the statistical elasticity analysis confirm that several elasticities are jointly coordinated
to control stability and that the main source for potential instabilities are mutations in the enzyme
alpha—ketoglutarate dehyd rogenase.

1 Introduction

Metabolic systems tend to exhibit steady states that can be measured
in terms of the concentrations and fluxes of the metabolites
involved. These measurements can be regarded as a phenotypic
representation of all the complex interactions and regulatory mech-
anisms taking place in the underlying metabolic pathway. Such
interactions determine the system’s response to external perturb-
ations and are responsible, for example, for its asymptotic stability
or for oscillatory trajectories around the steady state. However,
determining these perturbation responses in the absence of
fully specified kinetic models remains an important challenge of
computational systems biology.

Structural kinetic modelling (SKM) is a framework to analyse such
responses to perturbations, without requiring detailed knowledge
about individual rate equations (Reznik and Segre, 2010; Reznik
et (11., 2013; Steuer et (11., 2006). It provides a parameterized represen-
tation of the system’s Jacobian matrix in which the model parameters
encode information about the enzyme-metabolite interactions.
Stability criteria can be derived by generating a large number of struc-
tural kinetic models (SKMs) with randomly sampled parameter sets
and evaluating the resulting Jacobian matrices. The parameter space
can be analysed statistically in a Monte Carlo experiment in order to
detect pathway positions that contribute significantly to the perturb-
ation response. Because the sampled parameters are equivalent to the

Reﬁned elasticity sampling for Monte Carlo—based identiﬁcation of stabilizing network patterns i215

 

elasticities used in metabolic control analysis (MCA) (Kacser and
Porteous, 1987), the results are easy to interpret biologically.

In order to perform an SKM experiment, it is not necessary to
specify the kinetic rate laws in detail. However, the sampling
procedure requires the selection of predefined intervals for each elas—
ticity. The common procedure is to choose the interval (0,1] for
sampling elasticities that should represent enzymatic reactions. This
interval corresponds to the range of possible elasticity values for re—
actions following Michaelis Menten kinetics.

In this work, we demonstrate that if the assumption of Michaelis
Menten kinetics holds true, only very specific combinations of elas—
ticities allow the steady state to be maintained with non—negative
kinetic parameters. Because of this, an easily applicable criterion is
introduced that enables detecting elasticity combinations associated
with negative kinetic parameters of enzymatic reactions.

Furthermore, we examine how the sampled elasticities can be
analysed to derive quantitative thresholds for instabilities. This ap—
proach was already used in the past to examine stability conditions
of the Calvin Benson cycle (Girbig et al., 2012b). In this work, we
illustrate how these conditions affect the underlying kinetic param—
eters of the model. We examine how a simple example system reacts
to inducing such instabilities. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the
proposed methodology is applied to study destabilizing mechanisms
in the neuronal citric acid (TCA) cycle.

1.1 Introduction to SKM

Given a metabolic system with m metabolites S1. . . . .Sm and n reac—
tions U1.  ,Un, which can be defined by the ordinary differential
equation system

dS

_ : . :; f 1

d, N v<s> (s) r >

with stoichiometric matrix N, a steady state is defined as a point 8*
in the state space where no net changes in the concentrations can
occur and all reaction rates fulfill the mass balance equation

EzN-V(S*):0. (2)
The response of the system in steady state to small perturbations de—
pends on the asymptotic stability of the steady state. When it is asymp—
totically stable, a coordinated system response enables the return of
concentrations and ﬂuxes to the same values prior to the perturbation.
If the steady state is unstable, such a return is not supported.

Local dynamic properties of a steady state, like stability or oscilla—
tory behaviour, can be derived from the Jacobian matrix evaluated in
the steady state (Heinrich and Schuster, 1996). Hence, only if the larg—
est real part of the eigenvalues is negative, changes evoked by perturb—
ations diminish over time and the steady state is asymptotically stable.
Oscillatory trajectories occur if eigenvalues form a complex conjugate
pair. The oscillation is damped, stable or increasing if the largest real
part of the eigenvalues is negative, zero or positive, respectively.

Computation of the Jacobian matrix typically requires know—
ledge of all kinetic rate laws and kinetic parameters describing the
geactions in the system in order to compute the partial derivatives
(1//

without relying on such knowledge. Instead, it is derived by

where the matrix E contains the elasticities 6:, and A E Rm“ is the
matrix of normalized stoichiometric coefficients 1,3).

Elasticities are a central concept from MCA (Fell and Sauro,
1985; Fell, 1997; Kacser and Porteous, 1987). If associated with en—
zyme—catalysed reactions, they indicate the amount of saturation of
the enzyme with a particular metabolite. Because of this interpret—
ation, the sampled elasticities in SKM experiments are also called
‘saturation parameters” (Steuer et al., 2006). In particular, the larger
the absolute value of an elasticity, the less the enzyme catalysing the
reaction is saturated with its metabolite (Wang et al., 2004).

As demonstrated by Equation (4), the Jacobian matrix for a
given steady state, for which experimental measurements are avail—
able, can be derived solely from a set of model parameters (elastic—
ities) E 6 RW“, the stoichiometric matrix N, and the steady state
measurements 8* and v". Although the stoichiometry, the steady
state concentrations and the fluxes are experimentally accessible, the
elasticities are often unknown in practice. However, due to the nor—
malization step, they are restricted to pre—defined intervals, from
which they can be sampled in a Monte Carlo approach. This enables
the creation of a large number of models followed by the explor—
ation of the parameter space to detect regions associated with stabil—
ity or instability.

1.2 Deriving elasticities for enzymatic reactions

The interval boundaries for elasticity sampling are chosen according
to the type of kinetics employed by an enzyme. For example, if a re—
action U(S) follows irreversible Michaelis Menten kinetics

matrix in the steady state. Each eigenvector component therefore de-
scribes the time-dependent concentration changes in one metabolite.
Analysis of the eigenvector with largest real part indicated that per-
turbations led to an accumulation of AKG, accompanied by a de-
crease in the subsequent TCA cycle metabolites (Fig. 5).

3 Discussion

In this work, we demonstrated that if the assumption of Michaelis
Menten kinetics holds true, only very specific combinations of elas-
ticities allow the steady state to be maintained with non-negative
kinetic parameters. Because of this, an easily applicable filtering cri-
terion for enzymatic reactions with a single substrate and product
was introduced, that enabled the detection of elasticity combin-
ations associated with negative kinetic parameters.

Without elasticity filtering, the large abundance of SKMs with
kinetically implausible elasticity combinations can bias the output of
the numerical simulation. For example, analysis of a set of simple
example pathways showed that even for small models with 9—11
sampled elasticities, ~90% of the resulting SKMs contained elasti-
city combinations that required at least one negative value in the
kinetic parameters in order to enable emergence of the observed
steady state. Focusing only on those models with non-negative kin-
etic parameters hardly changed the numbers of stable models, but
strongly affected the frequency of oscillatory trajectories around the
steady state.

The idea of filtering the sampling space can be extended by tak-
ing into account further kinetic or dynamic restrictions on enzymes.
For instance, using the thermodynamic principle to limit the analysis
to thermodynamically feasible fluxes improves the predictive power
of metabolic models (Tepper et al., 2013). Furthermore, Monte
Carlo approaches for modelling metabolism could be refined by
incorporating such additional constraints (Murabito et al., 2014).

The filtering criterion introduced in Equation (19) offers a help-
ful starting point when sampling elasticities for reactions that can be
assumed to follow reversible Michaelis Menten kinetics. If
Michaelis Menten kinetics cannot be assumed it might still be pos-
sible to adapt the filtering criterion to reflect the underlying approxi-
mated kinetics. However, when analysing complex biological
systems, one has to be aware that the analytical derivation of similar
criteria for more complex rate laws is not possible in the same
straight-forward manner. For example, the TCA cycle model

models of the reference state that fulfilled the simplest instability condition
derived by decision trees. Each eigenvector component describes the time-
dependent concentration changes in one metabolite in neighbourhood of the
steady state. Concentrations that increased due to a perturbation are shown
in blue; decreasing metabolites are shown in red. Instabilities arise due to ac-
cumulation of AKG and a depletion in the subsequent metabolites

analysed contained only four reaction with a single substrate and
product each. Although 76.08% of all models could be corrected for
kinetical feasibility in these reactions, the challenge remains to de-
tect similar criteria for the remaining reactions in order to refine the
results of the Monte Carlo sampling. Recent improvements along
this line were presented by Ivanov et al. (2014), who analytically
derived general stability criteria for certain structural motifs of irre-
versible reactions with multiple substrates or products in the absence
of regulatory interactions.

In addition to introducing elasticity filtering, we illustrated in
this work how decision trees can derive refined multivariate elasti-
city patterns associated with different dynamic steady state proper-
ties. Such patterns can also capture scenarios in which a certain
dynamic property only emerges for a small parameter interval.
Because the Monte Carlo sampling in a high-dimensional space only
allows a sparse coverage of the parameter space, one has to keep in
mind that the derived rulesets do not capture all possible scenarios
that might theoretically emerge. When applying the proposed strat-
egy to a system of interest, it is therefore important to chose a sam-
ple size that is high enough to enable the emergence of reproducible
patterns, and to assess the generalization error on independently
sampled test sets.

4 Methods

4.1 Model construction

In order to account for the impact of pathway topology on the dy-
namic properties of steady states of a metabolic network, kinetic
models were constructed using three different pathway structures
(Fig. 1). Kinetic parameters and rate laws were chosen as uniformly
as possible in order to eliminate their influence on the outcome of
the analysis. KM values were set to the 3 for forward reactions and
to 30 for backward reactions. VrnZlX values were homogeneously set

to 1 (Supplementary Material for details). All reactions were mod—
elled using reversible Michaelis Menten kinetics. A positive feedback
term was included to increase the range of possible dynamic behav—
iours. Models were implemented in Matlab using the Systems
Biology Toolbox 2 for Matlab (Schmidt and ]irstrand, 2006).
Steady states were computed using the SBsteadystate function of the
Toolbox. SKMs were constructed using the MATLAB Toolbox for
SKM (Girbig et al., 2012a). Elasticity filtering was conducted during
Monte Carlo sampling by testing for each set of randomly sampled
elasticities whether they fulfilled the criterion in Equation (19).

For TCA cycle analysis, the kinetic model by Berndt et al. (2012)
served as a reference for network stoichiometry and steady—state infor—
mation. Two steady states were computed for SKM analysis which
represented different degrees of workload imposed on the cell. The
first state (also called reference state) represented a situation where
cytosolic Oz consumption was 50% of its maximum value. This cor—
responded to a moderate work amount of ATP consumption by the
cell (Berndt et al., 2012). In contrast, the second state (gamma oscilla—
tions) represented a scenario of strong workload and was computed
by setting cytosolic 0; consumption to 90% of the maximum value.

4.2 Model analysis

For each steady state, the numbers of stable and unstable SKMs were
counted in the unbalanced dataset of 104 randomly sampled models
with and without filtering for biological feasibility. Oscillatory and
non—oscillatory models were analysed in a similar manner.

Decision tree training was performed using the 5.0 library in R
(Kuhn et al., 2014) in the RULES mode. In total, 105 SKMs were
created as independent test samples. Because our aim was to derive
reliable conditions for stability and instability, we selected only
those rulesets with Laplace ratio > 0.95 that were derived from five
trees trained on 20 000 training samples each.

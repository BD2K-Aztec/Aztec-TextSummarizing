ABSTRACT

Summary: The Signaling Gateway Molecule Pages (SGMP)
database provides highly structured data on proteins which exist
in different functional states participating in signal transduction
pathways. A molecule page starts with a state of a native protein,
without any modification and/or interactions. New states are formed
with every post-translational modification or interaction with one
or more proteins, small molecules or class molecules and with
each change in cellular location. State transitions are caused by
a combination of one or more modifications, interactions and
translocations which then might be associated with one or more
biological processes. In a characterized biological state, a molecule
can function as one of several entities ortheir combinations, including
channel, receptor, enzyme, transcription factor and transporter. We
have also exported SGMP data to the Biological Pathway Exchange
(BioPAX) and Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) as well as
in our custom XML.

Availability: SGMP is available at www.signaling-gateway.org/
molecule.

1 BACKGROUND

Signal transduction in mammalian systems can be simple, like
transfer of ions, which results in change in the electrical potential
of the cell that, in turn, propagates the signal in the cell or more
complex signal transduction involving many intracellular protein
cascades (Gutkind, 1998). All these signaling processes are driven
by complex systems of functionally interacting molecules inside the
cell. Thus, understanding functional states of signaling molecules
and their interactions is essential to explain normal or pathological
biological function. During the past few years, there has been a
steady development of multiple resources on cellular signaling, e.g.
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (Kanehisa,
2002) and Reactome (Joshi-Tope et (11., 2005). All these databases
contain overall information on molecules involved in speciﬁc signal
transduction processes while some databases like the Database of

All presently published (655) molecule pages have the above data as of March 4, 2011.
3Class molecule (also called Protein Class) is represented by a group of two or more
proteins with sequence and/or functional homology (see ‘Class molecule’ section in
Supplementary Material), which is used as one of the state constituents.

Quantitative Cellular Signaling (DOQCS) (Hariharaputran et al.,
2003) have quantitative modeling data on cellular signaling. In an
effort to provide a holistic view of cellular signaling, we created a
repository derived from a comprehensive signaling protein ontology
(Li et (11., 2002) which covers functional states of a protein, the
transitions between those states and the deﬁned functions of a protein
in a given cellular context (Table 1). Further, we provide data on
quantitative parameters associated with each signaling function. The
SGMP database contains over 4000 mammalian signaling proteins
(see Supplementary Table S1 and S2) deposited as molecule pages
which are available either as published (peer reviewed via Nature
Publishing Group) or unpublished (awaiting peer review or awaiting
authoring).

A molecule page is deﬁned by a speciﬁc protein sequence
and as a consequence by its biophysical properties. All molecule
pages are augmented by sequence analysis and database-driven
automated annotation, providing details on sequence, domains and
motifs, interactions, pathways, sequence homology and structural
information where available. Each published molecule page contains
an abstract, a text summary and structured data on protein states,
state transitions and state functions. To the best of our knowledge,
no other resource provides details on experimentally characterized
functional states of signaling proteins.

2 DATA MODEL

The data model was developed by deﬁning states of a given protein,
biological processes associated with state transitions and functions
for each state.

2.1 State

A protein, which is represented by a molecule page, has at
least one state i.e. the native protein. This state represents a
molecule immediately following protein synthesis, before addition
of any post-translational modiﬁcations, and is the primary building
block for all other states. The new states are created based
on protein localization (Ashburner et (11., 2000) and interaction
with other proteins, small molecules and/or class molecules
(Fig. 1). Examples of processes which create a state include
phosphorylation, proteolysis, Guanosine triphosphate binding,
membrane localization, etc. Transient or ﬂeeting interactions like
non-speciﬁc binding are not included in state creation. Each state has
at least one reference, except a native state, showing experimental
evidence for its existence with a speciﬁc role in cellular processes.
In molecule pages, a state name follows a rigid set of rules (see
‘States’ section in Supplementary Material). Interacting proteins in
a state are separated by slashes (‘/’), bound ligands are connected
by hyphens and subcellular locations are included in parentheses.
For example: ‘ProA/ProB-P2 (nuc)’ represents Protein A bound to
Protein B, which has been phosphorylated twice and the state exists
in the nucleus.

2.2 State transitions

State transition occurs when a new state is created from the native
or previously created state by addition or removal of a covalent
modiﬁcation, association or dissociation of a protein, a small
molecule or a change in location (see ‘State transitions’ section in
Supplementary Material). One or more transitions can occur within
a pair of states and there can be multistep transitions between states.
Some transitions are associated with biological processes which are
caused by one or more catalysts, where a catalyst could be a state,
class molecule or a starting state with intrinsic enzyme activity (see
‘Enzyme function’ section in Supplementary Material). If, however,

it is caused by ligand binding, then the ligand-receptor details (see
‘Receptor function’ section in Supplementary Material) are included.

2.3 State functions

A state may associate with one or more of ﬁve different functions
depending on the protein ﬁinctional category (see ‘State functions’
section in Supplementary Material). The channel ﬁinction is deﬁned
with the channel ions, ionic conductance, channel blockers and
thermodynamic data on channel gating. Receptor function is deﬁned
with bound ligand and dissociation rates. For enzymes, functions
are represented for the catalysis with balanced chemical equations.
If known, kinetic data of the species for which data were measured
in vivo or in vitro are included. For transcription factors, bound
DNA sequences with target genes are provided. These functions may
overlap for a given protein state—for example, nuclear receptor may
function as receptor and transcription factor, receptor tyrosine kinase
may ﬁinction as an enzyme and as a receptor and some ligand-gated
channels are also associated with receptor function.

3 DATA EXPORT

The comparison of data availability between databases (Table 2)
highlights the necessity to integrate data through a common
platform. SGMP provides data export in various community
standardized formats such as SBML (Hucka et (11., 2003) and
BioPAX (Demir et (11., 2010) to facilitate integration of data from
disparate databases while using systems biology tools for analysis.
One such common use-case is to load a BioPAX ﬁle into Cytoscape
(Shannon et (11., 2003) for analysis (see ‘Data export’ section in
Supplementary Material). The data can also be exported in PDF
(see ‘PDF export’ section in Supplementary Material).

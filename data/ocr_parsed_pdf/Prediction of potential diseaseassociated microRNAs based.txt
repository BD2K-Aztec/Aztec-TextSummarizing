Abstract

Motivation: Identifying microRNAs associated with diseases (disease miRNAs) is helpful for
exploring the pathogenesis of diseases. Because miRNAs fulfill function via the regulation of their
target genes and because the current number of experimentally validated targets is insufficient,
some existing methods have inferred potential disease miRNAs based on the predicted targets. It
is difficult for these methods to achieve excellent performance due to the high false—positive and
false—negative rates for the target prediction results. Alternatively, several methods have con—
structed a network composed of miRNAs based on their associated diseases and have exploited
the information within the network to predict the disease miRNAs. However, these methods have
failed to take into account the prior information regarding the network nodes and the respective
local topological structures of the different categories of nodes. Therefore, it is essential to develop
a method that exploits the more useful information to predict reliable disease miRNA candidates.
Results: miRNAs with similar functions are normally associated with similar diseases and vice
versa. Therefore, the functional similarity between a pair of miRNAs is calculated based on their
associated diseases to construct a miRNA network. We present a new prediction method based on
random walk on the network. For the diseases with some known related miRNAs, the network
nodes are divided into labeled nodes and unlabeled nodes, and the transition matrices are estab—
lished for the two categories of nodes. Furthermore, different categories of nodes have different
transition weights. In this way, the prior information of nodes can be completely exploited.
Simultaneously, the various ranges of topologies around the different categories of nodes are
integrated. In addition, how far the walker can go away from the labeled nodes is controlled by re—
starting the walking. This is helpful for relieving the negative effect of noisy data. For the diseases
without any known related miRNAs, we extend the walking on a miRNA—disease bilayer network.
During the prediction process, the similarity between diseases, the similarity between miRNAs,
the known miRNA—disease associations and the topology information of the bilayer network are
exploited. Moreover, the importance of information from different layers of network is considered.
Our method achieves superior performance for 18 human diseases with AUC values ranging
from 0.786 to 0.945. Moreover, case studies on breast neoplasms, lung neoplasms, prostatic neo—
plasms and 32 diseases further confirm the ability of our method to discover potential disease
miRNAs.

1 Introduction

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non—coding RNAs that play im—
portant roles in gene regulation by targeting mRNAs for cleavage or
translational repression (Bartel, 2004; Chatterjee and Grobhans,
2009). Recently, accumulating evidence has indicated that miRNA
dysregulation is closely related to the development, progression and
prognosis of various human diseases (Alvarez—Garcia et al., 2005;
Lynam—Lennon et al., 2009; Meola et al., 2009). Therefore, identify—
ing the miRNAs associated with diseases (disease miRNAs) contrib—
utes to the exploration of the pathogenesis of diseases.

Recently, computational prediction methods have been used to ob—
tain reliable disease miRNA candidates for further experimental stud—
ies. Since miRNAs fulﬁll their functions via the regulation of target
mRNAs (target genes) expression, several methods based on the tar—
gets have been presented. Jiang et al. (20103) estimated the similarity
between miRNAs by measuring the similarity of their associated tar—
get genes. The miRNA network based on targets was combined with
a disease phenotype network to infer the correlation scores between
miRNAs and diseases. In addition, they improved the score calcula—
tion by further integrating the similarities of miRNAs with the pheno—
type similarities of diseases (Jiang et al., 2010b). Li et al. (2011) also
collected miRNA targets, and measured the function consistence score
(FCS) between the target genes and the disease—related genes.
However, when calculating the PCS, this method ignored the topo—
logical structure that is composed of the targets and disease genes.
Moreover, as the current number of targets that have been verified by
biological experiments is insufficient, both Jiang and Li obtained the
target genes by using target prediction programs, such as TargetScan
(Lewis et al., 2003) and PITA (Kertesz et al., 2007). Because these
programs have high false—positive and false—negative rates (Bartel,
2009; Liu et al., 2014; Ritchie et al., 2009), it is difficult for the meth—
ods based on targets to achieve high prediction performance. Shi et al.
(2013) exploited the functional link between miRNA targets and dis—
ease genes in protein—protein interaction network to identify miRNA—
disease associations. This method was also affected by the low accur—
acy of target prediction. In addition, it ignored the functional similar—
ity between genes.

It is well known that miRNAs with similar functions are nor—
mally implicated in similar diseases and vice versa (Bandyopadhyay
et al., 2010; Goh et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2008). Chen’s method (Chen
and Zhang, 2013) focused on the phenotype similarity between
diseases and the associations between miRNAs and diseases. For a
specific miRNA m,, the novel diseases that are similar to the known
mi—related diseases were obtained as mi—related candidates. Due to
not considering the similarity between miRNAs, this method could
not achieve excellent performance. As the functionally related
miRNAs tend to be associated with similar diseases, the functional
similarity of two miRNAs has been successfully estimated based on
the semantic similarities of their associated diseases (Wang et al.,
2010). HDMP integrated the functional similarities with the charac—
teristics of miRNAs to predict candidates associated with a given
disease (Xuan et al., 2013). It only considered the [2 most similar
neighbors of a candidate and ignored the topology formed by
the neighbors. To construct a miRNA network derived from

miRNA—associated diseases, the functional similarity between any
two miRNAs was used as the weight of edge connecting them. By
integrating known miRNA—disease associations, the similarity be—
tween diseases and the miRNA network, RLSMDA (Chen and Yan,
2014) developed the prediction method based on regularized least
squares to uncover potential miRNA candidates for a specific dis—
ease. RLSMDA achieved excellent prediction performance not only
for the diseases with some related miRNAs but also for the diseases
without any known related miRNAs. Unfortunately, it ignored the
topology information of the miRNA network. RWRMDA (Chen
et al., 2012) obtained the putative disease miRNAs that have similar
functions to known disease miRNAs via random walk through the
miRNA network. However, the network is composed of two catego—
ries of nodes. For a specific disease, some nodes are validated by bio—
logical experiments to be implicated in the disease, but the other
nodes have no evidence to verify their association with the disease.
Unfortunately, the prior information regarding the two categories of
nodes and their respective local topological structures are not con—
sidered. Therefore, we propose a novel prediction method based on
random walk, which exploits the characteristics of the nodes and
the various ranges of topologies. In addition, we extend the walk on
a miRNA—disease bilayer network to predict candidates specially for
the diseases without any known related miRNAs.

2 Methods

2.1 Process of predicting disease miRNAs

We model the prediction process as random walk on a miRNA net—
work derived from miRNA—associated diseases. Our method for
miRNAs associated with diseases prediction is referred to as MIDP.
For a specific disease d with some related miRNAs, a random walker
starts at one of known d—related miRNA nodes with equal probability.
If a neighbor of the current node is more likely to be associated with
d, the walker transmits to it with a greater proportion. After the itera—
tive walking process is converged, the steady—state probability with
which the walker stays at a candidate node (possible d—related
miRNA) is defined as its relevance score. In this way, the candidates
with higher scores are more likely to be associated with d.

For the disease d, the known d—related miRNAs, the d—related
miRNA candidates and their relationship form a network, which is
denoted as a weighted graph C(V, E, W). Each vertex (v E V) repre—
sents a d—related miRNA or a candidate. Each edge (e E E) captures
the relationship between the two vertices that are linked by edge e.
The weight w of e is set as the functional similarity which quantifies
the relationship. A greater w means that the two vertices are more
likely to be associated with a group of similar diseases.

In the network, the known d—related miRNAs are referred to as
the labeled nodes. The remaining miRNAs, which have no evidence
to verify that they are associated with d so far, are the unlabeled
nodes. Because the unlabeled nodes are probably associated with d,
the prediction goal is to rank all the unlabeled nodes and obtain the
potential disease miRNAs. In our method, we correlate an unlabeled
node 14,- with a relevance score RScore(u,-). A higher RScore(u,-) repre—
sents a more probable association between 14,- and d.

The process of predicting d—related miRNAs by MIDP is illus—
trated in Figure 1. First, the functional similarity of any two
miRNAs is calculated by measuring the semantic similarities of their
associated diseases. The miRNA network derived from miRNA—
associated diseases (Mnet) is constructed by defining the functional
similarity of two miRNAs as their edge weight. Second, we divide
the nodes within Mnet into labeled nodes and unlabeled nodes.
Based on the similarity between the nodes and the prior information
regarding the nodes, the transition matrix of the labeled nodes (M9)
and that of the unlabeled nodes (MU) are created. Third, we con—
struct a novel prediction model based on random walk to estimate
the relevance score between each unlabeled node and d. Finally, all
the unlabeled nodes are ranked by their scores, and the top ranked
nodes are selected as potential candidates.

2.2 Construction of Mnet
Accurate calculation of the functional similarity between miRNAs
is the basis for constructing Mnet. It has been observed that

miRNAs associated with similar diseases normally have similar
functions and vice versa (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2010; Goh et al.,
2007; Lu et al., 2008). Therefore, the functional similarity of two
miRNAs is successfully estimated by measuring the semantic simi—
larities of their associated diseases (Wang et al., 2010). For instance,
as shown in Figure 1, miRNA 11,, is associated with disease d1, d2, d3
and d4, and miRNA ﬂy is associated with d1, d3, d5, d6 and d8. Wang
et al. calculated the semantic similarity between {d1, d2, d3, d4} and
{d1, d3, d5, d6, d8} as the similarity of 11,, and ﬂy, denoted as
Sim(vx,vy).

However, when they calculated the similarity, Wang et al. ex—
tracted the disease information associated with the miRNAs from an
earlier version of the human miRNA—disease database (HMDD
released in September 2009, Lu et al., 2008). The latest version of
HMDD was released in June 2014 (Li et al., 2014). We recalculated
the similarity with the latest data. If the similarity of two miRNAs is
greater than 0, an edge is added to link them. Furthermore, the
weight of their edge is set as the similarity. Thus, Mnet (denoted as a
weighted graph G) is constructed.

2.3 Two one—step transition matrices

For a given disease d, the prediction of the d—related miRNAs is
modeled as random walk on the weighted graph G. A random
walker starts at the labeled nodes and walks around them. Assume
the walker stays at vertex 11,, now. As far as 11,, is concerned, if a
neighbor of 11,, is more likely to be associated with d, we make the
walker transmit to the neighbor with a higher probability.
Furthermore, the walker iteratively walks to sufficiently exploit the
topological structural information of graph C. After the iterative
walking process is converged, the steady—rate probability for a ver—
tex indicates the possibility that the walker will finally stay at the
vertex. A greater probability reveals a closer association relationship
between the vertex and d.

The key to our prediction model is to determine the one—step
transition probability of the walker. As far as a vertex (such as 11,-)
within graph G is concerned, if one of its neighbors (such as 11,) is
more likely to be associated with d, we assign 11,- with higher transi—
tion probability (m,,-). Therefore, the transition probability assign—
ment mainly includes two steps. First, we estimate the degree of
association (a,,-) between the neighbor 11,- and d with respect to 11,-.
Second, we make the transition probability m,,- proportional to a,,-.
The detailed probability assignment strategy is illustrated as follows.

The association matrix A(a,-,-)NxN is constructed first. 11,,- repre—
sents the degree of association between vertex 11,- and d, with respect
to 11,-. A greater 11,,- means a more probable association between 11,-
and d, and N is the number of vertices within graph G. The elements
of matrix A are then classified into the following four cases:

1. Assume Q is a set composed of all the labeled nodes and 11,- E Q.
As the neighbors of 11,- have similar function with 11,-, they are
likely to be associated with a group of similar diseases.
Therefore, if 11,- is associated with disease d, its neighbors are also
likely to be associated with d. For instance, as shown in
Figure 1, 117 is a labeled node (d—related miRNA) and 111 is one of
its neighbors. The higher the functional similarity between 117
and 111 [denoted as Sim(117,111)], the greater the association possi—
bility between 111 and d. In addition, the association possibility
when 117 is a labeled node, is greater than that when 117 is an un—
labeled node. Therefore, the former and the latter are multiplied
by 1119 and 111U, respectively. 1119 6 (0,1) represents the weight
of the association information from the labeled nodes, and 111U
6 (0,1) represents that from the unlabeled nodes. Obviously,
1119 is greater than 111U. Thus, with respect to 117, the degree of as—
sociation between 111 and d (1171) is set as Sim(117,111)-1119 :
0.71119. In this way, 1172, 1174, 1175 and 1176 are 0.61119, 0.71119,
0.71119 and 0.71119, respectively.

2. Assume U is a set composed of all the unlabeled nodes (possible
d—related miRNAs) and 11,- E U. As 11,- has similar function with
its neighbors, 11,- and its neighbors tend to be associated with
similar diseases. In other words, if 11,- is likely to be associated
with d, its neighbors are also likely to be associated with d. For
instance, 118 is an unlabeled node and it is possibly associated
with d. For one thing, the higher the functional similarity be—
tween 118 and its neighbor 113 [denoted as Sim(118,113)], the greater
the association possibility between 113 and d. For another,
the weight of the association information from the unlabeled
nodes is 111v. So as far as 118 is concerned, the association degree
between 113 and d (1183) is set as Sim(118,113)-111U:0.7111U. In this
way, 1184, 1186 and 1189 are 0.7111U, 0.8111U and 0.8111U, respectively.

3. If there is no edge between two miRNAs, such as 11,- and 11,, 11,,- is
set as 0. For instance, as 111 is not connected with 115, 1115 is 0.

4. The a value from a miRNA to itself, such as a,,-, is set as 0. For in—
stance, a11 is 0.

We can construct the association matrix A(a,-,-)NxN
according to the above rules. The formal definition of 11,,- is as
follows,

Sim(11,-,11,-)-1119, 11,- E Q, (11,,11,-) E E

Sim(11,-,11,-)-111U, 11,- E U, (11,,11,-) E E
417' I (1)
0, (UN/i) g E

07 U,‘ I U,‘

where 11,- is a vertex and 11,- is one of its neighbors.

Subsequently, assume that the walker stays at vertex 11,- now.
Here, 11,- might be a labeled node or an unlabeled node. To make the
probability of the walker reaching each its neighbors proportional
to the degree of association between the neighbor and d, we must
construct the transition matrix M (m,,-)NxN. Matrix A is row—normal—
ized by the following equation to obtain the one—step transition
probability matrix M(m,-,-)NxN.

N
mii : “ii/2417' (2)
[:1

m,,- represents the transition probability from 11,- to 11,-. Therefore, the
higher the degree of association between a neighbor of 11,- and d, the
greater the transition probability from 11,- to the neighbor. For ex—
ample, 113, 114, 117 and 118 are the neighbors of 116. As 116 is an unlabeled
node, and when only considering 115, the association degree between
its neighbors and d are 0.6111U, 0.6111U, 0.7111U and 0.8111U, respect—
ively. The transition probabilities are 0.222, 0.222, 0.259 and 0.296
after row—normalization.

However, after the rows of A are normalized, the weights (1119
and 111U) used to differentiate the association information from the
labeled nodes and the unlabeled nodes are lost. For example, when
normalizing the 6th row, the process of transforming 1163 into m63 is
as follows.

0.61111;
0.61111] + 0.61111] + 0.71111] + 0.81111]
9 0.6
_ 0.6 + 0.6 + 0.7 + 0.8

"163 I
(3)
: 0.222

No matter what the value of 111U is, its values in both the numer—
ator and the denominator can be removed. Therefore, the effect of
111U is lost. In addition, when normalizing the 5th row, the process of
transforming 1153 into m 53 is as follows.

0.61119
0.81119 + 0.61119 + 0.61119 + 0.71119

9 0.6
T 0.8 + 0.6 + 0.6 + 0.7

"153 I
(4)
: 0.222

In this way, the effect of 1119 is also lost. As a result, the inﬂuence of
the prior information as to whether a vertex is associated with d, is
ignored.

To solve this problem, we separate matrix M into two matrices,
M9 and MU. M9 represents the transition matrix of the labeled
nodes and My represents that of the unlabeled nodes. All the rows
of the labeled nodes in M9 are consistent with the corresponding
rows in M. The remaining rows of M9 are set as 0. In MU, all the
rows of unlabeled nodes are consistent with the corresponding rows
in M. The remaining rows are set as 0.

2.4 Establishing MIDP prediction model
Based on the transition matrices M9 and My, we can further estab—
lish the prediction model of MIDP as follows.

5(t + 1): rQMgSU) + p9(1 — rQ)X + rUM£5(t) + pU(1 — rU)X
(5)

First, 5(t+ 1) is a probability vector that indicates the walker ar—
rives at the ith vertex with the probability S,-(t+ 1) at time t+ 1.
Similarly, 5 (t) demonstrates the probability of arriving at each vertex
at time t. For a given disease d, since the vertices near the labeled
nodes are more likely to be associated with d than those near the un—
labeled nodes, a walker starts from a labeled node. 5(0) is the initial
probability vector that indicates the walker starts walking from one
of the labeled nodes with equal probability at time 0. The 1th elem—
ent of 5(0), 5,-(0), is set as follows.

Si(0):{1/Q ifvi E Q

_ (6 l
0 otherwzse

Second, to exploit the prior information, the labeled nodes and
the unlabeled nodes are assigned different weights, r9 (0 < r9 < 1)
and m (0 < m < 1). Furthermore, 19 is greater than my. Actually, 1’9
and n; have same functions as 1119 and 111U. They are used to tune
the weights of the association information from the labeled nodes
and the unlabeled nodes. The ultimate goal is to make the transition
probability proportional to the degree of association between each
neighboring vertex and d. For instance, the actual transition prob—
ability from labeled node 115 to 113 is r9-m53, and that from unlabeled
node 116 to 113 is rU-m63. The former is higher than the latter when
both m53 in M9 and m63 in MU are 0.222.

In addition, 19 and m also affect how far the walker can go
away from the labeled nodes and the unlabeled nodes. This means
that the greater the 19 (m), the wider the range of topology around
the labeled nodes (unlabeled nodes) involved in the walking process.
For instance, when considering (1920.4, rU:0.1) and (19:08,
my: 0.2), the proportion of 19er for both is 4:1. However, for the
latter, the walker can go farther from the labeled nodes (and un—
labeled nodes) than the former.

Third, if the walker locates a labeled node, it will return to the
starting vertices (labeled nodes) with the probability p9(1 —19) at
time t+ 1 and restart walking. 179 is the sum of the probability that
the walker arrives at each labeled node at time t. This can be defined

as,

pg 2 2 81(1) (7)
I/IEQ

In the same way, if the walker locates an unlabeled node, it will
go back to the starting vertices with the probability pU(1 — m) in the
next time. in; represents the sum of the probability that the walker
arrives each unlabeled node at time t, which equals 1 — 179. X is a
vector defining the nodes that are chose by the walker to go back
and restart walking. Since the walker restarts from one of the
labeled nodes, X equals 5(0).

The advantage of restarting walking is to control the overall de—
gree to which the walker can go far from the labeled nodes.
According to the above formula, the walker restarts walking with
the probability p9(1 — r9)+pU(1 — m). The closer to 0 the prob—
ability is, the more nodes around the labeled nodes the walker can
reach. If the probability is too small, the walker goes too far away
from the labeled nodes, which results in the inclusion of noisy data.
It is not helpful for improving the prediction performance. If the
probability is too great, there is not enough data to accurately

estimate the relevance score. Therefore, it is essential to select suit—
able values for 19 and m. In our experiments, 19 ranges from 0.9 to
0.1, and for a specific 19, m (m < r9) ranges from (19 — 0.1) to 0.1.
For instance, if 19 is 0.5, m is 0.4, 0.3, 0.2 or 0.1. Our prediction
model achieves the best performance when 19 : 0.4 and m : 0.1.

The walker starts from the labeled nodes and begins to walk it—
eratively. The iterative process stops when the convergence condi—
tion is satisfied. The convergence condition means that the L1—norm
between the two consecutive vectors, 5(t) and 5(t+ 1), is less than
10710. The steady—state probability with which the walker stays at
an unlabeled node, is defined as its relevance score. All the unlabeled
nodes are ranked by their scores. A higher score indicates a more
probable association between an unlabeled node and the given dis—
ease d. The algorithm for predicting d—related miRNAs by MIDP is
demonstrated in Figure 2.

2.5 Prediction based on the bilayer network

For the diseases with some known related miRNAs, cross—validation
(Section 3.3) demonstrates the superior performance of MIDP.
However, for the diseases without any known related miRNAs, al—
most all the previous methods and MIDP could not be applied to
them. To provide the potential miRNA candidates for them, we fur—
ther propose an extension method based on MIDP, referred to as
MIDPE.

MIDPE is also motivated by the observation that miRNAs with
similar functions tend to be associated with similar diseases and vice
versa. Besides Mnet, a network composed of diseases is exploited to
construct a miRNA—disease bilayer network. Given a specific disease
d without known related miRNAs, the walker starts from the node
d and walks on the bilayer network. If a disease node (d,) and the
node d are more possibly related with similar miRNAs, or a neigh—
bor (mi) of a miRNA node is more likely to associate with d, the
walker transmits to d,- or m,- with greater possibility. After the walk—
ing process is converged, the greater probability the walker arriving
at a miRNA node indicates the closer association between the
miRNA and d.

2.5.1 Construction of bilayer network and its association matrix
The miRNA—disease bilayer network is composed of the miRNA
network derived from the miRNA—associated diseases (Mnet), the
disease network (Dnet), and the edges between two networks. If a
miRNA has been verified to associate with a disease, an edge is
added to connect them. In Dnet, each node d,- represents a disease. If
the similarity between two nodes d,- and d,- is more than 0, an edge is
added to connect the two nodes. The weight of the edge between d,-
and d,- is set as the similarity between them. The disease similarity
was calculated in the same way as the literature (Wang et al., 2010).
Wang’s method represented a disease with a directed acyclic graph
(DAG), and the DAG contained all the annotation terms relative to
the disease. Furthermore, these annotation terms were obtained
from the US National Library of Medicine (MeSH, http://www.
nlm.nih.gov/mesh). The similarity between diseases was measured
based on their DAGs. When constructing the association matrix for
the bilayer network, the following three aspects should be
considered.

1. The similar diseases are more likely to associate with function—
ally related miRNAs. For instance, the disease node d1 in
Figure 3 has no any known associated miRNAs. Since d1 is simi—
lar to d2 and d2 has been associated with the miRNA m6, d1 is
possibly associated with m6. Furthermore, the greater similarity
between d1 and d2 means the more possible association between

d1 and ms. Therefore, assume ADD is the association matrix of
Dnet. (a,,-)DD is set as the similarity between diseases d,- and di.

2. The miRNAs with similar functions are more possibly related to
a group of similar diseases. Therefore, if there is an edge con—
necting a disease node and a miRNA node, the walker can jump
from Dnet to Mnet along the edge. Through walking on the
Mnet, the miRNAs associated with d1 can be further searched.
For example, the walker transmits from d1 to d2 and then jumps
to m6. Here, m6 has been inferred to probably associate with d1
in the last paragraph. Moreover, m6 and its neighbors (m2 and
m4) have similar functions. So m2 and m4 are also possibly asso—
ciated with d1. Therefore, the walker is allowed to jump from
Dnet to Mnet. ADM is a matrix indicating the jumping case. If
the disease node d,- is connected with the miRNA node mi,
(a,,-)DM is set as 1. Otherwise, it is set as 0.

3. During the process of walking on Mnet, if a neighbor (m2 or m4)
has greater functional similarity with the current node (m6), it
has higher possibility to associate with d1. Therefore, A MM de—
scribes the association matrix of Mnet and (a,,-)MM is set as the
similarity between m,- and m,.

At last, assume Mnet consists of N miRNAs and Dnet consists of
R diseases, and the association matrix of the bilayer network is AB.

2.5.2 Establishing MIDPE prediction model
For a random walk on the bilayer network, the transition matrix MB
is defined as follows,
Aim 0
MB 2 * (8)
“ADM (1—01) ED

where AIMM, A"D M, and A"DD are the matrices obtained by row—nor—
malizing AMM, ADM and ADD respectively. or controls the relative
importance of the information from Mnet or Dnet.

Based on the transition matrix M3, the prediction model of
MIDPE is defined as follows.

P(t+ 1) : (1 — v)M£P(t) + W 19>

Let P(t) be the probability distribution that the walker arrives at the
N + R nodes of the bilayer network at time t. It is defined as follows.
PM (t)

1’0) 2 PD“) (10)

The walker arrives at the ith miRNA node with the probability
PM,(t) and arrives at the ith diseases node with PD,-(t) at time t. As
the walker starts from a specific disease node, such as d,, only the ith
element of PD(0) is set as 1 and other elements are 0. Moreover, all
the elements of PM (0) are set as 0. Since the walker restarts from the
node d,, Y equals P(0). The restart probability y 6 (0,1) controls
how far the walker can go away from the starting node. After the
walking process is converged, the ith probability element of PM
with which the walker stays at m,, is defined as its relevance score.
Both or for adjusting the importance of network information and
the restart probability y range from 0.1 to 0.9. MIDPE achieved the
best prediction performance when or: 0.9 and y : 0.8. or: 0.9 indi—
cates that the information of Mnet accounts for the majority in predic—
tion process. It is consistent with that Mnet plays more important role
in the miRNA—disease association prediction (Chen and Yan, 2014).

3 Results

3.1 Data preparation
The human miRNA—disease database (HMDD) collected the experi—
mentally validated associations between miRNAs and diseases by

text mining (Li et al., 2014). For one thing, as done in previous stud—
ies (Wang et al., 2010; Chen and Yan, 2014), we merged different
miRNA—disease copies that produce the same mature miRNA. For
another, there are a few associations with irregular disease names
which are not included by the US. National Library of Medicine
(MeSH, http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh). After merging the redun—
dant data and eliminating the irregular data, the latest version of
HMDD (updated in June 2014) contains 5100 associations between
490 miRNAs and 326 diseases.

3.2 Evaluation of prediction performance

A specific disease d was used as a query to rank the d—related candi—
dates by their relevance scores. To evaluate the performance of
MIDP and other methods, fivefold cross—validation was performed.
In the fivefold cross—validation, the labeled nodes were randomly
divided into five subsets, four of which were used as known infor—
mation to predict potential candidates, while the omitted subset was
added to the d—related testing dataset as positive samples. The data—
set also consisted of all the unlabeled nodes (negative samples). The
relevance score of each node in the testing dataset was calculated,
and these nodes were ranked by their scores. The higher the positive
samples were ranked, the better the performance.

If a labeled node has higher score than a given threshold 0, it is
regarded as a successfully identified positive sample. If an unlabeled
node has a score lower than 0, it is regarded as a correctly identified
negative sample. By varying 0, the true positive rate (TPR) and the
false positive rate (FPR) were calculated to obtain the receiver oper—
ating characteristic (ROC) curves.

TP FP

TPR:— R:—
TP+FN’ TN+FP

(11)
TP and TN are the number of positive samples and the number
of negative samples that were correctly identified, respectively. FF
and EN are the number of positive samples and the number of nega—
tive samples that were identified incorrectly. The area under the
ROC curve (AUC) was used as the global prediction performance.

As the top portion of the prediction results is more important,
we measured the AUC within the top 30, 60, . .. , 210 and 240 can—
didates of the ranking list. In addition, we also reported the recall
rate, which measures how many positive samples are successfully
identified within the top [2.

In the latest association data of HMDD, as the majority of the
diseases were associated with only a few miRNAs, they were not
sufficient to evaluate the performance of the prediction methods.
Therefore, we tested 15 diseases associated with at least 80
miRNAs.

3.3 Comparison with other methods

RWRMDA (Chen et al., 2012), HDMP (Xuan et al., 2013),
RLSMDA (Chen and Yan, 2014), Shi’s method (Shi et al., 2013),
and Chen’s method (Chen and Zhang, 2013) are the—state—of—art
methods. According to the literatures, RWRMDA and HDMP have
achieved significantly better performance than Li’s method (Li et al.,
2011) and Jiang’s method (Jiang et al., 2010a). In addition, Shi’s
method concentrated on the functional links between miRNA tar—
gets and disease—related genes in PPI network. It exploited the inter—
actions between disease—related genes, the associations between
miRNAs and their targets and the protein interactions, which were
completely different from the datasets used in our method (MIDP).
Therefore, Shi’s method could not be compared with MIDP in a rea—
sonable and fair way. On the basis of this consideration, we

compared MIDP with RWRMDA, HDMP, RLSMDA and Chen’s
method.

As RWRMDA, HDMP and RLSMDA were developed based on
the association data in the earlier versions of HMDD, we imple—
mented these methods with the latest data. Specially, Chen’s method
focused on the earlier miRNA—disease associations and the pheno—
type similarity information between diseases. The disease names in
Chen’s method came from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in
Man (OMIM) database (Hamosh et al., 2005), while those in the as—
sociations of HMDD came from US. National Library of Medicine
(MeSH, http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh). Therefore, we firstly
mapped the disease names contained by HMDD into OMIM disease
names, and then updated Chen’s method with the latest association
data.

When analyzing all the methods, MIDP, RWRMDA, HDMP
and Chen’s method contained parameters that need to be fine—tuned.
The parameters 19 and m of MIDP were chosen from
{0.1,0.2,  ,0.9}. Furthermore, 19 should be greater than m. The
parameter r of RWRMDA ranged from 0.1 to 0.9. The parameter k
of HDMP varied from 1 to 50. The parameter r of Chen’s method
changed from 0.1 to 0.9. The results of each method that were pro—
duced by using the optimum parameters are illustrated in Table 1
and Figure 4 (r9 : 0.4 and m: 0.1 for MIDP, r: 0.9 for
RWRMDA, k : 20 for HDMP, r : 0.8 for Chen’s method). The de—
tailed parameter tuning for our method (MIDP) is demonstrated in
supplementary Figure S1.

As shown in Table 1, the average AUC values of MIDP,
RWRMDA, HDMP, RLSMDA and Chen’s method for all 15 dis—
eases, are 86.2, 79.9, 81.6, 82.6 and 65.2%, respectively. MIDP
achieved the best prediction performance, and its average AUC is
6.3, 4.6, 3.6 and 21% higher than other four methods, respectively.
Although RWRMDA, HDMP and RLSMDA also obtained high
performance, MIDP consistently outperformed them in all measures
for the 15 diseases. Chen’s method produced inferior result. The
possible reason is that Chen’s method ignored the similarity infor—
mation between miRNAs. Furthermore, the method strongly de—
pended on how much of the known disease information related to a
given miRNA. Currently, more than 30% of miRNAs are only asso—
ciated with 1—2 diseases. It is difficult to infer accurate disease candi—
dates for these miRNAs.

The results measured by AUC and recall within the top [2 candi—
dates are shown in Figures 5 and 6, respectively. MIDP also per—
formed the best for the top [2 ranking list, and ranked approximately
44% of positive testing samples in the top 30 and 86% in the top
120. HDMP ranked approximately 34% in the top 30 and 82% in
the top 120, which is not as high as MIDP but better than
RWRMDA. However, in the top 180, top 210 and top 240, HDMP
had lower recall values than RWRMDA. Similarly, RLSMDA
ranked 32.8% in the top 30, which is lower than HDMP.
Nevertheless, for the result from the top 60 to the top 240,
RLSMDA achieved higher recall values than HDMP. The possible
reason is that HDMP only considered the local information regard—
ing the [2 most similar neighbors. Therefore, the positive testing sam—
ples located in the neighborhood of the labeled nodes could be easily
identified, while it was difficult to discover those located far from
the labeled nodes. MIDP, RWRMDA, HDMP and RLSMDA
worked much better than Chen’s method because they exploited
multiple kinds of information of Mnet while Chen et al. ignored the
information.

In addition, a paired t—test was used to measure the statistical sig—
nificance that MIDP’s AUCs about multiple diseases were higher
than another method. The P—values are listed in Table 2. The results

value in the bracket is the area under MIDP's ROC curve for the specific
disease

confirmed that MIDP performed significantly better than the other
methods at the significance level 0.05.

To estimate the performance of MIDPE for the diseases without
any known related miRNAs, we implemented case studies for three
diseases including breast neoplasms (BN), colorectnal neoplasms
(CN) and bepatocellnlar carcinoma (HC). For a given disease d, we
removed all the known associations related to d. This operation
ensured that predicting d—related miRNA candidates only exploited

the information of Mnet. All the removed d—rated associations were
used as positive samples of the testing dataset.

In the previous methods, only RLSMDA can be applied to the
diseases without known related miRNAs. Therefore, MIDPE was
compared with RLSMDA. For BN, CN and H C, we removed 202
known BN—related miRNA—disease associations, 147 CN—related as—
sociations and 214 H C—related associations, respectively.

For MIDPE, AUC values corresponding to the 3 diseases are
0.821, 0.829 and 0.804. For RLSMDA, AUC values are 0.803,
0.812 and 0.789 (Fig. 7). MIDPE achieved slightly better perform—
ance than RLSMDA. The reason is that MIDPE additionally con—
sidered the topology between miRNA nodes in Mnet and that
between disease nodes in Dnet, relative to RLSMDA.

3.4 Case studies: BN, lung neoplasms, prostatic
neoplasms and 32 diseases

To further demonstrate MIDP’s ability for discovering potential
disease miRNA candidates, case studies of BN, lung neoplasms
and prostatic neoplasms were analyzed. We took the lung neo—
plasms—related candidates as examples and analyzed the top 50 can—
didates in detail.

First, we used miR2Disease database, which contains manually
curated miRNAs that have abnormal regulation in various human
diseases (Jiang et al., 2009). This database contains 3273 associ—
ations between 349 miRNAs and 163 diseases. As shown in Table 3,
9 of 50 candidates are included in miR2Disease, which indicates
their dysregulation in lung neoplasms. This confirms that they are
indeed associated with the disease.

Next, the database of differentially expressed miRNAs in human
cancers, dbDEMC (Yang et al., 2008), was constructed to provide
potential cancer—related miRNAs. With analysis of the microarray
datasets, dbDEMC identified 607 miRNAs which were more likely
to have different expression levels in 14 types of cancer when com—
pared with normal tissues. 31 of 50 candidates were contained by
dbDEMC, indicating that they are potentially upregulated or down—
regulated in lung cancer (malignant lung neoplasms).

In Table 3, there are 13 candidates labeled with ‘literature’ (for de—
tails see Supplementary Table S1). Several studies confirmed that 8 of
13 miRNAs are significantly upregulated or downregulated in human

was found to be associated with poor survival in lung adenocarcin—
omas of non—smokers (Jang et al., 2012). Hsa—mir—302a was identified
to regulate epidermal growth factor receptor which is frequently found
to be activated by mutation or amplification in lung cancer (Chan
et al., 2012). Furthermore, the down—regulation of hsa—mir—320a con—
tributes to the up—regulation of PFKm in lung cancer (Tang et al.,
2012). Hsa—mir—452 was significantly upregulated in current smokers
compared with former smokers (Mascaux et al., 2013). Hsa—mir—122
was upregulated in five of eight lung cancer patients after diagnosis
(Keller et al., 2011). The above analysis indicates that these five
miRNAs are likely to be associated with lung cancer as well.

Finally, we used PhenomiR, which is a systematic and manually
curated resource that demonstrates miRNA dysregulation in diseases

and biological processes (Ruepp et al., 2010). It recorded that hsa—mir—
92b and hsa—mir—449b had abnormal expression in lung cancer. Aside
from PhenomiR, GeneCards provides compendium for non—coding
RNA genes, including the miRNAs (Belinky et al., 2013). The associ—
ation between hsa—mir—211 and lung cancer has been contained by
GeneCards. In addition, it has been reported that miRNAs are often
found in genomic clusters (Baskerville et al., 2005). As the clustered
miRNAs are usually transcribed together and coordinately regulated,
they are more likely to associate with similar diseases (Wang et al.,
2010; Xuan et al., 2013). Hsa—mir—373 and hsa—mir—372 are clustered
within a 10—kb region on chromosome 19, and the latter has been asso—
ciated with lung cancer (Yu et al., 2008). This shows that the former is
likely to participate in the lung cancer—related biological process.

In terms of BN, the top 50 candidates are listed in Supplementary
Table S2. Two candidates were included by miR2disease. Seven candi—
dates were supported by the literature to have dysregulation in BN,
and four additional candidates were also supported by the literature
to be related to breast cancer—related proteins or transcription factors.
dbDEMC identified 37 candidates as potential upregulated or down—
regulated miRNAs in breast cancer (malignant BN). PhenomiR re—
ported that 1 candidate had abnormal expression in breast cancer.
The genes—to—systems breast cancer database (G2SBC) is usually used
for studying breast cancer (Mosca et al., 2010). Furthermore,
miRNAs execute their functions by regulating target genes. For 4 can—
didates, G2SBC showed that at least 1 1 of their top 100 predicted tar—
get genes were breast cancer—related genes.

In terms of prostatic neoplasms, the top 50 candidates are dem—
onstrated in Supplementary Table S3. Twelve candidates were
included by miR2disease. Eight candidates were supported by the
literature to be upregulated or downregulated in prostate neoplasms,
and five candidates were reported by the literature to have abnormal
expression in metastatic prostate cancer xenografts, relative to their
non—metastatic counterparts. dbDEMC identified 30 candidates as
potential miRNAs which have abnormal expression levels in pros—
tate cancer. PhenomiR reported that one candidate was overex—
pressed in prostate cancer. Three candidates were also ranked higher
by Li’s method, RWRMDA, and Jiang’s method, which indirectly
confirms that they are more likely to be associated with the disease.

In addition, as RLSMDA was applied to the 32 diseases without
any known related miRNAs, MIDPE also investigated these dis—
eases. In the top 3 potential miRNA candidates predicted by
MIDPE, 44 miRNA—disease associations were confirmed by the re—
cent literatures and 3 associations have been included by
miR2Disease (See supplementary Table S4). In summary, these case
studies demonstrate that both MIDP and MIDPE are powerful for
discovering potential disease miRNAs.

3.5 Predicting novel miRNA—disease associations

After the superior performance of MIDP and MIDPE was confirmed
by cross—validation and case studies, MIDP and MIDPE were further
applied to the diseases with known related miRNAs and those with—
out known related miRNAs, respectively. During the prediction pro—
cess, all known miRNA—disease associations were utilized to
construct the prediction model. All the potential disease miRNA
candidates were listed in supplementary table S5. MIDP and MIDPE
will be useful in generating reliable candidates for subsequent ex—
perimental research.

4 Conclusion

A new method based on random walk (MIDP) was developed to
predict potential miRNA candidates for the diseases with known

(1) ‘literaturel’ means that there is a literature to support that a miRNA is upregulated or downregulated in human lung neoplasm, as compared with normal
lung tissue. (2) ‘literaturez’ represents that a miRNA is related to some important factors affecting the development of lung neoplasms. (3) With analysis of the
microarray data sets, a miRNA is considered to potentially have different express levels in lung cancer when compared with normal tissues. This kind of miRNAs
is labeled by ‘dbDEMC’. (4) ‘miR2Disease’ means that a miRNA is included in the manually curated miRNA-disease association database, miR2Disease. (5)
‘PhenomiR’ means a miRNA has dysregulation expression in lung cancer. (6) GeneCards provides comprehensive information on all known human genes, includ—

ing miRNAs. ‘GeneCards’ means the database recorded that a miRNA was associated with lung cancer. (7) ‘cluster’ represents a miRNA and another miRNA are

clustered, and the latter was associated with lung neoplasms.

related miRNAs. We constructed the miRNA network derived from
miRNA—associated diseases to integrate the similarities between
nodes, the prior information of nodes, and the local topological
structure. Based on the characteristics of the labeled and unlabeled
nodes, their transition matrices were established. The transition
probability between the nodes was proportional to the similarity be—
tween them. The labeled nodes were assigned higher transition
weight than the unlabeled nodes, which efficiently exploited the
prior information of nodes and the various ranges of topologies. The
degree to which the walker could deviate from the labeled nodes
was controlled by restarting the walking. This effectively relieved
the negative effect of noisy data.

In addition, an extension method (MIDPE) was proposed specially
for the diseases without any known related miRNAs. The miRNA—dis—
ease bilayer network was constructed to integrate the information in
miRNA network derived from miRNA—associated diseases (Mnet)
and the information in disease network (Dnet). The transition matrix
for the bilayer network was constructed according to the association
degree between the miRNA node (or the disease node) and a given dis—
ease. At the same time, the information in Mnet and that in Dnet
were assigned different weights to balance their relative importance.
Similarly, the restart probability in the bilayer network controlled
how far the walker can go away from the starting node.

MIDP was compared with RWRMDA, HDMP, RLSMDA and
Chen’s method. IVIIDPE was compared with RLSMDA which was the
single method applied to the diseases without known related miRNAs
before. The results demonstrated that MIDP and MIDPE have super—
ior prediction performance. The cross—validation and the case studies

indicated that MIDP and MIDPE are powerful not only for capturing
known disease miRNAs but also for discovering potential candidates.
It will be useful for providing reliable candidates for future studies of
miRNA involvement in the pathogenesis of diseases.

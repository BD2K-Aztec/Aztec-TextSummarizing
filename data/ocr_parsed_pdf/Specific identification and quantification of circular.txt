Abstract

Motivation: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a poorly characterized class of molecules that have been
identified decades ago. Emerging high—throughput sequencing methods as well as first reports on
confirmed functions have sparked new interest in this RNA species. However, the computational
detection and quantification tools are still limited.

Results: We developed the software tandem, DCC and CircTest. DCC uses output from the STAR
read mapper to systematically detect back—splice junctions in next—generation sequencing data.
DCC applies a series of filters and integrates data across replicate sets to arrive at a precise list
of circRNA candidates. We assessed the detection performance of DCC on a newly generated
mouse brain data set and publicly available sequencing data. Our software achieves a much higher
precision than state—of—the—art competitors at similar sensitivity levels. Moreover, DCC estimates
circRNA versus host gene expression from counting junction and non—junction reads. These read
counts are finally used to test for host gene—independence of circRNA expression across different
experimental conditions by our R package CircTest. We demonstrate the benefits of this ap—
proach on previously reported age—dependent circRNAs in the fruit fly.

1 Introduction

 

CircRNAs are a recently rediscovered class of abundant and universally
expressed RNA species (Jeck and Sharpless, 2014). The development
of software solutions for detecting and quantifying circRNAs is slowly
gaining momentum despite the increasing interest in circRNAs.
CircRNAs are characterized by a back-splicing event where the down-
stream 3/ splicing ‘tail’ joins back with the upstream 5/ splicing ‘head’
to form a circular RNA structure (see Supplementary Fig. $1).
This structure becomes visible in sequencing data as ‘scrambled’ exons
as the co-linearity of genome and transcript is violated. However, the
existence of ‘back-splicing’ junction reads does not prove the circularity

of the transcript of origin. Other mechanisms (e.g. trans-splicing) may
yield such reads, but only circRNAs are depleted in polyA-enriched
samples and resistant to RNAse R treatment. So far, all available algo-
rithms are using these ‘back-splicing’ reads as a key element in
circRNA detection. As a consequence, detection performance heavily
depends on the employed read mapper and its ability to map circRNA
junction reads to the underlying genome or transcriptome. The two
most recent addition to the circRNA detection tool set are CIRI (Gao
et (11., 2015) and KNIFE (Szabo et (11., 2015). Other circRNA detecting
pipelines have been published along with research papers but seem to
perform worse than the two in the corresponding benchmarks.

Westholm et al. (2014) reported on relative circRNA expression
changes as measured by qPCR ratio for four selected genes. Three of
them (An/<2, scro, pIZOCtn) ranked top in our list of significant
host—independent circRNAs and CaMKI ranked 22th (Fig. 1B and
Supplementary Table S4). Our results show the same age—dependant
increase as in Westholm et al. (2014), Figure 7E.

3 Discussion

We present a software tandem for circRNA detection (DCC) and rela—
tive quantification (CircTest). We could show that DCC has a higher
precision than its competitors for single and paired—end data sets.
Moreover, we adapt a statistical framework based on the beta—binomial
distribution for identifying host gene independent changes in circRNA
expression. Additional information are provided in Supplementary Text.

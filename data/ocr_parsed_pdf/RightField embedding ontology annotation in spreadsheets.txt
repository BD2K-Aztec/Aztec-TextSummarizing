ABSTRACT

Motivation: In the Life Sciences, guidelines, checklists and
ontologies describing what metadata is required for the interpretation
and reuse of experimental data are emerging. Data producers,
however, may have little experience in the use of such standards
and require tools to support this form of data annotation.

Results: RightField is an open source application that provides
a mechanism for embedding ontology annotation support for Life
Science data in Excel spreadsheets. Individual cells, columns or
rows can be restricted to particular ranges of allowed classes
or instances from chosen ontologies. The RightField-enabled
spreadsheet presents selected ontology terms to the users as a
simple drop-down list, enabling scientists to consistently annotate
their data. The result is ‘semantic annotation by stealth’, with an
annotation process that is less error-prone, more efficient, and more
consistent with community standards.

a BSD license and freely available from http://www.rightfield.org.uk

1 INTRODUCTION

The quantity and complexity of biological data produced during
standard laboratory projects has increased with the availability
of high-throughput technologies. Advances in areas, such as,
transcriptomics and proteomics, enable scientists to produce high
volumes of data in single experiments. In order to compare and
reuse this data, however, rich metadata annotation is required.

The biocuration and data standards communities have been
addressing this issue by providing recommendations for annotation
requirements. Minimum information models (Taylor et al., 2008)
with associated controlled vocabularies or ontologies that deﬁne the
terms that should be used to describe metadata elements are being
developed. In some cases, publication submissions are not accepted
unless the accompanying data is compliant with the relevant
minimum information model (for microarrays, this is MIAME, the
Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment). However,
despite this drive to standardization, there are few tools to help
scientists manage this process. RightField was created to allow
data curators (informaticians and ontologists) to augment standards

compliant spreadsheet templates with embedded ontology term
selection. Once a RightField-enabled template has been prepared,
laboratory scientists can use it in its native form to annotate their
data using simple drop-down boxes.

RightField was produced by the SysMO-DB project. SysMO-
DB is developing a platform for data management and exchange
in Systems Biology, primarily for the pan-European SysMO
consortium (Systems Biology of Micro-Organisms). SysMO-
DB supports a consortium of over 300 scientists, from a
variety of Life Science backgrounds, with little experience of
metadata management, ontologies and standardization. Data is
standardized by developing spreadsheet templates for different
types of experiment and embedding ontology term selection, using
RightField, within these templates. The combination of templates
and RightField, provides an infrastructure that promotes and
encourages compliance and consistent data annotation.

2 DATA ANNOTATION AND REUSE

RightField is an application developed to operate within
spreadsheets since spreadsheet use is ubiquitous in laboratory
sciences.

To use RightField, curators either upload an existing Excel
spreadsheet, or create metadata entries in a new sheet. When the
structure of the template is ﬁxed, ranges of ontology terms can
be embedded by either uploading ontologies from the BioPortal
(Noy et al., 2009), or from a local ﬁle in OWL, OBO, RDFS or
RDF formats, Figure 1 shows a template being marked-up using
RightField.

Individual cells, whole columns or whole rows can be marked up
with the required ranges of ontology terms. For example, they could
include all subclasses from a chosen class, direct subclasses only,
all individuals, or only direct individuals. Each spreadsheet can be
annotated with terms from multiple ontologies.

RightField is intended for use by informaticians and ontologists
because setting up templates requires some knowledge of which
ontologies to use and when. The spreadsheets, however, are intended
for use by laboratory scientists as well as informaticians. Once
templates are marked-up and saved, users only interact with them
in the native spreadsheet form.

RightField-enabled spreadsheets display simple drop-down lists
of terms in any marked-up cells (Fig. 2). Users of the spreadsheet
are restricted to select from the term labels in the dropdown
boxes, but no information from the ontology is lost. The terms
displayed are linked to encapsulated hidden sheets that contain

the ﬁill Intemationalized Resource Identiﬁers (IRIs) for each term.
Ontology IRIs must be captured as they are vital for data provenance
and for extracting and processing data from the spreadsheets, but
they do not need to be shown to users. Future versions will
allow users to switch between labels and identiﬁers, providing an
alternative informatics View. To view information in the hidden
sheets, spreadsheets can be uploaded into the RightField Inspector
application (http://inspect.rightﬁeld.org.uk/).

The encapsulation of ontology information into the spreadsheet is
crucial. It allows users to complete annotation ofﬂine when required
and it ensures that a series of experiments can be annotated with the
same versions of the same ontologies, even if the live ontologies
change during this time. If users wish to update to a new version,
the spreadsheet must be edited in RightField.

The recommended operational protocol is that RightField-enabled
templates are created before a series of experiments, so that
laboratory scientists can select metadata descriptions as and when
they perform the experiments.

RightField is in use in the SysMO consortium. Examples can
be found at http://www.rightﬁeld.org.uk. As anticipated, RightField-
enabled spreadsheets showed a marked increase in the consistency of
annotation and the majority of SysMO evaluators found RightField
useful.

The use of RightField, however, highlighted a wider issue with
the structure of annotation ontologies. Some ontologies have shallow
hierarchies. If users are expected to make a choice from a long list

of classes (or individuals) in order to follow a community standard,
perhaps this is an indication that a particular area of the ontology
requires ﬁirther development. RightField can address this issue from
a technical perspective by providing auto-complete ﬁmctionality
for marked-up cells, but standardization should be encouraged by
making the process straightforward. Deﬁning more speciﬁc classes
and/or splitting individuals between them would be of beneﬁt to the
whole community of ontology users.

3 RIGHTFIELD IMPLEMENTATION

RightField is an open-source, cross-platform Java application. It
combines the use of the Apache POI library to read and manipulate
spreadsheets and the Protege OWL API to read and process ontology
ﬁles. When a set of ontology terms are applied to cells, the identiﬁers
and label for these elements of the ontology are stored within
a hidden sheet in the spreadsheet ﬁle. The terms are applied to
cells using data validation as provided by Apache POI. RightField-
enabled spreadsheets can be opened in Microsoft Excel or in Open
Ofﬁce.

4 DISCUSSION

RightField provides a simple and unobtrusive way of using semantic
web technologies to improve and standardize data annotation. The
novel part of this work lies in shielding the use of ontologies
from laboratory scientists, allowing them to continue working in
familiar native spreadsheets. Other applications, such as the ISA
Tools (Rocca-Serra et (11., 2010), provide similar functionality, but
operate from bespoke client applications and are designed for more
expert users. The Anzo commercial platform has similar goals
(http://www.cambridgesemantics.com/).

The introduction of high-throughput, omics technologies has
revolutionized experimental biology. The data produced in these
experiments, however, is difﬁcult to interpret or reuse without the use
of common vocabularies. RightField is an application that bridges
this gap. It restricts the choices of annotation terms to a manageable
set, which is accessible and understandable to the scientists. It also
lays the foundations for the structured extraction of spreadsheet data
into Resource Description Framework (RDF) and Open linked Data
(http://linkeddata.org/).

Ongoing development in RightField will explore the issues
surrounding structured data extraction and greater validation of
supplied annotations.

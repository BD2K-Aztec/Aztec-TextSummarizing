Mallet et al., 2010; Podell and Gaasterland, 2007). To date, the
effort in eukaryotic genomes has been demonstrated consistently
to fail on these criteria due to the genome heterogeneity in eu—
karyotes (Mallet et al., 2010), thus leading to the need for an
expanding reference database for comparative analyses.

We show here, however, that genome complexity may be over—
come by carefully examining the pattern of genomic signature
along a sequence. We use both the selection of tetranucleotides
with greatest interspecif1c variability in their frequencies and
local composition shifts that take into account natural variation
of tetranucleotide frequency changes along a chromosomal arm
to locate regions that differ and might thus represent recent ac—
quisitions via HGT.

2 ALGORITHM

2.1 Calculation of 4-mer sliding density

The principle of the SigHunt (genomic signature hunter) method
is to use a sliding window approach both to detect the HGT and
to take into account DNA sequence composition change along
chromosomes. The genomic signature is calculated as a fre—
quency vector of tetranucleotides (4—mer) within the window of
a genomic sequence. Within each sliding window, frequency of
every 4—mer is calculated as

Cm(5)

Fm(S):NS_3

 

where Fm(S) is the frequency of the 4—mer m within a sequence in
the sliding window (S), C,,,(S) is the count of m in S and N S is the
length of the sequence in the window S. Only fully resolved sites
are counted towards Fm(S). Tetranucleotides that contain an un—
resolved base are omitted. Unresolved sites are skipped, and the
length of the window, but not the length of the sequence, is
increased by the given number of nucleotides until it reaches
20% of the window size. This is the maximum extension of the
window. There are two reasons for choosing oligonucleotide
length. First, 4—mers provide a vector with a number of dimen—
sions sufﬁcient for complex comparisons. Second, the 4—mers
frequency vector is representative even for relatively short sliding
windows, which is of interest in cases when short alien genes
could be expected.

Along a chromosomal sequence, DNA base composition
changes with functional regions, such as coding and non—
coding regions, repetitive elements, telomeres, centromeres or
other structural elements that stabilize a chromosomal arm.
Differences between repetitive and coding regions in particular
are prone to variable frequency of a few 4—mers that could either
distort or inform a signal from alien fragments. To account for
this, we develop a novel scoring system and introduce a sliding—
density concept. This takes into account genomic regions D that
are directly adjacent to the sliding window S, offset at the 5/ and
3/ ends of the sequence. Within the long sliding window of D, we
calculate a kernel density estimate for each 4—mer. The measured
4—mer frequency in the short sliding window of sequence S is
tested for whether or not it is located outside of the credibility
interval (CI) of the 4—mer density in D

we<o,¢sl<%>>u<¢sl<l—%>A>

where (DD is a cumulative distribution function of Fm(S) in D and
a is a conﬁdence level. Values found to be outside of the CI are
scored in three intervals for a e {0.05, 0.025,0.01}, adding 1, 2
and 3, respectively, to the discrete interval accumulative score
(DIAS). To avoid autocorrelation in measuring Fm(S) on D, D
is selected in such a way that S and a speciﬁed number of its
surrounding sliding windows (x) are excluded from the 4—mer
density calculation (eye—of—the—storm approach). Thus, we com—
pare the S sequence to its context but not to its immediate sur—
roundings. To compare the sliding window approach to previous
genome—wide signature studies, we also show global 4—mer
density.

DIAS measures how many 4—mers deviate in their frequency
from the local background of the genomic sequence and by how
much. While this is more stable along a chromosome than any
other compositional measure known to us, it is nevertheless sen—
sitive to local changes.

2.2 Selection of informative 4-mers

To further improve computational speed of the SigHunt method,
informative 4—mers can be selected to reduce the signal—to—noise
ratio. Multiple genomes are used to train the procedure for 4—mer
selection based on their intra— and inter—genomic variability.
Fm(S) values for all consecutive windows are used to calculate
the 4—mer density in a given chromosome. All chromosomes are
used for the training genomes. Informative 4—mers are selected as
those where means of Fm in organisms are distinctive from the
overall estimates and within—genome Fm variance is small. We
score the 4—mers using the tetranucleotide quality score (TES) for
each 4—mer

where n is the number of all organisms used for training, c is the
number of chromosomes in the given organism, u,- is mean 4—mer
frequency on the given chromosome [m = (Fm(S))’.], K is the
average of all mean frequencies of the given 4—mer on all tested
chromosomes in all organisms within the dataset, 0 denotes re—
spective variances and e is the estimated organism intended for
the SigHunt search.

Using TES, we are interested to learn the extent to which
4—mer frequencies vary between organisms with respect to their
variability within a genome. To achieve this, K estimates average
frequency of a 4—mer that is found in the given organism. It is
calculated as a mean of means to avoid weighting of the value
according to the number and size of chromosomes. A sums

for HGT. We searched for consistency of speciﬁc sequences in
Aspergillus, Saccharomyces, Pyrenophora, Galdieria and
Cryptosporidium between SigHunt and published results.
Compared with the extent of HGT identiﬁed in previous studies
that used predominantly comparative methods on annotated
genes, SigHunt found from 30% (Cryptosporidium) to 80%
(Aspergillus) of previously identiﬁed GIs (Table 2). In
Aspergillus, we were able to ﬁnd the majority of published GIs
as per Mallet et a]. (2010), which can be expected given that those
authors used a surrogate method veriﬁed with phylogenetic com—
parison to localize GIs. We identiﬁed 5 of 10 putative GIs recog—
nized in Saccharomyces by Hall et a]. (2005). The missed GIs
were protein—coding genes <1.2 kb, for which our chosen window
size might not be optimal. In Pyrenophora, we searched for 17

genes and 6 were retrieved by SigHunt. HGT in Galdieria can be
attributed to ~9% of the genomic sequence in the longest scaf—
folds, which we analysed (Schonknecht et al., 2013). SigHunt was
able to recognize the genomic signatures of the published GIs as
being alien in 61% of the cases. In Cryptosporidium, we found 9
of 30 previously identified GIs (Huang et al., 2004). As in pre—
vious cases with low success, the GIs in Cryptosporidium that
were missed consisted predominantly of short genes. In
these cases, experimentation with window size would be bene—
ficial. INDeGeNIUS found more known GIs in Aspergillus,
Pyrenophora and Cryptosporidium, but the analyses took an
order of magnitude longer than in SigHunt. SigHunt outper—
formed Alien_Hunter in recognizing the previously established
HGT events in most tested organisms. The exception

was Cryptosporidium, where Alien_Hunter found 11 of 30
GIs (Table 2).

5 DISCUSSION

We present here a tool for identifying genomic regions as candi—
dates for HGT assessment in eukaryotes. To our knowledge, this
is the first surrogate method primarily optimized for eukaryotic
genomes. It detects non—ameliorated HGT in large genomic se—
quences, it is computationally efﬁcient and its implementation
provides step—wise user access to results that enables data explor—
ation and analytical optimization.

We demonstrated good success in using SigHunt to find intro—
duced GIs across kingdoms and GIs in real genomic sequences
(particularly in some fungi). Considering from a biological per—
spective reproduction within this group, HGT might be more
common in fungi than in other eukaryotes (Rosewich and
Kistler, 2000). With HGT events being relatively common
within the group, one could speculate that some of these will
be non—ameliorated and thus easily detectable using surrogate
methods. The further example of Galdieria, within which GIs
were plentiful across the genome, seems to corroborate this.

5.1 SigHunt’s advantages

The advantage of SigHunt lies in its utilization of informative
4—mers. Selecting only parts of the genomic signature that are
most informative according to TES reduces noise in the data
and computational requirements, thereby speeding up the ana—
lysis. Computational demands are not negligible in eukaryotic
genomics. For example, INDeGeNIUS analysis of the largest
chromosome in Drosophila would require 870 TB of memory,
which is beyond the capacity available to many researchers,
including our group, and the current version of the program
does not allow for changes in memory use. By contrast,
SigHunt analysed the same problem using 900 MB of maximum
allocated memory. At a given time, SigHunt stores in memory
only that chromosome sequence needed to calculate the signa—
tures, or, once the corresponding signatures are calculated and
the chromosome sequence deleted from memory, the signatures
and densities themselves. Such orderly memory utilization re—
duces the memory requirements and thus allows computations
of even large datasets on regular office computers.

Contrary to other recent methods that use a genomic signature
for HGT detection (Elhai et al., 2012; Shrivastava et al., 2010;
but see Mallet et al., 2010), SigHunt does not assume a point
estimate of the genomic signature. Instead, it uses a density dis—
tribution and thus acknowledges the natural variability of DNA
composition and distinguishes only those regions that deviate
from the broad ‘norm’ for an organism. We recognize that the
density distributions must contain tails even for home signatures.
Due to this, DIAS measures accumulations of deviant 4—mer
frequencies rather than their mere occurrence. With sliding dens—
ity and its eye—of—the—storm variant that avoids autocorrelation,
SigHunt is able to ﬁnd putative GIs in any region of the chromo—
some. This includes regions rich in repetitive DNA because
SigHunt assumes a differing genomic signature typical for a gen—
omic region rather than for the whole chromosome.

SigHunt makes it unnecessary to have knowledge as to the
exact position on a chromosome of the examined sequence
(Podell and Gaasterland, 2007). It can successfully analyse unas—
sembled genomes, provided that the supercontigs are sufﬁciently
long. It also does not require information about gene locations.
By ﬁltering nucleotide positions in a sequence that are not fully
resolved, we limit the amount of information while increasing the
accuracy. In case of a long eukaryotic genome, a trade—off in
favour of accuracy is paramount for SigHunt.

5.2 SigHunt’s disadvantages

Unfortunately, SigHunt is not a universal black box solution for
all HGT problems. Its very principle denies universality, as it
rises and falls on the assumption that there are differences in
oligonucleotide frequencies between organisms (Karlin and
Burge, 1995). This is not always sufﬁciently true, as shown by
our analyses on manipulated and real data. Some random islands
were undifferentiated from the home signature. For others, the
GI size in real datasets might have been too small to accurately
estimate the 4—mer frequency density for the DIAS calculation. In
addition to reasons of there being similar genomic signatures
among the organisms involved, SigHunt is prone to false nega—
tives due to amelioration over time of the compositional bias in
the horizontally transferred region compared with the host
genome. The false—positive rate might also be increased. In re—
gions with strong selection bias and functional restrictions, home
signature might vary locally. The extent to which this is the case
remains to be tested.

SigHunt expands the search for GIs across the genome with—
out annotation limitations, yet it is able to guide the comparative
search more effectively than do other similar methods. We have
shown that SigHunt provides a fair basis of target regions for
comparative assessment that consists of true GIs as conﬁrmed by
phylogenetic analyses in the published data (Friesen et al., 2006;
Hall et al., 2005; Huang et al., 2004; Mallet et al., 2010;
Schonknecht et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2013).

5.3 Global density paradox

We claim that the advantage of SigHunt lies in its ability to
account for variation of the genomic signature along a chromo—
somal sequence. Yet, in Table 1, the sensitivity and speciﬁcity test
shows the highest (albeit not statistically signiﬁcant) AUC values
to be for the global density estimate in six cases. This is probably
caused by the fact that we introduced HGT directly between
organisms that spanned kingdoms and our islands were thus
devoid of any amelioration. In other words, while one would
rarely encounter such an event in practice, it is one that is rela—
tively easy to capture by means of genomic signatures. Analysing
real biological data would require a more subtle approach.
Therefore, both the sliding density and its eye—of—the—storm vari—
ant provide room for ﬁne—tuning the method. These are para—
meterized for window size, sliding window size, sliding—density
window size, and eye—of—the—storm size. All these parameters
might be optimized to further improve SigHunt for any speciﬁc
target organism. On the other hand, the global density reached
the height of its performance in this study. We nevertheless con—
sider global—density DIAS calculation a useful approach in view

of the fact that it is computationally effective and has low
memory demands.

5.4 Usefulness of SigHunt

As a method for investigating genomic signature in complex eu—
karyotic genomes, SigHunt can provide a rapid analysis tool for
ongoing sequencing projects. In particular, it will be sensitive to
recent HGT, such as in cases of emergent pathogens that have
acquired novel genes. The choice of informative 4—mers could
increase resolution and success for binning of metagenomic
DNA fragments (Saeed and Halgamuge, 2009). With the
recent ﬁnding of bacterial horizontally transferred genes in
human tumour cells (Riley et al., 2013), SigHunt shows promise
to be used in rapid screening of such events in genomic assem—
blies of speciﬁc cell lines. We assume that further research will
reveal more ﬁelds within which sliding density of DNA compos—
ition in eukaryotic genomes and the selection of informative
oligonucleotides will prove advantageous.

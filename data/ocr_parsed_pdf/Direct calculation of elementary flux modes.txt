ABSTRACT

Motivation: The concept of Elementary Flux Mode (EFM) has been
widely used for the past 20 years. However, its application to genome-
scale metabolic networks (GSMNs) is still under development because
of methodological limitations. Therefore, novel approaches are de-
manded to extend the application of EFMs. A novel family of methods
based on optimization is emerging that provides us with a subset of
EFMs. Because the calculation of the whole set of EFMs goes beyond
our capacity, performing a selective search is a proper strategy.
Results: Here, we present a novel mathematical approach calculating
EFMs fulfilling additional linear constraints. We validated our approach
based on two metabolic networks in which all the EFMs can be ob-
tained. Finally, we analyzed the performance of our methodology in
the GSMN of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by calculating
EFMs producing ethanol with a given minimum carbon yield. Overall,
this new approach opens new avenues for the calculation of EFMs in
GSMNs.

1 INTRODUCTION

From its inception, classical biology has relied on reductionist
principles. However, the actual nature of the cell, in which all
components interact, demanded switching the previous paradigm
to a holistic molecular approach, extending the scope of the ana-
lysis. These are the foundations that motivated the development
of systems biology in the second half of the twentieth century. In
particular, systems biology aims at studying the biological pro-
cesses in terms of the cellular components and their interactions
from a holistic molecular perspective (Kitano, 2002).

Some of these components interact in the cellular metabolism,
which comprises those biochemical reactions consuming and
producing the smallest compounds of the cell, typically named
metabolites. These reactions are close to be in thermodynamic
equilibrium, requiring the presence of catalytic agents so as to
achieve the appropriate rate of activity to sustain life. In most

metabolic reactions, a set of proteins named enzymes act as cata-
lysts. The conversion rate of the metabolic reactions is termed
metabolic ﬂuxes.

Metabolic reactions are organized into distinct functional
modules, forming the so-called metabolic pathways. Some of
these pathways have been experimentally reported and manually
included in different databases (Kanehisa et al., 2012; Keseler
et al., 2011), as well as in biochemistry books (Nelson and
Cox, 2000), e. g. glycolysis, TCA cycle. However, metabolic path-
ways are not independent entities; for example, the same enzyme
or metabolite may appear in different pathways. For this reason,
a most general analysis of metabolism requires the simultaneous
consideration of different metabolic pathways. In the most ex-
treme scenario, when all the known metabolic pathways are con-
sidered, the resulting set of enzymes and metabolites is referred
to as genome-scale metabolic networks (GSMNs). The outbreak
of different high-throughput experimental techniques has
allowed us to increase the accuracy and size of GSMNs, in
terms of metabolites, reactions and gene regulation. Currently,
GSMNs for several organisms are publicly available through
different online repositories (Schellenberger et al., 2010).

The inherent complexity of GSMNs does not make it possible
to perform a manual analysis per se. Different computational
strategies have been developed (Planes and Beasley, 2008).
Among them, a number of theoretical frameworks have been
proposed to extend the concept of metabolic pathways from a
network-oriented perspective (de Figueiredo et al., 2009; Pey
et al., 2011, 2013). One of the most important pathway concepts
is that of Elementary Flux Mode (EFM) (Schuster et al., 2000).
EFMs are a minimum set of enzymes necessary to accomplish
mass-balance and thermodynamic (irreversibility) conditions
(Schuster et al., 2000). Although the mass-balance and thermo-
dynamic constraints are directly imposed by means of two linear
constraints, the condition that guarantees that only a minimum
number of reactions is active, referred to as the non-decomposa-
bility condition (NDC), is more difﬁcult and demands further
mathematical considerations.

Efﬁcient algebraic frameworks can be found in the literature
for calculating the whole set of EFMs of a given metabolic net-
work. These methods are based on an iterative process that has
to be completed so as to guarantee that the obtained solutions
are EFMs. However, the number of EFMs increases exponen-
tially with the number of reactions constituting the network
(Acuﬁa et al., 2010). Consequently, applying these methodolo-
gies to GSMNs goes beyond their scope. Because it is not
possible to calculate all the EFMs in GSMNs, different math-
ematical frameworks were later developed to provide a particular

subset of them (de Figueiredo et al., 2009; Machado et al., 2012;
Rezola et al., 2013), most of them based on Mixed Integer Linear
Programming (MILP).

These optimization methods typically enumerate EFMs in an
increasing number of reactions and have been proved effective
for a number of applications (Rezola et al., 2013, 2014).
However, they allow us to add only one biological constraint
in the search procedure, e.g. computing the 100 shortest EFMs
producing L-lysine, as stated by de Figueiredo et a]. (2009). This
limitation is due to NDC. In other words, currently in the litera-
ture, there is no general methodology for taking into account
more than one biological constraint in the EFM computation
without violating NDC.

In this work, we present a novel approach based on MILP that
is able to calculate a subset of EFMs fulﬁlling additional con-
straints. The framework is illustrated with a toy example and
validated with two networks (Rezola et al., 2011; Schuster
et al., 2000), where all EFMs can be obtained. Subsequently,
the scalability of our approach is confirmed by calculating a
subset of EFMs in the genome-scale metabolic network of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Heavner et al., 2012). Here, we inves-
tigated EFMs simultaneously consuming glucose and producing
ethanol, guaranteeing that a minimum yield is achieved. We also
validated the performance of this new approach when more than
two constraints are imposed, particularly by calculating 100
EFMs activating a random set of five reactions.

2 METHODS

Here, we introduce an MILP that allows us to calculate a subset of EFMs
satisfying several biological constraints. At the end of the Section, the
methodology is illustrated with a toy example.

As discussed earlier, an EFM is a minimum set of enzymes necessary
to fulﬁll mass-balance and thermodynamic constraints. Although the last
two conditions can be imposed by means of linear equations, the ﬁrst one,
referred to as the NDC, requires further considerations. In particular, a
solution fulﬁlls NDC if no subset of its active reactions can satisfy the
mass-balance and thermodynamic constraints.

2.1 Mass-balance and thermodynamic constraints

Assume a metabolic network comprising C compounds and R reactions.

For each reaction r (r = 1,. . . ,R), we assigned a continuous ﬂux variable
v, representing its activity. These activities are included in the ﬂux vector
v=[v1, . . . , vR].

EFMs assume that the concentration of the so-called internal metab-
olites (I) remains constant over time (steady-state condition). This is rep-
resented by Equation (l), where Sc, is the stoichiometric coefﬁcient
associated with metabolite c (c=1,...,C) in reaction r (r=I,. . . ,R).
Note here that substrates have a negative stoichiometric coefficient,
whereas products have a positive stoichiometric coefﬁcient. These coefﬁ-
cients are grouped into the stoichiometric matrix (S). The steady-state
condition provides as many linear constraints as internal metabolites pre-
sent in the metabolic network under study.

In addition, EFMs must satisfy thermodynamic constraints associated

with irreversible reactions, which can perform only in one direction.
As typically done in the literature (Pey et al., 2011; Rezola et al., 2013),

we count two irreversible steps for each reversible reaction. Therefore, all
ﬂuxes are non-negative:

v, :0,r=1,...,R (2)

With this transformation, the solution space deﬁned by Equation (1)
and (2) becomes a pointed polyhedral cone, P.

2.2 NDC

As discussed elsewhere in the literature, e.g. Larhlimi and Bockmayr
(2009), if spurious cycles are neglected, the extreme rays in P are precisely
the EFMs of a network under consideration. Note that this claim holds
when reversible reactions are divided into two irreversible steps (Rezola
et al., 2011), as done precisely in Equation (2). For this reason, methods
aiming to determine the full set of EFMs are based on algorithms to
calculate extreme rays in a pointed polyhedral cone, such as the double
description method (Terzer and Stelling, 2008). Our approach presented
here is substantially different, as it relies on extreme points in a polytope
and linear programming, as detailed later.

To convert P into a polytope, we include an additional linear con-
straint, as observed in Equation (3). Note that bTe [RR and ce [R are
known. This generic linear inequality can be used, for example, to force
the activation of at least a reaction in a given set F; see Equation (4).

Z v, 3 1 (4)
rEF

With the additional constraint in Equation (3), extreme rays in P are
intersected and become extreme points of a polytope, as observed in
Figure 1B. Therefore, EFMs now correspond to the extreme points in
the feasible region deﬁned by (l)—(3). Building a search procedure for
EFMs based on extreme points is a powerful strategy and has been ex-
ploited previously (Kaleta et al., 2009), as highly developed algorithms for
linear programming can be found in the literature, such as the Simplex
algorithm (Dantzig et al., 1955), which provides an extreme point as an
optimal solution. Our goal here is different, as we aim to search for EFMs
that satisfy different biological constraints and, therefore, the theoretical
background needs to be extended.

Let us now consider the mathematical properties of extreme points in
the feasible region by (l)—(3) and EFMs. To that end, we ﬁrst deﬁne S* as
the matrix grouping S with bT, as shown below:

Without the abuse of notation, we introduce the operator 1' actuating in
a given matrix, which represents the submatrix involving the columns
corresponding to the active reactions in the solution 1'.

Considering that the solution 1' is an extreme point of (1)—(3) and
therefore, an EFM, the null space of matrix S? has zero degrees of free-
dom (df), as the solution 1' is the geometric intersection of an extreme ray
in P and the hyperplane in (3). On the other hand, because removing (3)
from S? always reduces its rank in a unit, the null space of S,- has one df.

Two proofs can be found in the Supplementary Material reinforcing
the relationship between extreme points and EFMs. In particular, we
show that (i) if NDC is satisﬁed in solution 1', S,- has one df, and (ii) if
S,- has one df, NDC is satisﬁed and therefore, solution 1' is an EFM. These
mathematical considerations constitute the starting point to understand
the approach described below to include additional constraints.

2.3 Including additional constraints

We now introduce an additional constraint to Equations (1)—(3). In ana-
logy to (3), Equation (6) represents a generic linear constraint, where
dTe [RR and ee [R are known parameters.

dT‘vze (6)

To illustrate the effect of Equation (6), Figure 2A and B represent the
feasible region deﬁned by (1H3) and by (1H3) and (6), respectively.
With the addition of Equation (6), novel extreme points may arise, rep-
resented in Figure 2B by white crosses. The null space of matrix S,- for
these extreme points has more than one df and, consequently, they are not
EFMs. In particular, extreme points found in both feasible spaces in
Figure 2 are precisely the solutions of interest, represented with a white
dot. The mathematical properties of extreme points are considered next.

Similarly to Equation (5), we introduce SH as the matrix grouping S
with bT and dT, as illustrated by Equation (7):

S
bT
5** = dT (7)

We now analyze the number of df of the matrices S**, S* and S so as
to discuss when an extreme point from the feasible region deﬁned by
Equations (1)—(3) and (6) is an EFM. As shown in the Supplementary
Material, a solution 1' is an EFM if its corresponding matrix S,- has one df.
While this was always achieved for the extreme points in the feasible
region deﬁned by Equations (1)—(3), two possible scenarios arise when
Equation (6) is included, as seen in Table 1.

Two considerations should be kept in mind. First, assuming that the
solution 1' is an extreme point of the feasible region deﬁned by Equations
(1)—(3) and (6), then S,** has zero df. Second, if the solution 1' satisﬁes
Equations (1H3) and (6) and is an EFM, then it will correspond to an
extreme point in the system of Equations (1)—(3). Consequently, S,* has
also zero df.

Overall, we aim to calculate extreme points shared by the feasible
regions (1)—(3) and (1)43) and (6). To guarantee that the obtained solu-
tion is an EFM, S? and 51* must have zero df. In other words, removing
dT from Sf*does not affect the number of df. This occurs if dT can be
written as a linear combination of the rows of  This is precisely the key
point in our approach so as to guarantee that the obtained solution,
which simultaneously satisﬁes (3) and (6), is certainly an EFM and, there-
fore, fulﬁlls NDC. Note that the linear combination should be achieved
by combining rows in S“, not in S*. This is not trivial because the set of
columns forming the target EFM is not known beforehand. To overcome
this, we introduce here a MILP which will allow us to directly calculate an
EFM fulﬁlling at the same time (1)—(3) and (6).

2.4 Mixed Integer Linear Programming framework

We introduce the W matrix that contains the transposed rows deﬁned in
Equations (1H3), as observed in Equation (8). Note that S T refers to the
transpose of the original stoichiometric matrix S. The dimensions of W
are R>(C + 1) and, therefore, we have a row for each reaction denoted
as W,.

W: [STb] (8)

We need to write d vector in Equation (6) as a linear combination of
columns in W. The introduction of non-negative slack variables, a, and 8,
(r = 1, . . . ,R), is required to allow a reaction to be neglected when impos-
ing the linear combination, as it only applies to reactions activated in the
ﬁnal solution. This is shown in Equation (9). Note here that the vector
x 6 [RC + 1 stores the coefficients of the linear combination.

W,‘x=d,+8,—8,,r=1,...,R (9)

We now introduce the binary variable Zr, being 2,21 if vr>0 and
2,20 if v,=0. This is achieved with Equation (10). Note that M is a
sufﬁciently big scalar.

vrzzr, M>Z,Zv,,r=1,...,R (10)

In addition, Equation (11) allows us to impose that if Zr: 1 then
6,: 8,: 0, namely, when reaction r is active, it is forcing its correspond-
ing row in W to take part in the linear combination. This is imposed by
the following equation:

M(1-Zr)28,+8nr=1,---,R (11)

If a feasible solution is found in the set of constraints (1)—(3), (6),
(9)411), we can be sure that there is, at least, one EFM satisfying
Equations (3) and (6). The opposite also applies, namely, if the set of
constraints (1)—(3), (6), (9H11) is infeasible; then no EFM can satisfy
Equations (3) and (6).

Finally, minimizing the number of active reactions, we guarantee that
the solution is an EFM:

As done in previous works (de Figueiredo et al., 2009; Rezola et al.,
2013), we can include constraints for enumerating a given number of
EFMs. We introduce here Z’,‘ as the value of the 2, variable in the k-th
solution. With Equation (13), we prevent previously calculated solutions
from appearing again.

Note here that this methodology, comprising Equations (1H3), (6),
(9)—(13), can be naturally extended to include additional constraints. Let
us assume that, in analogy to Equation (6), J additional constraints must
be satisﬁed, as observed in equation (14). Note that d/ and e], j: 1, . . . ,J,
are input information.

(dj)T>v 3 ej,j =1,...,J (14)

To guarantee that each all can be written as a linear combination of the
rows of S and b, Equations (9) and (11) are redefined as follows:

W.>xf=d{+aJ,'—y,'.j=1.....J.r=1.....R (15)
J . .
M(1—z.)=ZaJ.—a.r=1.....R (16)
j:l

As a result, for each new linear constraint j, we add up (C + I) +2>R
new (continuous) variables to the model (xi, 5/ and 8/), as well as R add-
itional constraints. Because equation (15) does not involve any binary
variable, including additional constraints does not dramatically increase
the required computational time, as shown in the Section 3.

2.5 Illustrative example

The methodology presented above is now illustrated by means of a toy
example. In particular, this example is based on the metabolic network in
Figure 3A, which comprises one metabolite and four reactions. Let us
consider two different questions: (i) ﬁnding an EFM activating reactions
1 and 3 and (ii) calculating an EFM with reactions 1 and 2.

In the ﬁrst question, we impose v1 7e 0 and v3: 0, leading to
a] = y] = a3 = y3 = 0. Therefore, based on the system of equations in
Figure 3B, x1 = —1 and x2: 1. In addition, the mass-balance constraint
is satisﬁed by activating only v1 and v3, and, therefore, we can ensure that
v1 and v3 can operate together in an EFM. Finally, as we minimize the
number of active reactions, we have v1 2 v3: 1.

Regarding the second question, after activating v1 and v2 and imposing
a] = y] = 82 = y2 = 0, the system of equations in Figure 3C leads to x1 = 1
and x2 = —1. However, the mass-balance is not achieved activating v1 and
v2. In particular, we need to consume the produced molecules of A by v1
and V2. Note that v3 and v4 can perform this task and, therefore, we have
the following cases:

(1) v37é0: the activation of v1, v2 and v3 and the subsequent inactiva-
tion of 8121/1282: y2=a3=y3=0 leads to an incompatible
system of equations in Figure 3C. Thus, this case does not fulﬁll
the imposed systems of equations.

(2) v4 7e 0. As in the previous case, with the activation of v1, v2 and v4
and the subsequent inactivation of a] = y] = 82 = y2 = a4 = y4 = 0,
the arising system of equations (Fig. 3C) is not consistent.

(3) v3 7e 0 and v4 7e 0: As in the previous cases, the system of equations
becomes infeasible.

Overall, there is no ﬂux conﬁguration satisfying Equations (1H3) and
(6), as well as Equation (9). Therefore, no EFM can simultaneously ac-
tivate v1 and V2. This second scenario constitutes one of the extreme
points represented with the white crosses in Figure 2B.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Validation

In this section, an empirical validation of the methodology pro-
posed above is conducted. With this analysis, we aim to show
that our approach correctly decides whether there is an EFM
activating two particular reactions and enumerates all their
underlying solutions. To that end, we need to use a network
where all the EFMs can be determined.

For that, let us ﬁrst consider the metabolic network presented
by Schuster et a]. (2000), which merges the glycolysis, pentose
phosphate pathway and part of the gluconeogenesis. This net-
work involves seven EFMs. Several approaches can be applied to
enumerate this set of EFMs (de Figueiredo et al., 2009; Kaleta
et al., 2009; Terzer and Stelling, 2008; Von Kamp and Schuster,
2006). Using the approach described above, for each pair of
reaction involved in at least one EFM, we successfully enumer-
ated all its underlying solutions. We extended this analysis for the
rest of the pairs of reactions, and, as expected, an infeasible
MILP was obtained.

Next, we studied the computational performance of our meth-
odology in the light of a more complex metabolic network. In
particular, we considered the metabolic network presented by
Rezola et a]. (2011), which was obtained after lumping all the
reactions involved in the 100 shortest Generating Flux Modes
producing lysine in the GSMN reconstruction of Escherichia coli
presented by Feist et al.(2007). Overall, this metabolic network
comprises 99 metabolites and 195 reactions, after splitting revers-
ible reactions into two irreversible steps. We computed the full
set of EFMs with efmtool (Terzer and Stelling, 2008), obtaining
354 225 solutions. For convenience, we deﬁne here a feasible pair
as a couple of reactions being simultaneously activated in, at
least, one of these EFMs. Similarly, an infeasible pair of reac-
tions is deﬁned as a subset of two reactions that do not appear
together in any EFM. The validation here is divided in two parts
with the objective of conﬁrming that (i) a feasible pair leads to
a feasible MILP and (ii) an infeasible pair always produces an
infeasible MILP. Therefore, here we are not concerned with find-
ing an EFM, but proving whether an MILP is feasible. Finding a
feasible solution is sufﬁcient to guarantee that at least one EFM
exists involving a pair of reactions and, therefore, the objective
function is not needed.

Efﬁcient algorithms solving MILPs can be found in the lit-
erature. However, the computation time required to obtain a

solution could be high. The causes that increase the computation
time are not always tied to the complexity of the problem. In
particular, trivial effects, such as the order of the constraints, as
well as the selected solver, may severely affect the computation
time. Aiming at minimizing these trivial effects, we detail in the
Supplementary Material an alternative formulation. It should be
highlighted here that in essence both formulations represent the
same problem. A priori, we cannot conclude which formulation
is more efﬁcient for a particular pair of reactions. Therefore, we
solved both problems and selected the one involving the min-
imum computation time.

We successfully found a solution for each feasible pair.
Figure 4 shows the computation time histogram corresponding
to 99% (21 142) of the feasible pairs, while discarding 1% (214)
of them, which represent strong outliers that distort the figure. In
particular, out of 21 356 feasible pairs, only 20 of them required
>100 s, with the longest computational time being equal to 1400
s. The median and the mean values are equal to 0.2 and 0.96 s,
respectively. Note from Figure 4 that 5.34 s are sufﬁcient for
capturing 99% of the feasible pairs.

To emphasize the progress brought by our approach, we
explored the model presented by de Figueiredo et a]. (2009)
when additional constraints are directly included. For that, as
this model does not prevent non-elementary solutions (those rep-
resented with a cross in Fig. 2B) from appearing, we calculated
the number of them required to obtain an EFM per each feasible
pair. In particular, we enumerated an average of 1197 solutions
before obtaining an EFM, which clearly highlights the necessity
of the methodology presented here.

We consider now the second part of this validation, namely,
whether infeasible pairs lead to infeasible MILPs. Finding
whether a given MILP is infeasible can be extremely hard. To
overcome this, we impose a time limit for the solving procedure.
In other words, if a particular MILP exceeds this time limit and
no solution has been found, we assume that it is infeasible. As
discussed above, 99% of the feasible pairs required <5.34 s to
validate their feasibility. Based on this, we imposed an upper
limit of 5.34s when solving each MILP corresponding to infeas-
ible pairs. After performing this analysis, we found two scen-
arios: (i) the MILP was identiﬁed as infeasible or (ii) the time
limit was reached. It is important to emphasize that no feasible
MILP can be obtained here. To reinforce this, we randomly

selected 10 infeasible pairs for which the time limit was reached
and repeated the analysis increasing the time limit to 21600s
(6 h). After performing this task, no feasible solution was
found, which supports here again the correct behavior of our
approach.

Finally, we validated the performance of our approach when
more than two constraints are imposed. For that, we generated
10000 random triplets of reactions and evaluated, in each case,
the solution obtained when the reactions in the triplet are forced
as active. On one hand, we checked that an elementary solution
was directly obtained for each feasible triplet. On the other hand,
we conﬁrmed that when no EFM exists involving a given triplet
of reactions, an infeasible model arises or no solution is found
before reaching the time limit, namely, 5.34 s. This also general-
izes our approach to consider multiple constraints.

3.2 Case study

The microbial-based biofuel production constitutes a relevant
topic in the field of bioengineering. In this light, the yeast
S.cerevisiae is one of the most widely used cell factories
(Caspeta and Nielsen, 2013). In addition, the metabolism of
this yeast has been extensively studied for years, and many
genome-scale metabolic reconstructions can be found in the lit-
erature (Forster et al., 2003; Heavner et al., 2012).

In particular, much effort is being put into optimizing the yield
of ethanol production. Improving this yield leads to a reduction
of the cost per unit of produced ethanol and an increase in the
economic efﬁciency of the process. In this section, we will calcu-
late EFMs with a 100% yield from glucose. Including this infor-
mation in the model can be easily achieved by means of the
following linear equation:

Veto/1 _ 3 ' Vglucose 2 0 

where vet”), represents the flux of the reaction producing ethanol
and vglumw the activity of the reaction consuming glucose. The
coefﬁcient of 3 multiplying vglume imposes that the proportion of
consumed glucose and produced ethanol is that corresponding to
a yield of 100%.

In addition, because solutions deactivating both vet”), and
vglume lack from interest, we impose a lower bound for the glu-
cose consumption, as shown below:

Vglucose 2 1 

Note here that Equations (17) and (18) can be included in the
model by substituting Equations (3) and (6). Therefore, we will
obtain EFMs activating both vet”), and vglume and guaranteeing
the minimum yield imposed by Equation (17). In addition to
glucose, we also simulated a free supply of glycine, which has a
positive effect in the ethanol concentration (Thomas et al., 1994).
Therefore, we may obtain EFMs consuming both glucose and
glycine, leading to a yield above the imposed in (17).

We based our analysis on the recently published genome-scale
reconstruction Yeast 5 (Heavner et al., 2012). Aiming at reducing
the computation time, the solving procedure was slightly mod-
iﬁed. In particular, the MILP solver provides the first feasible
integer solution (FFI) obtained. We guarantee that within the
reactions active in FFI at least one EFM fulﬁlling the imposed
conditions is involved. Efﬁcient algebraic techniques (Terzer and

Stelling, 2008) can be applied to calculate such EFM from the
FFI. This procedure reduces the computation time from few
minutes to seconds.

Overall, we calculated 100 EFMs in an average time of 60 s per
solution. Next, we validate that the obtained solutions are,
indeed, EFMs satisfying (17%(18). We present in Figure 5, one
of these solutions where all the carbons of the glucose are di-
verted to ethanol production. The list of calculated EFMs can be
found in the Supplementary Material.

For completeness, we evaluated our approach when more
than two additional constraints are imposed. In particular, we
calculated 100 EFMs activating a given random set of five

reactions: (i) 6—phosph0gluconolactonase, (ii) nucleoside tripho—
sphatase, (iii) transketolase 1, (iv) glyoxylate transport and (v)
malate dehydrogenase. We were able to enumerate 100 EFMs
using a regular desktop computer in an average time of 20 min-
per EFM. Despite the expected time increment, this analysis re-
ﬂects the capability of our approach to deal with multiple
reactions.

4 CONCLUSIONS

EFMs constitute a well-established approach developed in the
past 20 years. The EFM approach has been applied to different
questions in systems biology. However, its application to
GSMNs is restricted because of the combinatorial explosion in
the number of solutions. In the past years, approaches to calcu-
lating a subset of EFMs in GSMNs have been developed.
However, because the number of EFMs emerging from large
metabolic networks goes beyond the scope of any approach, al-
ternative strategies are required.

In this article, instead of calculating a large number of EFMs
so as to properly represent any metabolic phenotype, we define a
novel framework providing those EFMs of interest. This ques-
tion is not straightforward and requires additional mathematical
developments, as presented here. Based on them, we deﬁne a
MILP that enumerates EFMs fulﬁlling several biological con-
straints. Although efﬁcient algorithms and methods exist to
solve MILPs, they may take an unacceptable amount of time.
Aiming at reducing the computation time, redefining the formu-
lation preventing the use of integer variables constitutes a future
line of research. For situations with several biological con-
straints, this is particularly relevant, as the number of variables
and constraints further increases and, therefore, the arising
MILP will be even more difﬁcult to solve.

The methodology was validated in two metabolic networks for
which the full set of EFMs can be calculated. Its application to
GSMNs was also conﬁrmed studying the ethanol production by
the yeast S .cerevisiae. In this case study, we also showed different
types of constraints that can be included in our model, e.g.
activation of a set of reactions, imposing a minimum yield etc.
We emphasize here that, based on the metabolic reconstruction
under consideration, different EFMs with a carbon yield of
100% were obtained. The thermodynamic feasibility of these
solutions requires further consideration. Nevertheless, these
EFMs may provide researchers with novel efﬁcient mechanisms
to produce ethanol more efﬁciently.

Our approach allows us to more effectively compute a selective
subset of EFMs and, therefore, it opens new possibilities to
explore metabolic pathways without computing the complete
set of EFMs. The value of computing a subset of EFMs has
been previously shown in different works: analyzing omics data
(Rezola et al., 2013), elucidating novel metabolic pathways in
human metabolism (Kaleta et al., 2011), revealing potential stra-
tegies for metabolic engineering (Ip et al., 2011) or understanding
the role of different carbon sources in the growth of E.coli (Chan
and Ji, 2011). Our approach can certainly complement and
extend these previous analyses.

In particular, the inherent potential of this approach can be
strengthened with the integration of omics data. For instance, if
we observe that a given set of enzymes are coexpressed in a

particular scenario, applying the methodology presented here
will provide us the metabolic mechanisms connecting them.
Analogously, this can be extended to integrate data from meta-
bolomic experiments.

Overall, the contribution presented here will undoubtedly
facilitate the application of EFMs in GSMNs and overcome
the manifold biological questions that were unreachable before.

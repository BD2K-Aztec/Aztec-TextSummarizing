Abstract

Summary: VarSim is a framework for assessing alignment and variant calling accuracy in high—
throughput genome sequencing through simulation or real data. In contrast to simulating a ran—
dom mutation spectrum, it synthesizes diploid genomes with germline and somatic mutations
based on a realistic model. This model leverages information such as previously reported muta—
tions to make the synthetic genomes biologically relevant. VarSim simulates and validates a wide
range of variants, including single nucleotide variants, small indels and large structural variants. It
is an automated, comprehensive compute framework supporting parallel computation and mul—
tiple read simulators. Furthermore, we developed a novel map data structure to validate read
alignments, a strategy to compare variants binned in size ranges and a lightweight, interactive,
graphical report to visualize validation results with detailed statistics. Thus far, it is the most
comprehensive validation tool for secondary analysis in next generation sequencing.

Availability and implementation: Code in Java and Python along with instructions to download the
reads and variants is at http://bioinform.github.i0/varsim.

Due to the lack of ground truth for real data, simulation is a com-
mon approach for the evaluation of high-throughput sequencing’s
secondary analysis, ranging from alignment to variant calling. An
early attempt to perform validation without simulation is given in
Zook et al. (2014). However, their attempt involved extensive hiolo-
gical experiments and does not cover the full spectrum of variants.

Most tools simulate variants, but no single tool simulates the full
spectrum of variants from small variants to all types of structural vari-
ations (SVs). RSVSim (Bartenhagen and Dugas, 2013) simulates SVs,
but does not simulate SNVs and small indels. It also does not generate

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The major function of signal transduction pathways
in cells is to sense signals from the environment and process
the information through signaling molecules in order to regulate
the activity of transcription factors. On the molecular level, the
information transmitted by a small number of signal molecules
is amplified in the internal signaling pathway through enzyme
catalysis, molecular modification and via the activation or inhibition
of interactions. However, the dynamic system behavior of a signaling
pathway can be complex and, despite knowledge of the pathway
components and interactions, it is still a challenge to interpret the
pathways behavior. Therefore, a systematic method is proposed in
this study to quantify the signal transduction ability.

Results: Based on the non-linear signal transduction system, signal
transduction ability can be investigated by solving a Hamilton—
Jacobi inequality (HJl)-constrained optimization problem. To avoid
difficulties associated with solving a complex HJl-constrained
optimization problem for signal transduction ability, the Takagi—
Sugeno fuzzy model is introduced to approximate the non-linear
signal transduction system by interpolating several local linear
systems so that the HJl-constrained optimization problem can be
replaced by a linear matrix inequality (LMl)-constrained optimization
problem. The LMI problem can then be efficiently solved for
measuring signal transduction ability. Finally, the signal transduction
ability of two important signal transduction pathways was measured
by the proposed method and confirmed using experimental data,
which is useful for biotechnological and therapeutic application and
drug design.

1 INTRODUCTION

Signal transduction pathways are one of the fastest information
processing networks. They enable cells to sense and trans-
duce extracellular signals through inter- and intra-cellular
communication. Signal transduction pathways consist of inter-
actions between signaling proteins, where different external changes

or events stimulate speciﬁc signaling pathways. Typical external
signal stimuli are hormones, pheromones, heat, cold, light, osmotic
pressure and concentration change of substances such as, KT, Ca2+
or cAMP (Hohmann, 2002; Teraoka et (11., 2001; Xie and Askari,
2002). Metabolic processes, such as homeostasis (Hohmann, 2002),
the growth (Aplin and Juliano, 1999) and differentiation of tissues
through endocrine signaling (Herrington and Carter-Su, 2001),
the synthesis and secretion of proteins, such as in blood clotting
and immune-responses and the composition of intracellular and
extracellular ﬂuids, such as in the processes of photoreception and
olfaction, are all closely regulated by speciﬁc signaling pathways
(Koshland et (11., 1982). Hence the proper function of cellular
signaling pathways is essential for life.

On the molecular level, signal transduction involves the
production or degradation of substances, molecular modiﬁcation
and the activation or inhibition of chemical reactions. Many
previous studies have focused on signaling molecules, cell-surface
receptors and the second messengers of the signaling pathway.
Aside from molecular transfer, signaling pathways can also be
viewed as the information processing and transferring systems of
cells (Klipp, 2005). Many studies have investigated the properties
of signaling pathways, such as ampliﬁcation (Hohmann, 2002),
speciﬁcity (Fan et (11., 2008), adaption, ultrasensitivity (Huang and
Ferrell, 1996; Kholodenko, 2000), oscillation (Kholodenko, 2000)
and synchronization. However, due to the complex behavior of
signaling pathways, knowledge of the components of a pathway
and their interactions is often not enough to interpret the dynamic
system behavior of the pathway. To the best of our knowledge, the
intension to express the signal transduction ability into mathematical
formula appeared in 1982 (Koshland et (11., 1982). It focused on the
sensitivity ampliﬁcation, which is deﬁned as the ratio of the percent
change in the output response to the percent change in the input
stimulus, i.e. the relative change of the system output respect to a
speciﬁc input. Then the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
signaling pathway in linear form is studied and signal amplitude
is deﬁned as the ratio of the total response to the signal duration,
which depends on the input (Heinrich et (11., 2002). Next, a stochastic
differential model of MAPK signaling pathway is considered and the
signal ampliﬁcation is deﬁned as signal gain, which exists at least
one maximum with respect to the ratio of inputs to outputs (Samoilov
et (11., 2005). Recently, Marhl et (11. compared the signaling pathways
in biological systems with the cascade mechanisms in electrical
engineering systems and then also deﬁned the maximal ampliﬁcation

as the ratio of the maximum of output to the maximum of input,
i.e. outputmax/inputmax (Marhl et (11., 2009). Obviously, these
mentioned techniques deﬁned the signal transduction ability on case-
by-case basis, that is, the results are affected not only by the structure
of the system but also the input to the system. This article speciﬁcally
investigates signal transduction ability, a dynamic system behavior
of signaling pathways.

As a system for processing and transferring information, signaling
pathways require an ampliﬁcation mechanism to reduce the expense
associated with the production of signaling molecules and to ensure
rapid responses. From the viewpoint of energy expenditure, signal
ampliﬁcation can effectively reduce the quantity of initial key
substances necessary to ensure upstream sensing as well as having
signiﬁcant effects on downstream signal transduction. Also, if a
deleterious stress impacts a cell, the cell is required to ensure a
response is induced as soon as possible through signaling pathways.
Accordingly, there are numerous studies indicating the importance
and the ﬁinctional role of signal ampliﬁcation. An example is the
osmoadaptation of yeast under osmotic stress, where an integrated
mathematical model is provided for the signaling pathway to
demonstrate the relationship between the rate constants of kinases
and phosphatases and signal ampliﬁcation (Klipp et (11., 2005). For
liver glycogenolysis and the release of glucose, a level of 10—10 M
of epinephrine in blood can generate intracellular concentrations of
10—6 M cAMP with a signal ampliﬁcation of 104 (Harvey et (11.,
2000).

In the ﬁeld of electrical engineering, there are several
electrical components, such as transistors, which possess the signal
ampliﬁcation property. The analysis of the ampliﬁcation properties
of these gadgets has been undertaken (Marhl et (11., 2009) and the
same analysis may also be performed on the ampliﬁcation properties
of a cellular signaling pathway (Detwiler et (11., 2000). However,
because of the non-linearity of signaling pathways, knowledge
about the systematic properties of the pathways remains limited
and incomplete. In this study, signaling pathways are investigated
from the dynamic system perspective for which a signal transduction
ability measurement is proposed based on signals and systems theory
from the systematic viewpoint. In accordance with the system gain
viewpoint, the ratio of output to input signal energy of the studied
signaling pathway is conducted for all possible input signals. This
measurement of signal transduction ability is more dependent on
the system characteristics of the studied signaling pathway rather
than the input signals. Similar to an ampliﬁer, the measure is more
dependent on the systematic characteristics of the ampliﬁer itself
compared with the input signals.

The proposed signal transduction measurement scheme for non-
linear signaling pathways needs to solve the corresponding non-
linear Hamilton—Jacobi inequalities (HJIs). At present, except for
some simple cases, there is no analytic or numerical solution
for HJIs. Takagi—Sugeno (T—S) ﬁizzy systems have efﬁciently
interpolated several local linear systems via a set of ﬁizzy bases
to approximate a non-linear system, enabling the HHS in a non-
linear signal processing problem to be replaced by a set of
linear matrix inequalities (LMIs; Chen et (11., 1999; Chen et (11.,
2000; Takagi and Sugeno, 1985). This then allows the non-linear
signal transduction ability measurement problem to be transformed
into an equivalent LMIs-constrained optimization problem, which
is more easily to solve. Because the measurement method is
based on ﬁizzy system theory for signal transmission systems,

the transduction ability of non-linear signal transduction pathways
is able to be investigated from these ﬁizzy-interpolated local
linear signal transduction pathways. Using this method, increasing
biological transduction insights can be obtained from the linear
system viewpoint. In the future, signal transduction systems may
be characterized according to the proposed measurement, which
is useful for biotechnological and therapeutic applications, and for
the development of drug design. Synthetic biology is increasingly
focusing on the rational construction of biological systems based on
engineering principles in order to achieve some systematic design
speciﬁcations. The proposed method described herein may hold
potential for the analysis and design of synthetic gene networks or
pathways for next-generation synthetic gene networks (Hasty et (11.,
2002; Kaem et (11., 2003; Murphy et (11., 2007).

2 METHODS

2.1 Dynamic model of signaling pathways

Mathematical modeling of metabolic networks has been studied extensively
and is useful for describing experimental data. deducing regulatory principles
and understanding more complex dynamic phenomena. such as oscillation
(Hasty et (11.. 2002; Kholodenko 2000; Lin et (11.. 2009). However. in
modeling signaling pathways. few examples have been studied due to
the unavailability of experimental data. As the structure of signaling
pathways consists of consecutive activations and deactivations of proteins.
the signaling pathways can be modeled as a series of chemical reactions.
expressed as a system of rate aligns. The appropriate choice of rate
expressions is a matter of a prior knowledge of the whole system
and modeling intuition. For instance. linear and bilinear expressions or
MichaelisiMenten kinetics have previously been used to model signaling
pathways (Klipp. 2005; Lin et (11.. 2009).

Independent or coupled kinase cascades participate in a variety of
different intracellular signaling pathways that cover the spectrum of cellular
processes. including intracellular cell growth. differentiation. transformation
and apoptosis. For example. MAPK cascades transduce signals from the cell
membrane to the nucleus in response to a wide range of stimuli (Fig. 1;
Harvey et (11.. 2000). The pathway consists of several levels. where the
activated kinase at each level phosphorylates the kinase at the next level
in the cascade (Fig. 1). The dynamic modeling of a MAPK cascade may be
represented by the system in (1) with MichaelisiMenten kinetics formulation
(Kholodenko. 2000).

C: [O  O 1]. i.e. C is the row vector of n elements with 0 expressed at all

System knowledge resides in models and data. A model is a construction.
usually validated by data. Data validate models. and models give system
meaning of data. They are opposite of the same coin. Actually. in this study.
we assume the system models of signaling pathways have been identiﬁed by
experimental data. Then. we use the system models of signaling pathways to
investigate their signal transduction abilities. Since the signal transduction
ability is a system property. it is not easy to investigate from input/output data
directly. Further. from the signal transduction ability. we could get insight
into the system meaning of signaling pathways. In this study. we assume the
system dynamic model of signaling pathways in (3) has been well identiﬁed
by rich input/output signals.

2.2 Signal transduction ability measurement

Many properties of signaling pathways are investigated. including signaling
time. signal duration or signal amplitude (Heinrich 21 111.. 2002). The focus
of this study is on the signal transduction ability of signaling pathways. The
transduction ability is deﬁned from the system gain Viewpoint as follows
(Boyd. 1994):

1/2
(11? yT<z>y<z>dz / If) IIY(I)||2 (4)
pa = sup — = Sup
Memo“  uT(t)u(t)dt/tf)1/2 u(t)eL2[0.tfl ||u(t)||2

where 11(1) and y(1) are the input and output signals of the signaling pathway.
respectively. The physical meaning of transduction ability is the maximum
ratio of the output signal to the input signal from the root mean square
sense for all of the possible bounded input signals within the time interval
[0.1f]. where L2[O.1f] denotes the set of all possible bounded signals in
[0.1f]. The reason for employing the maximum root mean square ratio of the
output signal to all possible input signals is that input signals may change
under different conditions. causing the signal energy ratio to vary. However.
transduction ability should be based on the maximum effect of all the possible
input signals on the output signals and exhibit greater dependency on the
characteristics of the dynamic system. in accordance with the system gain
Viewpoint. Theoretically. the transduction ability can be measured directly
by testing all possible bounded input signals to get the maximum root mean
square ratio. In general. the maximization problem described in (4) for
measuring the signal transduction ability of a signaling pathway cannot be
solved directly. It can only be solved indirectly by applying a systematic
analysis method on the signal transduction dynamic in (3). as described in
the following expressions.
Let us denote an upper bound of transduction ability as follows:

lly(t)II%/llu(t)ll§ <p2,V11(1)eL2 [0,1] (5)

 

or

||y(l)||%<pzllu(l)||%1V“(I)EL2[0~V] (6)
In (5) or (6). if p2 is the upper bound of ||y(1)||%/||11(1)||% for every 11(1) EL2[0.
1f]. then p2 is also the upper bound ofpg in (4). as every 11(1) 6 L2[0. 1f] should
include the input signal which leads to the maximum mean square ratio pa
in (4). Therefore. we can ﬁnd an upper bound p for the signal transduction
ability pa and then minimize the upper bound to approach the transduction
ability. i.e. the signal transduction ability pa is estimated by minimizing the
upper bound p.

PROPOSITION 1. If a positive function V(x) with V(O)=O is able to satisfy
the following HJI:

3V x T 1 3V x T 3V x
( ) f(x>+xTCTCx+ —, ( ) g(x>gT(x># <0 (7)
3x 4p 3x 3x
then the signal transduction ability of the signal pathway is <1).

Signaling transduction pathways in intracellular communication

 

Since p is the upper bound of transduction ability pa. the transduction
ability can be obtained by solving the following constrained optimization
problem:

pa = minp (8)
subject to HJI in (7) and V(x)> 0

It means to make p as small as possible without violating H] I constraint in (7).
After solving the transduction ability pa from the H] I constraint optimization
expression (8) and substituting pa for p in (7). we ﬁnd:

T T
(32(8) f(x>+xTCTCx+i2 (Wm) gamut—3V”) <0 (9)
x 4p” 3x 3x

 

 

If the transduction ability pa is small. the last term in (9) is positively large. In
this situation. the ﬁrst term (3 V(x)/3x)Tf(x) should be more negative (more
stable) so that the H] I in (9) still holds. On the other hand. if (3V(x)/3x)Tf(x)
is less negative (less stable). then the transduction ability pa should be large
enough to satisfy the HJI in (9). From the HJI in (9). it can be seen that the
signal transduction ability is more closely related to the system characteristics
f(x). g(x) and C of signaling pathway than to the external stimuli. This is
a similar case to a low-pass ﬁlter having greater dependence on the system
characteristic of the ﬁlter than the incoming noise.

In general. it is still very difﬁcult to solve the non-linear HJI-constrained
optimization problem for the measurement of signal transduction ability
described in (8). Thus. a fuzzy interpolation method is employed to overcome
the non-linear difﬁculties associated with solving the H] I problem in (7) and
to simplify the constrained optimization procedures required to solve the
transduction ability measurement problem in (8).

2.3 Signal transduction measurement via fuzzy method

Fuzzy dynamic modeling has been widely employed to approximate non-
linear dynamic systems and to simplify non-linear control problems by
interpolating several local linear dynamic systems (Chen 21 111.. 1999; Chen
21 111.. 2000). The T7S fuzzy dynamic model (Takagi and Sugeno. 1985)
is described by fuzzy ‘IfiThen’ rules and employed here to solve the
transduction ability measurement problem for the signaling pathway. The
i-th rule of the fuzzy model for the non-linear signal transduction pathway
in (3) is proposed as follows (Chen 21 111.. 1999; Chen 21 111.. 2000; Tseng
and Chen 2001; Tseng 21 111.. 2001):

Rule 1':Ifx1(1) is F,1.x2(1) is F,2.  x,(1) is F,,,

Then X=A1X(l)+Biu(l) (10)
y = me
where 1': 1.2.  L. x,(1) is the premise variable. F,]- is the fuzzy set. A,

and B, are the local system matrices. L is the number of fuzzy rules and l
is the number of premise variables. If all state variables are used as premise
variables then 1:11. The physical meaning of fuzzy rule 1' in (10) is that if
the state variables x1(1). x2(1).  x,(1) are with the local fuzzy sets F,1. F,2.
 F ,1. then the non-linear signaling pathway in (3) could be represented by
the linear system in the ‘Then’ part of (10). The fuzzy inference system of
(10) can then be described as follows (Chen 21 111.. 1999; Chen 21 111.. 2000;
Takagi and Sugeno. 1985):

- 21:1 Mi (16(1)) [A,x(1) +3114,” L
x: — = » mi 16(1) [A,x(1)+B,u(,)]
214211141040) z21:1 ( )

y=CX(t) (11)

where mica» = 111M012; mom» and mm» = Milo-(1:11)). with
F ,j(x,(1)) describing the grade of membership of x,(1) in F ,1- and m,(x(1)).
1': 1. 2.  L describing the fuzzy bases. The denominator lt1,()r(1))
is applied to enable normalization so that the total sum of the fuzzy bases
214:1m,(x(1))=1. The physical meaning of the fuzzy inference system in (11)
is that L local linear signaling pathways are interpolated through non-linear
fuzzy bases m,(x(1)) to approximate the non-linear signaling pathway in (3).

Aside from the fuzzy bases. other interpolation bases could also be employed
to interpolate several linear signaling pathways to approximate a non-linear
signaling pathway.

By fuzzy approximation. the non-linear signaling pathway can be
represented by the following fuzzy interpolated signaling pathway:

5: =f(x) +g(x>u = 2; m,» (xm) [Am +3140] (12)

There are many system identiﬁcation methods available to determine the
local system matrixes A, and B, for the fuzzy model (Takagi and Sugeno.
1985). such as the fuzzy toolbox in MATLAB.

PROPOSITION 2. For the non-linear signaling pathway in (12). if a positive
deﬁnite symmetric matrix P exists. satisfying the following Riccati-like
inequalities:

1
PA,+A',»FP+CTC+FPB,B;FP<OJ=1,2,---,L (13)
then the signal transduction ability is bounded by p.
PROOF. see Appendix B in Supplementary Materials. I

The inequality in (13) can be considered as the local linearization of HJI
in (7). In order to solve the above Riccati-like inequalities by the conventional
LMI method. the positive deﬁnite symmetric matrix Q=PTl is multiplied
at both sides of (13). The Riccati-like inequalities in (13) can be described
as:

1
A,Q+QA;F+FB,B;F+QCTCQ<O,1‘=1,2,...,L (14)

By the Schur complement method (Boyd. 1994). the Riccati-like inequalities
in (14) are then equivalent to the following LMIs:

AiQ+QA,T + #113? QCT
CQ —1

If the LMIs in (15) hold for Q > 0. the signal transduction ability of non-linear
signaling pathway is < p and p is the upper bound of the signal transduction
ability.

Using the fuzzy approximation method. the H] I in (7) is interpolated by a
set of Riccati-like algebraic inequalities in (13) or (14). Therefore. the signal
transduction ability of the non-linear signaling pathway could be obtained
by solving the following LMIs-constrained optimization problem:

:|<O,i=1,2,...,L (15)

pa =minp

subject to LMIs in (15) and Q > O (16)

which can then be solved by decreasing p until no positive deﬁnite symmetric
matrix Q is able to satisfy the inequalities in (13) or (14).

REMARK 1. The Riccati-like inequalities in (13) or (14) are an approximation
of HJI with L local linear systems. Similarly. the LMIs-constrained
optimization problem in (16). describing the signal transduction ability
measurement of a non-linear signaling pathway. is also an efﬁcient approach
based on a fuzzy interpolation method to replace the very difﬁcult HJI-
constrained optimization problem in (8). The LMIs-constrained optimization
problem for the signal transduction ability measurement is known as an
“genvalue problem”. which can be efﬁciently solved by the LMI toolbox in
MATLAB.

REMARK 2. After substituting pa for p in (13). we get

PA,+A;FP+CTC+§PB,B;FP<OJ=1,2,---,L (17)
(I

If pa is smaller. the last term will be larger so that the eigenvalues of A,
would be in the far left-hand complex plane (i.e. with more negative real
part or more stable) and (17) would hold. If pa is larger. the last term in (17)
will be smaller. meaning that the eigenvalues of A, would be closer to the
imaginary axis (i.e. with smaller negative real part or less stable). In general.

the signaling pathways of the cell amplify the input signals (i.e. pa > 1).
In this situation. the eigenvalues of A, would approach the imaginary axis
(less stable) in order to amplify the extracellular signals so as to enable
the downstream activation of the corresponding genes within the cell. The
signal transduction ability of the signaling pathway is more dependent on
the system characteristics A,. B, and C than on the external signal 11(1). just
as a low-pass ﬁlter is more dependent on the low-pass characteristic (poles
and zeros) of the system than on the ﬁltered noise.

REMARK 3. In this study. we assume the system dynamic model of signaling
pathways in (3) has been well identiﬁed. However. there are some parameter
estimation errors due to the incorrect structure. stochastic noises (Chen
and Zhang. 2004; Zhang and Chen. 2006). infeasible parameter region and
solution method. The effect of these parameter estimation errors may lead
to an overestimate of signal transduction ability pa and is discussed in
Supplementary Materials.

3 RESULTS

To demonstrate the procedure of our proposed measurement of the
signal transduction ability, two signaling pathway examples are
described using the simulation method.

3.1 MAPK signal transduction pathway

The MAPK signal transduction pathway is one of the most well-
known and well-studied signaling pathways. The pathway is highly
conserved in eukaryotes, including humans, Drosophila and yeast.
A wide variety of membrane receptors, including RTK and cytokine
receptors, utilize the MAPK cascade to transfer external upstream
signals to the nucleus (Harvey 21 (11., 2000). As soon as MAPK is
activated by the signaling pathway, it is translocated into the nucleus,
promoting the transcription of hundreds of genes. Based on these
properties, the MAPK cascade was chosen as the ﬁrst simulation
example.

In mammalian cells, the MAPK cascade is operated in a sequential
fashion downstream from an activated Ras protein. Active Ras
binds to a Raf protein (MAPKKK), thereby activating it. The active
Raf phosphorylates and thereby activates MEK (MAPKK). Active
MEK then phosphorylates and activates MAP kinase. Finally MAP
kinase phosphorylates many different proteins, including nuclear
transcription factors that mediate cellular responses. In summary,
activation of Ras by RTK induces a kinase cascade that includes

  

Raf, MEK and MAPK (RTK —> Ras —> Raf —> MEK —> MAPK;
Harvey 21 (11., 2000).

The dynamics of a MAPK cascade can be represented by
the ODE system in (1). The input signal 11(1) is MAPKKKK
and the output signal y(1) is MAPK-pp. The values for the rate
constants, the Michaelis—Menten constants and enzyme rates are
adopted from (Kholodenko, 2000), which were obtained from
ﬁtting the experimental data (Supplementary Table S1). The
performance of the MAPK kinase cascade is measured in the
ability to transmit and amplify the signal and then to notably
enhance the concentration of double-phosphorylated MAPK which
is dependent on the dynamic system of the signaling pathway and
their constants. The simulation procedure was initiated by selecting
a fuzzy model to approximate the non-linear model. Selection of
the model required the approximation of the parameters of the
fuzzy model, A,- and B,- in (10) or (11), which can be found by
the least mean square parameter estimation algorithm based on a
system identiﬁcation method (Takagi and Sugeno, 1985). The LMIs
in (15) can then be solved via the LMI toolbox in MATLAB.
Finally, the signal transduction ability in (16) can be obtained by
decreasing ,0 until no positive deﬁnite symmetric matrix Q is able to
satisfy (15).

Using the least-squares parameter estimation method (Takagi and
Sugeno, 1985), the parameters A,- and B,- of the ﬁizzy model can be
identiﬁed to achieve the minimum square error (simulation results
were shown in Fig. 2). Since there are 8 state variables in the model,
and 2 ﬁizzy sets for each state variable, a total of 256 ﬁizzy rules
are applied to the ﬁizzy model. The fuzzy approximation error of
the MAPK signaling pathway in Figure 2 is ~10—10 with 256
fuzzy rules. Solving the optimization problem in (16), the signal
transduction ability of the fuzzy signaling pathway is measured as
pa =2.73 X 106 with the corresponding positive deﬁnite symmetric
matrix Q (shown in Supplementary Materials). This value implies
the best ability of the MAPK signaling pathway to transduce input
signals, that is, to amplify input signals. We have calculated ratio of
the output signal to the input signal from the root mean square sense
with a few kinds of input signals (shown in Supplementary Fig. S1).
From Equations (4)—(6), it is seen that pa is the least upper bound
of these ratios and could be conﬁrmed by the results in Figure S1.
However, it seems not an easy task to ﬁnd an adequate input signals
to achieve the transduction ability.

Signaling transduction pathways in intracellular communication

 

In this example, we focused on the sequential phosphorylation
of MAPKKK, MAPKK and MAPK to investigate the transduction
ability of on the MAPK signal transduction (Fig. 1). The whole
signaling pathway can be divided into three levels: (i) MAPKKK
—>MAPKKK-p, (ii) MAPKK—>MAPKK-pp and (iii) MAPK—>
MAPK-pp. According to our measurements, the signal transduction
ability of the entire signaling pathway is ~106, which closely
resembles the value source from the literature (Harvey 21 (11.,
2000). Moreover, the measurement of transduction abilities of the
above three stages by the proposed method were found to be ~80,
120 and 120, respectively. The results from measuring the MAPK
signaling pathway as a whole or as separate pathways are similar,
i.e. 106 ’=,80 X 120 X 120 through three separate sub-pathways. This
ﬁnding implies that the measurement for the signaling pathway can
be obtained as a whole or by measuring the separate pathways if the
size of signaling pathway is very large and the computation of signal
transduction ability in (16) becomes difﬁcult by a whole calculation
way (Zumsande and Gross, 2010).

3.2 NF-KB signal transduction pathway

According to research on the evolution of the NF-KB pathway, it has
existed for millions of years. The NF-KB pathway is referred to as
the master of transcription factors for immune-responses (Hoffmann
et (11., 2002). It is rapidly activated in mammalian immune-system
cells in response to infection, inﬂammation and a number of other
stressﬁil situations, such as ionizing radiation (Karin and Greten,
2005). In contrast to the previous MAPK pathway, which is a
reversible signaling pathway, the NF-KB is an irreversible pathway
where a component is proteolytically cleaved. The NF-KB pathway
in Figure 3 with dynamic model in (18) is investigated as the second
simulation example to demonstrate our proposed measurement
method.

dIKKKa(1)/d1 = k, X 11(1) >< (KN — IKKKa(1)) — k, X IKKKa(1)
dIKKn(1)/d1 = k4 >< (KNN — IKK" — IKKa — IKK,) — k1
>< IKKKZU) >< 1KK,,(1) (18)
dIKKa(1)/d1 = k1 >< IKKKZU) >< IKKn(1) — k3 >< IKKa(1)
dIKK,(1)/d1 = k3 >< IKKa(1) — k4 >< IKK,(1)

In resting cells, the dimeric transcription factor NF-KB, composed
of p50 and p65, is sequestered in the cytosol and bound to the
inhibitor I-KB (Hacker and Karin, 2006; Hoffmann and Baltimore,
2006). Stimulation by TNF-d or IL-1 induces activation of TAKl
kinase (IKKK), leading to activation of the trimeric I-KB kinase
(IKK). Ionizing radiation and other stresses are able to directly
activate I-KB. Following phosphorylation of I-KB by IKK and the
binding of ubiquitin ligase, the polyubiquitination of I-KB leads
to degradation by proteasomes. The removal of I-KB unmasks
the nuclear-localization signals in both subunits (p65 and p50) of
NF-KB, allowing their translocation into the nucleus.

Here NF-KB activates the transcription of numerous target genes,
including the gene encoding the alpha subunit of I-KB, which acts
to terminate signaling (Hayden and Ghosh, 2008). In this case, we
adopted the mathematical model in (18) (Hoffmann et (11., 2002),
and considered the IKKa as the output, which directly affects the
transcription factors (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table S2). Using
similar procedures employed in the previous example, we ﬁrst

constructed the ﬁizzy model and then solved the corresponding
LMIs (simulation results are shown in Fig. 4). We found the signal
transduction ability of the ﬁizzy signaling pathway to be pa: 6.48
X 105 with the corresponding positive deﬁnite symmetric matrix
shown in Supplementary Materials.

4 DISCUSSION

In order to measure the signal transduction ability in biological
experiments, it is necessary to test a multitude of input signals
and then compute the ratio of the output to the input signals. This
process requires numerous experiments and is not a realistic method
of obtaining data. Therefore, a method that is independent of the
measurement of output and input signals, which can be used to
quantify the signal transduction ability based on the system dynamic
model, is required. According to the concept of a system gain, we
proposed a new method to measure the signal transduction ability
of a signaling pathway, which is dependent only on the structure of
the signaling pathway and the kinetic parameters of the components
involved. Thus, the signal transduction ability can be viewed as
a quantity to characterize a signaling pathway. Considering the
important role of the MAPK and the NF-KB signaling pathways in
a cell, an immediate and strong enough response to environmental
changes or stresses is necessary. The simulation results describing a
large system gain in concentration are unsurprising.

Here, we extend the concept of signal amplitude to the non-linear
signaling pathway through a ﬁizzy modeling method, compared
with the linear case (Heinrich et (11., 2002). Moreover, the most of
previous studies considered the relationship between the output and
the inputs on case-by-case basis (Heinrich et (11., 2002; Koshland
e1 (11., 1982; Marhl et (11., 2009; Samoilov et (11., 2005). But from
the system point of view, the transduction ability is a systematic
characteristic of a signaling pathway, which should be invariant
unless the system has been changed. The value can be referred
to as the best ability of the signaling pathway to transduce input
signals, that is, to amplify input signals. However, the simulated
signal transduction ability might be not achieved easily without
testing all possible inputs for the least upper bound ratio pa in
(4) (see Supplementary Fig. S1). That is, inﬁnite L2-bounded input

signals are required to measure the transduction ability of a signaling
pathway, which could be an open question.

The simulation results also show that the proposed measurement
method can be applied in two different ways. A signaling pathway
can be viewed as a composition of several sub-signaling pathways.
The total signal transduction ability of a signaling pathway is
equal to the product of the signal transduction abilities of each
of the sub-signaling pathways. Each sub-signaling pathway can be
referred to as a basic element of the general signaling pathway.
Hence, if the signal transduction abilities of sub-signaling pathway
are known, we can design a signaling pathway with the desired
signal transduction ability. A similar concept is utilized in synthetic
biology (Hasty et (11., 2002; Kaern et (11., 2003; Murphy et (11.,
2007), which designate DNA sequences as the bricks to construct
an artiﬁcial ﬁinction in a cell. It is possible, through the analysis
of signal transduction ability, to analyze and calculate each sub-
signaling pathway so that a synthetic signal pathway can be
engineered with the desired signal transduction ability. In this
situation, greater biological transduction insights can be obtained
from the linear system viewpoint. In the future, characterization
of signal transduction systems by the proposed transduction ability
measurement may be useﬁil for biotechnological and therapeutic
applications as well as the development of drug design.

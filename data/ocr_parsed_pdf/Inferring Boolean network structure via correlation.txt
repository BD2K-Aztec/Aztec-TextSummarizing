ABSTRACT

Motivation: Accurate, context-specific regulation of gene
expression is essential for all organisms. Accordingly, it is very
important to understand the complex relations within cellular gene
regulatory networks. A tool to describe and analyze the behavior
of such networks are Boolean models. The reconstruction of a
Boolean network from biological data requires identification of
dependencies within the network. This task becomes increasingly
computationally demanding with large amounts of data created by
recent high-throughput technologies. Thus, we developed a method
that is especially suited for network structure reconstruction from
large-scale data. In our approach, we took advantage of the fact that
a specific transcription factor often will consistently either activate
or inhibit a specific target gene, and this kind of regulatory behavior
can be modeled using monotone functions.

Results: To detect regulatory dependencies in a network, we
examined how the expression of different genes correlates to
successive network states. For this purpose, we used Pearson
correlation as an elementary correlation measure. Given a Boolean
network containing only monotone Boolean functions, we prove that
the correlation of successive states can identify the dependencies
in the network. This method not only finds dependencies in
randomly created artificial networks to very high percentage, but also
reconstructed large fractions of both a published Escherichia coli
regulatory network from simulated data and a yeast cell cycle
network from real microarray data.

1 INTRODUCTION

Boolean networks were popularized by Stuart Kauffman as models
for genetic regulatory networks (Kauffman, 1969). In this kind of
model, only two states are discriminated (active/inactive) for each
gene. The dynamics of the network can then be described by Boolean
functions. This model works with a very small set of parameters and
thus represents a very stringent application of Occam’s Razor, which
makes it especially suitable for modeling large genetic networks

(Bornholdt, 2005). Nonetheless, it is powerful enough to model the
structure of network motifs, basic network components frequently
found in gene regulatory networks (Alon, 2006; Babu et al., 2004).

Gene transcription in eukaryotic cells has to be tightly regulated
to ensure proper cell function, i.e. according to a particular cellular
context (cell cycle phase, cell type, environmental conditions,
developmental stage), a speciﬁc subset of genes is expressed
while the expression of other genes has to be actively repressed.
This regulation is generally mediated via certain proteins, called
transcription factors, that bind to speciﬁc sequence motifs in
the promoter region of a gene and either enhance or inhibit
the transcription of this gene [reviewed e.g. in (Orphanides and
Reinberg, 2002; Venters and Pugh, 2009)]. If a promoter region
contains binding motifs for different transcription factors, these
factors can either cooperate in the regulation of a certain target
gene or counteract each other. Moreover, in some cases, speciﬁc
cofactors determine whether a transcription factor acts as activator
or repressor. Despite the variety in the modes of transcriptional
regulation, most transcriptional regulators will be either activators
or inhibitors of a certain gene in a speciﬁc cell type. In this case, the
activating or repressing effect of a transcription factor monotonically
depends on its cellular concentration. In other words, an increase in
the concentration of an activator will increase but never decrease
transcription of its target, while an increase in the concentration
of a repressor will decrease but never increase transcription of
its target. This kind of transcriptional regulation can be modeled
mathematically in a very simplistic manner by the use of monotone
Boolean functions which describe exactly this monotonic relation.
Besides the monotone Boolean functions applied in this work, there
exist further related Classes of functions describing such monotonic
relations. Among them are, for example, nested canalyzing functions
(Kauffman et al., 2003), single-layer perceptrons (Rani et al., 2007)
and multilinear functions (Tsukimoto and Hatano, 2003).

Gene expression data can be analyzed and visualized on the
basis of correlations identiﬁed in the observed expression patterns
of the analyzed genes. Models from information theory correlate
expression values from two genes directly and predict an interaction
between two genes to be present if the correlation coefﬁcient is
exceeding a certain threshold. Algorithms based on this principle are
for example CLR (Faith et (11., 2007) or ARACNE (Margolin et al.,
2006). However, these correlations generally reﬂect co-expression
of genes and can, under some restrictions to the underlying network
like e.g. absence of cyclic dependencies, also give information on
direct causal relationships [of (Pearl, 2000; Shipley, 2000; Spirtes
et al., 2000) and references therein]. Moreover, Opgen-Rhein and
Strimmer (2007) and Zoppoli et al. (2010) established algorithms

to develop networks depicting dynamic relations from correlation
data. Likewise, there exist algorithms for the inference of dynamic
Boolean networks from gene expression data, like REVEAL (Liang
et al., 1998) or the best ﬁt extension algorithm (Lahdesmaki et al.,
2003). These algorithms, however, perform reasonably well only if
the datasets are not too large.

In contrast to existing approaches, we do not correlate expression
data of different genes directly, but instead correlate the states of
particular genes with the successive states of potential target genes,
thus assuming and examining directed causal dependencies.

This article is organized as follows: we ﬁrst prove properties
of interaction reconstruction via correlation, assuming monotone
Boolean functions. This is followed by a series of experiments
successively advancing from entirely artiﬁcial through to real data.

2 METHODS—CORRELATION AND MONOTONE
FUNCTIONS

Boolean networks: a Boolean network consists of n nodes. numbered from
1 to n and n functionsf1,...,f,,: {0, 1}” —> {0, l}. The state of the network can
be described by a Boolean vector xe {0, 1}”. where x, describes the state of
the i-th node. The n functions describe the dynamics of the network: If the
network is in state x at time t. it transforms into state (fl(x),f2(x), . . . ,fn(x))
at time t+ 1. We can also combine f1,...,f,, into one function F: {0, l}”—>
{0, 1}” such that F (x), = ,(x). State x then transforms into state F (x). When
considering successive states x(l),x(2), . . .. the term x?) will denote the state
of the i-th node in x0).

Relevance of a variable: a function f : {0, 1}” —> {0,1} depends on the i-th
variable if there exist x1, ...,xi_1 ,xi+1 ,...,x,, such that

f(X1,---,Xi—1,0,Xi+11---,Xn)
75f(X1,---,Xi—1, lixi+11---1Xn)-

If f depends on the i-th input variable. we also say that the i-th variable is
relevant for f. The set of all relevant variables of f is denoted as relQC).

Reconstructing the dynamics of a Boolean network: in order to reconstruct
the functions of a Boolean network. we are given a sequence of m
states x(l),x(2),...,x(’") along with the corresponding successor states
F(x(l)),F(x(2)),...,F(x(’”)). A tuple (x(i),F(x(i))) is also called an example.
From these examples. the task is to reconstruct the dependencies in the
Boolean network. i.e. the set of variables each of the functions depends
on.

Monotonicity of functions: a Boolean function f: {0, 1}” —> {0,1} is
monotonically increasing in the i-th variable if for all X] , . . . ,xi_1 ,xi+1 , . . . ,xn

f(X1~---,Xi—1,Oixi-l—ii-uixn)
Sf(xIv---vxi—Iv 1,Xi+1,---,Xn),

the function f is monotonically decreasing in the i-th variable if for all
variables x1,...,xi_1,xi+1,...,x,,

f(X1,---,Xi—1,0,Xi+11---,Xn)
ZfOCIv-nvxi—lv 1,Xi+11---,Xn)-

A function f is monotone if for every variable f is either monotonically
increasing or monotonically decreasing in that variable. For example. the
Boolean AND function is monotone. while the XOR function is not.

Inﬂuence of a variable: a probability distribution D on {0, 1}” is called
product distribution if for any D-distributed random variable X the property
P[X=(x1,...,x,,)]= H?:1P[X,» =xi] holds. i.e. the X, are independent.

Let D be a product distribution and X be a D-distributed random variable.
The inﬂuence 10,,»(f) ofa variable x, on a functionf: {0, 1}” —> {0, l} is deﬁned
as the probability that a change in x, will also lead to a change in f(X ). i.e.

10,10”) =PD [f(X)lx,-:0 #f(X)lx,-:1] -
Here.f(X)|Xi:0 denotes a partial assignment. i.e.

f(XIv"-erl)IXi:l7=f(Xl7-”7Xi—Ivval‘l-Iv-HVXVL) -

Pearson correlation: given two random variables X and Y. their Pearson
correlation is deﬁned as
E[(X—E[X])(Y—E[Y])] _ Cov(X, Y)

O'XO'Y — UXUY i

90", Y) =

 

where oz denotes the SD of a random variable Z.

THEOREM 1. Given a monotone functionf: {0, l}”—> {0, l} and a random
variable X e {0, 1}” that is distributed according to a product distribution D.
Then the function f depends on the i-th variable if and only if the Pearson
correlation of X, and f (X ) is non-zero for non-zero variances.

PROOF. Let D, denote the product distribution D on all variables except
xi. Then

with a fast algorithm: Algorithm 1 ﬁnds the relevant variables of a

Running that algorithm for the output function of each node of a Boolean

3 SIMULATION RESULTS

Error rates in artiﬁcial networks with ﬁxed in-degree: to investigate
the performance of our method for concrete values and for controlled
noise levels, we analyzed the error probability of our inference
algorithm in an artiﬁcial network consisting of monotone Boolean
functions. For this purpose, we created a set of 50 random Boolean
networks each containing 80 nodes. For every node in these
networks, a monotone function with three input variables was
constructed as follows: ﬁrst, we created a random truth table and
determined randomly for each input variable if the function should
be monotonically increasing or decreasing in that variable. We then
altered the initial truth table by correcting all inconsistencies. If
this resulted in a function that did not depend on all of its input
variables, we created a new random truth table and repeated the
process until every function depended on all of its input variables.
Additionally, for each of the networks generated we analyzed
attractors, i.e. single states or sequences of states toward which
the networks evolve. The network generation and attractor analysis
was performed with the R package BoolNet (Mussel et al., 2010),
with the described modiﬁcation to create monotone functions. We
determined the number of attractors for each of these artiﬁcial
networks via a random sampling of 10 000 starting states and their
resulting attractors (function getAttractors of BoolNet). The number
of attractors ranged from 1 to 59 (with a median of 5.5), with
attractor lengths ranging from 1 to 258 (with median 6). From
each of the 50 random networks, we subsequently generated a batch
of 1000 simulated time-series datasets, with each dataset covering
2 time points. In this process, for the generation of each dataset
a new starting conﬁguration of the network was drawn from a
uniform distribution. The datasets generated in this way for each
of the 50 random networks represent synthetic ‘gene expression’
data of the 80 ‘genes’, measured at two successive time points in an
unperturbed system. These datasets were then used to reconstruct
the dependencies in the underlying artiﬁcial networks. If a Boolean
function depends on three variables, Changing one of these variables
from 0 to 1 must have an effect on f for at least one combination of
the other two variables. Since the probability of such a combination
of two variables is 0.25 under a uniform distribution, each of these
variables has an inﬂuence of at least 0.25. A correlation value was

assumed to signify a dependency when it exceeded a threshold of
0.125, i.e. half the minimum inﬂuence.

Figure 1 shows the average identiﬁcation rates of our method
and Lahdesmaki and co-workers’ best ﬁt extension algorithm
(Lahdesmaki et al., 2003) for the reconstruction of 50 artiﬁcial
Boolean networks. The network size of 80 nodes was chosen to
be able to compare the performance of our approach with the best
ﬁt algorithm. Moreover, to obtain data that is closer to experimental
results, we added a Gaussian noise term with mean 0 and SD 0.4
to the generated data, then rounded to the nearest value in {0,1}.
This corresponds to a probability of about 0.1 for each bit to be
changed to the wrong value. The effect of different noise levels on
network reconstruction is shown in Supplementary Figure S1. For
the best ﬁt algorithm, we used the implementation in the BoolNet R-
package. As seen in Figure 1, for a threshold of 0. 125, the correlation
approach detected 80% and more of the dependencies in the artiﬁcial
network already when less than 200 datasets were used for network
reconstruction, while the best ﬁt algorithm identiﬁed a comparable
portion of dependencies only when more than 200 datasets were
used. However, for this threshold, the correlation approach also
retrieved a fraction of false-positive dependencies, that were not
actually present in the underlying networks. For example, when
using 200 datasets, 25% of the non-present dependencies were
wrongly classiﬁed as present. Thus, the rate of correctly classiﬁed
non-present connections was lower than the true-positive rate, unless
more than 400 datasets were used for network inference (Fig. 1).
We further analyzed precision, i.e. the fraction of true dependencies
among all predicted dependencies, and recall, i.e. the fraction of true
dependencies that was correctly predicted, for our reconstruction
approach and the best ﬁt algorithm. As seen in Supplementary
Figure S5, precision and recall increase for both algorithms with the
number of datasets used for network inference. In the correlation

approach, moreover, the threshold for the correlation can be varied
to determine whether the algorithm should preferably identify
dependencies with a high precision, at the expense of a lower recall,
or the other way round (see Supplementary Fig. S5). As additional
measure for the reliability of network reconstruction, we further
analyzed the F -score, which can be regarded as weighted average
of precision and recall (see Supplementary Fig. S6).

Runtime: in a second experiment, we measured the running time of
the correlation method and the best ﬁt algorithm. The average single-
core runtimes on a 3.0GHz Xeon CPU are given in Table 1. The
random networks for the reconstruction consisted of 50, 100 and 200
nodes, respectively. In each case, we measured the running times for
reconstruction of the random network from 50 synthetic datasets.
The values in the table show the running times averaged over 20
runs, where we created a new random Boolean network for each of
these runs. As seen in Table 1, a key advantage of the correlation
method are the considerably shorter running times compared to the
best ﬁt algorithm. Thus, our correlation approach is especially useful
for large networks in which the nodes have a relatively large in-
degree. For example, the runtime of the best ﬁt algorithm for the
reconstruction of a network of 200 nodes with a maximum in-degree
of 4 (i.e. each Boolean function depends on no more than four input
variables) is almost 3 h, whereas the correlation approach needs only
about 15 s for this task.

Reconstruction of interactions from an E. coli regulatory network:
we next tested the method on a real biological network. For that
purpose, we chose the integrated Escherichia coli gene regulatory
and metabolic network published by Covert et al. (2004). Based
on previously published information, extracted from literature and
databases, the authors of this study constructed a network model
that describes the transcriptional regulation of genes involved
in E.coli metabolism by transcription factors and environmental
stimuli. The complete model includes a total of 1010 genes and
102 environmental stimuli. Of these, 906 genes code for proteins in
the E. coli metabolic network and 104 genes code for transcriptional
regulators. The expression of 479 of the genes is controlled in the
metabolic network, 427 genes were not included in our investigation.
So we used a total 685 (= 479 + 104 + 102) variables in the network,
i.e. the regulated 583 genes and the 102 additional inputs. To
reconstruct the regulatory network, including the environmental
stimuli, we used the Boolean functions provided by Covert et al.
(2004) to generate 20 synthetic time-series datasets covering 3 time
points each. For the generation of each of the 20 datasets, a random
starting conﬁguration of the network was drawn from a uniform
distribution. To every value in all datasets, Gaussian noise with
mean 0 and SD 0.1 was added, to resemble the noise generally

Fig. 2. True positive (solid lines) and true negative (dashed lines) rates of
the correlation approach for reconstruction of a published E.coli regulatory
network with 685 nodes. The network was reconstructed from 2 to 20
synthetic time-series datasets (with 3 time steps). that had been generated
from the network by Covert et al. (2004). Correlations signiﬁed a regulatory
dependency if they exceeded a predeﬁned threshold of 0.2 (circles) or 0.4
(squares).

observed in biological data. Binarization was then performed by
rounding to the nearest Boolean value 0 or 1. We then reconstructed
the dependencies of the published E. coli network from the synthetic
datasets using the described correlation method. To investigate
the inﬂuence of the number of datasets on the reconstruction,
we varied the number of used datasets in the range of 2 to the
available 20 (Fig. 2). By comparing the predicted dependencies with
the published network, ﬁnally, the fraction of correctly classiﬁed
present (true positive) and non-present (true negative) dependencies
was determined. Additionally, we analyzed precision and recall
and F -scores for different thresholds (see Supplementary Figs S7
and S8). As seen in Figure 2, for a threshold value of 0.2, the true
positive rate was close to 75% for network reconstruction from at
least ﬁve datasets. The true negative rate, for this threshold, ranged
between 50% and 80% depending on the number of datasets used
for reconstruction. Thus, at this threshold a large fraction (~ 75%)
of the actual dependencies was found. To increase precision of the
correlation approach, a higher threshold can be applied. So, for a
threshold of 0.4, the true positive rate still was close to 60%, and in
this case the true negative rate was higher than 80% already when
ﬁve datasets were used for reconstruction (Fig. 2). Examples of
reconstructed interactions for different dataset sizes and thresholds
are given as Supplementary Material II.

To further evaluate how reliably the correlation of successive
states identiﬁed true relevant variables of the examined Boolean
functions, we additionally computed the area under the receiver
operator curve (AUC; Fawcett, 2006). The AUC is equal to the
probability that a randomly chosen present dependency has a higher
absolute correlation value than a randomly chosen non-existing
dependency. For computation of the AUC values, we performed 25

independent network reconstruction runs. For each reconstruction
run, we generated a ﬁxed number of 10 datasets of length 3
from the Boolean network of Covert et al. (2004) by choosing
starting states randomly. In each run, we calculated the respective
correlation values for all potential dependencies. This generates
25 ><583(= 14575) AUC values (583 genes are dependent). One
AUC value is determined by calculating all correlations of one of
the 583 dependent genes to the 685 variables that are potentially
inﬂuencing them and utilizing all possible thresholds. From these
values, we generated histograms separated by the number of either
1, 2, 3 or more than 3 input variables (Fig. 3). For Boolean functions
with only one input variable (representing genes which are regulated
by just one factor), the correlation method identiﬁed the relevant
variables with very high reliability. For functions with several
input variables (representing genes which are regulated by several
factors), the fraction of smaller AUC values increased, but a large
fraction is still close to 1.

Interactions of the yeast cell cycle transcriptional network: ﬁnally,
we used the correlation method to reconstruct a biological network
from microarray data. For that purpose, we chose the cell cycle
transcriptional network of budding yeast, as suggested by Orlando
et al. (2008), and used published microarray results from three
groups (Cho et al., 1998; Pramila et al., 2006; Spellman et al., 1998)
for network reconstruction. All three studies represent genome-wide
analyses of gene expression during the cell cycle in synchronized
yeast cells, but they differ in the applied synchronization methods
and the time intervals at which transcript levels were measured.
In a ﬁrst step, we binarized each of these microarray datasets
with the 2-means algorithm, the version of the k-means clustering
algorithm that generates k=2 clusters. Next, we created a set of

example pairs, i.e. each example contained the state of the network
at a certain time point along with a succeeding state measured
after a speciﬁc time period. As the time lag between regulator
expression and target expression varies considerably in the data, we
grouped the sample pairs according to the intervals: the short time
lag group contained all examples where the following states were
measured after a period of 5—1 0 min, the intermediate time lag group
contained the examples with the following states measured after 14—
21min, and the long time lag group contained the examples with
the following states measured after 25—30 min. Thus, for network
reconstruction we regarded subsequent states with a time lag of
up to about one fourth of the yeast’s cell cycle, which is assumed
to span a time of about 135 min (Orlando et al., 2008). For each
of the 16 genes with known dependencies in the published cell
cycle transcriptional network, we computed the correlation to the
other genes in the cell cycle network and also added 16 randomly
chosen additional genes contained in all of the microarray datasets.
This was done to distort the reconstruction process and to evaluate
the detection of non-present dependencies. A computed correlation
was assumed to represent a dependency, if it exceeded the mean of
all correlations either by at least 1 SD for at least one of the time
lag groups or by at least half the SD for at least two of the time
lag groups. This evaluation was repeated for a total of 25 times,
each time choosing a new set of 16 additional genes at random.
For comparison, we also applied the best ﬁt extension algorithm to
the same data. This algorithm was run on the data corresponding
to each of the three time lag groups, and for maximum in-degrees
of 3, 4 and 5.

Figure 4 shows the correctly identiﬁed dependencies in the
yeast transcription factor network (Orlando et al., 2008). Assuming

that this published network correctly and fully represents the real
biological situation, our correlation inference approach correctly
identiﬁed an average of 74.7% of the present dependencies and
59.1% of non-present dependencies for the described threshold. In
comparison, Lahdesmaki and co-workers’ best ﬁt algorithm found
61.1% of the present dependencies and 38.8% of the non-present
dependencies. This best result was achieved with a maximum in-
degree of 5 and interpreting a dependency as present when it
was found for at least one of the three time lag groups. The
identiﬁcation rates of the best ﬁt algorithm for different maximum in-
degrees are given in the Supplementary Material I. Additionally, we
analyzed precision and recall as well as F -scores for correlation and
best ﬁt algorithm, applying different thresholds for the correlation.
In these analyses we found, that the initially chosen threshold
of ‘mean:l:1SD’ provided a reasonable balance between recall
and precision (see Supplementary Figs S9 and S10). An example
of the interactions found by the described analysis are given in
Supplementary Material III. Here, an interaction was included if it
occurred in the majority of the 25 simulations. Finally, we examined
differences in precision and recall, when each of the three time
lag groups was used separately for network reconstruction (see
Supplementary Fig. S12).

4 DISCUSSION

Under the assumption that a Boolean network consists of monotone
functions, we have shown that its dependencies can be reconstructed
via Pearson correlation of subsequent states. Compared for instance
to the best ﬁt extension algorithm, correlations have the important
advantage that they can be computed very quickly—for each pair
of nodes, only two correlations for the two possible directed
dependencies have to be computed, where the running time for
the computation of a single correlation is linear in the number of
samples. This leads to an overall running time of the order 0(n2m),
where n is the number of nodes and m the number of samples. In
contrast, an exhaustive search algorithm like the best ﬁt algorithm
considers all subsets of genes up to a given size, assuming the
functions of the network have an input degree of k, for each node of
the network  combinations of input nodes have to be considered,

which leads to a running time of the order 0(nk+1m). This is also
reﬂected in Table 1: for k=3, doubling the number of nodes in
the network increases the runtime of the best ﬁt algorithm by a
factor of 16, while it increases the runtime of the correlation method
only by a factor of 4. So while the exhaustive search approach is
only feasible for networks with a small number of nodes or low
input degrees, the correlation method can also be applied to large
networks. This is particularly interesting for biological applications,
as in the context of microarray and deep-sequencing technologies
this type of large-scale data becomes more available.

Theoretically, dependencies in the examples violate the
assumption of Theorem 1. In an experimental evaluation
(Supplementary Figs S2—S4), we found that these dependencies
only marginally inﬂuence the reconstruction process as long as these
dependencies are not too strong (visually discernible only for bias
probabilities greater than 0.8).

While our new method is to some extent similar to using
the Fourier transform, it does not need the Fourier transform’s
mathematical overhead (Bshouty and Tamon, 1996; Mossel et al.,
2003). We do not see any speciﬁc advantage of moving from the

time domain into the spectral domain, as the values are (in the case
of the Fourier transform) hard to interpret. We think that the notion
of a correlation value is much more intuitive.

Our experiments on the randomly created artiﬁcial networks have
shown that for noisy data and a low number of samples, Pearson
correlation still ﬁnds a high percentage of the dependencies and,
for a range of thresholds, even surpasses the best ﬁt algorithm with
regard to recall, precision and F -score (see Fig. 1, Supplementary
Figs S5 and S6). A further advantage of our approach, besides the
short running times, is the possibility to vary the threshold according
to the desired outcome, i.e. whether a high recall or rather a high
precision are requested. In case of little or no previous knowledge,
for example, preferably a high threshold should be applied so that
dependencies can be assumed with a high reliability, while a lower
threshold can be applied, if more previous knowledge exists that can
help to (pre-)select meaningful dependencies.

For the simulated E. coli network, we also could reconstruct more
than 50% of the present and non-present dependencies, already from
a relatively low number of datasets (Fig. 2). The comparison of
the areas under the ROCs indicate that especially for functions
that depend only on one or two variables, dependencies can be
found reliably. For functions depending on more variables, the
identiﬁcation of dependencies is more complicated, but the AUCs
show that the correlation method still is able to provide information
about these dependencies (Fig. 3). One reason for the increased
difﬁculty when reconstructing functions with higher in-degree is the
fact that for higher in-degree, variables can have a lower inﬂuence
and dependencies are therefore harder to detect. In addition, the set
of Boolean functions can be partitioned into sets of varying difﬁculty
for a learning algorithm [of Gordon and Peretto (1990)]. This
partition, however, also depends to a large extent on the in-degree
of the functions.

Furthermore, we could show that Pearson correlation also
performed reasonably well when reconstructing dependencies from
real biological data, reaching identiﬁcation rates (true positive,
true negative) similar to those for the simulated E.coli datasets.
Compared to the best ﬁt algorithm, interactions were not only
identiﬁed faster using correlation, but the identiﬁcation was also
more reliable. As seen also in Figure 4, almost 75% of the assumed
dependencies could be correctly identiﬁed at the chosen threshold,
in spite of the regulatory complexity of the yeast cell cycle network,
even for components regulated by more than three factors (like
Swi4, Swi6 or thl). Further examining which of the expected
dependencies were not identiﬁed by our method, we ﬁnd that
in these cases the regulatory mechanisms are based on a quite
complex interplay of several factors involved. So, for example,
Cln3 can activate transcription of Swi6 through inactivation of
the transcriptional repressor Whi5 as well as independent of Whi5
(Wittenberg and Reed, 2005), and the Whi5-independent mechanism
might hamper identiﬁcation of the inhibitory inﬂuence of Whi5
on Swi6. A second example is the transcriptional activator Mcml,
which can act in concert with an activating transcription factor
complex consisting of Fkh2/Ndd1 or the transcriptional repressors
thl and Yoxl (Wittenberg and Reed, 2005). Accordingly, the
inﬂuence of Mcml, which was mostly not identiﬁed by our
method, is strongly dependent on the presence of the respective co-
factors, for which our approach correctly identiﬁed the respective
dependencies. With regard to the reconstruction from real data,
it has to be kept in mind that we cannot be completely sure

that the published network whose interactions we are rebuilding
exactly matches the real in vivo situation. Thus, for example, some
identiﬁed dependencies, that were assumed to be false positives,
might actually be real dependencies. In line with this reasoning,
the precision of network reconstruction was indeed lower for the
reconstruction from real data, for both the best-ﬁt and the correlation
algorithm. Furthermore, it has to be kept in mind, that correlations
representing indirect effects within the cell cycle also were counted
as false positives, while they do actually confer some biological
meaning.

In addition, Pearson correlation is not only suitable for measuring
the dependencies between sequences of binarized values. Especially
when real-valued examples are difﬁcult to binarize, applying
Pearson correlation directly on the raw, non-binarized data might
already give some valuable information about a network.

5 CONCLUSION

For a Boolean network consisting only of monotone Boolean
functions, we showed that Pearson correlation is a fast method to
ﬁnd dependencies in the network. This method makes it possible to
analyze large networks that contain nodes with large input degree.
We could show for both simulated and real microarray data that
our approach could reconstruct large parts of published regulatory
networks.

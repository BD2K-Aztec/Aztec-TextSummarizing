Abstract

Motivation: Coalescent—based simulation software for genomic sequences allows the efficient in
silico generation of short— and medium—sized genetic sequences. However, the simulation of gen—
ome—size datasets as produced by next—generation sequencing is currently only possible using

fairly crude approximations.

Results: We present the sequential coalescent with recombination model (SCRM), a new method
that efficiently and accurately approximates the coalescent with recombination, closing the gap be—
tween current approximations and the exact model. We present an efficient implementation and
show that it can simulate genomic—scale datasets with an essentially correct linkage structure.
Availability and implementation: The open source implementation scrm is freely available at
https://scrm.github.io underthe conditions ofthe GPLV3 license.

1 Introduction

Coalescent simulation is a valuable tool to investigate population
genetic data and the demographic processes that shaped them.
Simulation programs based on the coalescent with recombination
(CWR) such as ms (Hudson, 2002) support a wide range of evolu-
tionary scenarios and are extremely efficient for short- and medium-
sized sequences. As the number of recombination events grows ex-
ponentially with increasing sequence length, it is however infeasible
to simulate whole chromosomes using these methods. This prevents
many methods relying on simulations from being applicable to next-
generation sequencing datasets.

In order to resolve this problem, McVean and Cardin (2005)
introduced the sequentially Markov coalescence (SMC) model, a
method that approximates the CWR by partially ignoring genetic
linkage between simulated sites. Subsequently, Marjoram and Wall
(2006) proposed a modification of this model, termed SMC’, which

improved accuracy. The simulation programs MaCS (Chen et (11.,
2009) and fastsinicoal (Excoffier and F011, 2011) implement SMC’
and allow rapid simulation of chromosome-sized datasets.
However, Eriksson et a1. (2009) found that the decrease in genetic
linkage depends on the simulated evolutionary model, which led
then] to conclude that SMC’ might not be suitable under certain
conditions, and suggested that the effect of the approximation
needed to be investigated carefully in each application.

We have developed a novel approximation of the CWR, called
the sequential coalescent with recombination model (SCRM).
Besides algorithmic optimization, it allows for user-controlled arbi-
trary precision ranging continuously from SMC’ to the full CWR.
We here present an efficient implementation of this model, termed
scrm, and show that by using an intermediate approximation level it
allows the simulation of sequences of arbitrary length with an essen-
tially correct linkage structure.

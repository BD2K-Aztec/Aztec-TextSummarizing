ABSTRACT

Motivation: With the advancement of high-throughput techniques,
large-scale profiling of biological systems with multiple experimental
perturbations is becoming more prevalent. Pathway analysis incorp-
orates prior biological knowledge to analyze genes/proteins in groups
in a biological context. However, the hypotheses under investigation
are often confined to a 1D space (i.e. up, down, either or mixed
regulation). Here, we develop direction pathway analysis (DPA),
which can be applied to test hypothesis in a high-dimensional space
for identifying pathways that display distinct responses across multiple
perturbations.

Results: Our DPA approach allows for the identiﬁcation of pathways
that display distinct responses across multiple perturbations. To dem-
onstrate the utility and effectiveness, we evaluated DPA under various
simulated scenarios and applied it to study insulin action in adipo-
cytes. A major action of insulin in adipocytes is to regulate the move-
ment of proteins from the interior to the cell surface membrane.
Quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics was used to
study this process on a large-scale. The combined dataset comprises
four separate treatments. By applying DPA, we identified that several
insulin responsive pathways in the plasma membrane trafficking
are only partially dependent on the insulin-regulated kinase Akt. We
subsequently validated our findings through targeted analysis of
key proteins from these pathways using immunoblotting and live cell
microscopy. Our results demonstrate that DPA can be applied to dis-
sect pathway networks testing diverse hypotheses and integrating
multiple experimental perturbations.

1 INTRODUCTION

Pathway analysis has become a key approach to incorporate
prior knowledge for interpreting ‘-omics’ scaled data generated
from high-throughput techniques such as microarray, RNA-seq
and quantitative mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics.
It has the advantage of leveraging high dimensionality and
limited replicates by organizing genes and proteins into groups
and analyzing them in biological meaningful contexts (Nam and
Kim, 2008).

To date, numerous pathway analysis approaches have been
proposed (Emmert—Streib and Glazko, 2011) and several taxo-
nomies have been described to categorize them (Ackermann and
Strimmer, 2009; Goeman and Biihlmann, 2007; Huang et al.,
2009; Irizarry et al., 2009). One of the popular categorization
approaches is to classify pathway analysis methods as using
an over-representation approach or aggregate score approach
(Irizarry et al., 2009). The over-representation approach, exem-
pliﬁed by hypergeometric test using Gene Ontology (GO)
(Khatri and Draghici, 2005; Rivals et al., 2007), requires a pre-
selected list of differentially expressed (DE) genes to be supplied
before the test. It could be sensitive to the cut-off applied to select
DE genes (Irizarry et al., 2009). The aggregate score approach,
exempliﬁed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (Mootha
et al., 2003; Subramanian et al., 2005), alleviates this requirement
by considering statistics associated with all genes for testing path-
way differential regulation.

There are several recent extensions on pathway analysis. These
include the extensions from univariate to multivariate statistics
such as the use of Hotelling’s T2-statistics and N—statistics
(Klebanov et al., 2007; Kong et al., 2006) and from single ana-
lysis to meta-analysis such as combining results from multiple
studies (Shen and Tseng, 2010), different platforms (Poisson
et al., 2011) and/or multiple methods (Varemo et al., 2013).
Nevertheless, current pathway analysis methodologies are
mainly designed for testing hypotheses in a 1D space and focus
on identifying pathways that show up, down, either or mixed
differential regulations. Due to the growing complexity of
large-scale experiments where multiple treatments are applied,
for example, to dissect the signalling networks, a novel pathway
analysis approach that can incorporate multiple perturbations
into a single statistical analysis is desirable.

Direction pathway analysis

 

The broad term experimental perturbations is used to describe
any situation in which a cell has been agitated and its reaction
quantiﬁed. Practically speaking when referring to multiple ex-
perimental perturbations, we may be referring to quantifying
the effects of a treatment versus control at various cellular
levels (DNA, RNA, protein). We could also consider multiple
experimental perturbations to refer to various treatment com-
parisons at the same cellular level.

In this study, we propose direction pathway analysis (DPA)
for integrating multiple perturbations in pathway analysis.
This method integrates multiple experimental perturbations by
coupling coordinate rotation with P—Value combination tech-
niques. It extends on traditional pathway analysis in the follow-
ing aspects:

0 The method increases statistical power by integrating mul-
tiple perturbations for testing in a high-dimensional space.

0 The method improves biological interpretability by translat-
ing a biological question into a direction-speciﬁc test,
broadening the hypothesis space and allowing many more
biological questions to be investigated.

0 The method is ﬂexible and can be extended to n-dimensions,
where n is the number of experimental perturbations.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of P—Value combination tech-
niques at answering various alternative hypotheses, we designed
and performed a set of simulation studies. These studies offer
insight into the selection of an appropriate combination tech-
nique for DPA in integrating information on testing pathway
enrichment.

To explore the utility of the method, we applied this approach
to MS-based proteomics data obtained from adipocytes aiming
to identify insulin action pathways under various treatments.
Adipocytes are one of the major targets of insulin action in mam-
mals. One of the major pathways downstream of the insulin
receptor is the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)—Akt path-
way (Engelman et al., 2006; Manning and Cantley, 2007). To
date, the majority of evidence points towards Akt alone being
sufﬁcient to elicit the majority of insulin’s intracellular
actions (Ng et al., 2008). However, there are PI3K-dependent
Akt-independent pathways that are activated by insulin stimula-
tion (Choi et al., 2010) and it is possible that such pathways may
also regulate protein trafﬁcking events in response to insulin. To
dissect PI3K-Akt pathways and determine the contributions of
Akt-independent and Akt-dependent pathways, we used various
pharmacological agents to target different signal transduction
nodes and subsequently performed plasma membrane puriﬁca-
tion and SILAC—based (Ong et al., 2002) quantitative proteomic
proﬁling (Ong and Mann, 2005). By analyzing the proteomic
proﬁle using DPA, we identiﬁed that several pathways were
enriched in the plasma membrane following insulin stimulation,
and that these trafﬁcking events were strongly dependent on
PI3K signalling. However, the translocation of these pathways
was not fully blocked in the presence of an Akt inhibitor, sug-
gesting that there are Akt-independent pathways that promote
membrane trafﬁcking events in response to insulin. We validated
these ﬁndings through targeted analysis of several key proteins
from these insulin-regulated pathways using immunoblotting
and live cell microscopy.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Direction pathway analysis

In this study, we propose a novel approach, called DPA, for a direc-
tion-speciﬁc pathway test (Fig. 1). Our approach consists of three main
steps:

(1) Rotating a matrix of test statistics such that large values of the test
statistics provide evidence against the null hypothesis in favour of
the alternative;

(2) Combining the statistics across multiple experimental perturb-
ations for each protein using a P-value combination method; and

(3) Combining the statistics across proteins within a pathway using a
P-value combination method.

The novelty of this approach is the concept of P-value rotation for
testing pathways in a speciﬁc direction and the tandem application
of P-value combination methods for integrating information across
multiple experimental perturbations of each protein (protein level
integration) and multiple proteins within a pathway (pathway level
integration).

2.1.] P—value combination There are many methodologies for
combining information across studies or within pathways and the key
discriminating differences between many of these methods are their
assumed alternative hypotheses (Tseng et al., 2012). Let 1:]- represent
test statistics for j = 1, 2, . . . ,n, where n are the number of tests.
Assume the null hypothesis that none features measured by these test
statistics have changed (H0 : 1:]- : 0, Vj = 1,2, ...,n). Li and Tseng
(2011) proposed to classify different alternative hypotheses into two
broad classes H A and H 3. Alternative hypothesis H A is used to detect a
series of tests in which all the tests have changed (HA : rj>0, V j =
1, 2, . . . ,n). Alternative hypothesis H3 is used to detect a series of tests
in which any of the tests have changed (H B : 1:]- >0, for at least one j in
1, 2, . . . , n).

For our DPA, we would like to identify pathways that have had any of
their proteins changed in all experimental perturbations in the direction
of interest. When put in the context of P-value combination, this would
then require the tandem use of combination methods that favourable
to testing H0 against H A when combining across experimental perturb-
ations and H0 against H B when combining within a pathway, respectively.

In our proposed DPA approach, we utilize Stouffer’s method (Stouffer
et al., 1949) to combine within pathways. This is deﬁned as

1 n
ff :cp — qu -
Stou er  (171)),

where <1>(.) is the cumulative distribution function for the standard
normal distribution and for independent P-values p], j = 1, ...,n. To
combine across experimental perturbations, we will use a one-sided
version of Pearson’s method (Pearson, 1934), OSP, deﬁned as

n
OSP : P<X§n < — 2Zlog(1—pj)).
j:1
This method is not that proposed by Pearson (1934) but is mentioned in
later work (Pearson, 1938).

The combined P-values for Stouffer converge to zero if any one of the p,
also converges to zero making it appropriate for testing H0 against the
alternative H B. For OSP to converge to zero, all p, must converge to zero,
thus making it appropriate for testing H0 against the alternative H A.
To demonstrate the behaviour of the P-value combination methods and
justify the selection of appropriate ones for our application, further
explanation and a set of simulation studies were performed (see Section
1 of Supplementary File).

2.1.2 Rotation and combination Our DPA takes as input three
vectors of test statistics. The left panel of Figure 1 describes how these
statistics may be generated and processed before performing the three
main steps of DPA (the right panel of Fig. 1). This process is described
more formally as follows. Deﬁne a matrix of test statistics 1:, where 1,,- is
the test statistic for the ith protein, i = 1, 2, . . . , np, in one of three experi-
mental perturbations, j = 1,2,3. Let t,-, correspond to the observed 1,].
These test statistics have most likely come from multiple two-sample
t-tests but could be other statistics such as regression coefﬁcients. We
assume that a subset of these proteins belong to pathway 73, and that
the 1,,- are independent, which may not be the case in practice. The test
statistics 1,,- may not be identically distributed. They can be converted into
identically distributed z-scores, z,,~, which are easier to manipulate by ﬁrst
evaluating their corresponding one-sided probabilities pi,- = P('l:,-,->t,—,-).
The matrix of z-scores are then deﬁned as 2,-1- = —<1>’1(p,-j), where

DPA tests if any of the proteins in pathway 73 have deviated from the
null hypothesis in the direction of the alternative hypothesis. A speciﬁc
example may be written as

H0: 1,1=0,‘l:;2=0,‘l:i3=0;foralli673
H1: ri1>0,r,2<0,r,-3=0;foranyi673,

(1)

testing if any proteins in pathway 73 have been upregulated in the ﬁrst
perturbation, downregulated in the second perturbation and remain un-
changed in the third perturbation. The three steps of rotation, combination
at protein level and combination at pathway level are outlined in the right
panel of Figure 1 and described in more detail in the following:

Step 1. The matrix 2 is rotated such that large values within 2 provide
evidence against the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative
hypothesis. This is achieved as follows:

(a) Represent the direction of the alternative hypothesis using the
unit vector v 2 (v1, vz, V3) where each element corresponds to
the direction of interest in the experimental perturbation. If con-
sidering the example test described in Equation (1) then v would
be deﬁned as v =(1/f, —1/J2,0).

(b) Represent the direction that we would like to rotate to as
u = (141,142,143) 2 (IA/3, 1/«/3,1/\/3) and calculate the angle
between 11 and v as 6 = cos’1(u>v) = cos’1(u1v1 + u2v2 + 143 v3).

(c) Let a = u x v 2 (run — u3v2, u3v1— u1V3,u1v2 — mm), which is
a vector that is orthogonal to u and v.

(d) We can then deﬁne R as the matrix for a clockwise rotation
around the vector at by an angle of 6 as

0, —a3,a2 a1—1,a1a2,a1a3
R = I+s1n9 (13,0, — L11 +(I—COSQ) a1a2,a% — 1,0203 . 
2
—a2,01,0 a103,€12£l3,£l3 —1

(e) We deﬁne z’”“1 = zRT as the rotated z-scores.

Step 2. Now that the z-scores are orientated in the direction of interest,
they can be combined across experimental perturbations to provide
evidence that each protein is DE in the direction described by the
alternative hypothesis H1. The rotated z-scores are combined using
OSP for each protein to form the vectors ppm and 21”” as follows:

3
ppmt : P(Xg < _ 22: log(l — q)(—zl’.j"m))) . (3)

,:1

These protein signiﬁcance values can then be converted back to
z-scores by evaluating this combined P-value with respect to the
upper tail of the normal distribution

met = _q)71(ppmt)i 

Step 3. We can then test if a pathway 73 is differentially regulated in the
direction described by the alternative hypothesis H1 using Stouffer’s
method. The z-scores can be combined for each pathway as follows:

2.2 Methods for quantifying insulin action in plasma
membrane trafﬁcking

We collected data generated from our previous study (Prior et al., 2011)
and performed new proteomic proﬁling experiment in this study with
additional treatments (Fig. 2). In the previous experiment, cultured
3T3-L1 ﬁbroblasts were left unlabelled (‘light’), SILAC labelled with
13C6-arginine and 2H4-lysine (‘medium’) or 13C6-15N4-arginine and
13C6-15N2-lysine (‘heavy’). The cells cultured with 13C6-arginine and
2H4-lysine were stimulated with 100 nM insulin for 20 min and the
cells cultured with 13C6-15N4-arginine and 13C6-15N2-lysine were treated
with 100 nM wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor, for 20 min before insulin
stimulation. The unlabelled cell culture was left unstimulated to establish
basal condition. In this study, a second set of plasma membrane prote-
omic proﬁling experiments were performed with a similar procedure as
described earlier in text except that the ‘light’ cells were treated with
10 uM MK-2206, an Akt inhibitor (Tan et al., 2011), for 30 min before
the stimulation of insulin (100 nM) for 20 min, ‘Medium’ cells were left
unstimulated as basal condition and ‘Heavy’ cells were treated with 0.1%
DMSO for 30 min before the addition of 100 nM insulin for 20 min. After
establishing multiple treatments, cell lysates were mixed with ratio 1:1:1 in
both sets of experiments, and subcellular fractionation were performed to
enrich plasma membrane fraction. MS-based proﬁling was conducted
using a LTQ-FT Ultra mass spectrometer and an Orbitrap Velos mass
spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). The combined dataset was
quantiﬁed using MaxQuant (Cox and Mann, 2008) and 997 proteins
were quantiﬁed in all treatments.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Direction pathway analysis on insulin action in plasma
membrane proteome trafﬁcking

The PI3K-Akt pathway serves as a crucial channel for insulin-
regulated processes in adipocytes. This pathway contains two key
nodes; the lipid kinase PI3K (Engelman et al., 2006) and the pro-
tein kinase Akt (Manning and Cantley, 2007). Akt has been re-
ported to phosphorylate numerous substrates to elicit the control
over the numerous cellular processes regulated by insulin. While
much of insulin’s actions are attributed to the combined action of
the PI3K/Akt axis, little work has been done to establish the role
of PI3K and/or Akt independent pathways in these processes.
DPA could be applied as an exploratory tool for dissecting the
relative requirement for PI3K and Akt in the insulin response in
pathways associated with plasma membrane proteome. To this
end, we performed large-scale plasma membrane proteome quan-
tiﬁcation using a quantitative MS-based protoemics approach
with SILAC labelling and subcellular fractionation. The PI3K
and Akt nodes were pharmacologically inhibited using wortman-
nin (Arcaro and Wymann, 1993) or MK-2206 (Tan et al., 2011),
respectively, before insulin stimulation, and the protein abun-
dance on the cell plasma membrane were quantiﬁed according
to the peak intensity from SILAC label. Let the test statistics
1,1, 1,2 and 1,3 represent the comparisons of basal condition to
the treatment of (i) insulin alone; (ii) wortmannin before insulin;
and (iii) MK-2206 before insulin, respectively, for the ith protein.
With these panels of perturbations, we are interested in testing the
following three scenarios described by Tests 1, 2 and 3:

0 Test 1. A pathway 73 enriched within the plasma membrane
after insulin stimulation (‘>’) and this enrichment is reduced
to a negative level by prior inhibition of PI3K (‘<’) but
remain unaffected by Akt. These are PI3K-dependent,
Akt-independent events.

0 Test 2. A pathway 73 enriched within the plasma membrane
after insulin stimulation and this enrichment is reduced to a
negative level by prior inhibition of PI3K but only to the
unstimulated level by Akt (‘2’). These are PI3K-dependent,
partially Akt-dependent events.

Note that by ‘reduced to a negative level’ we mean the inhib-
ition not only blocks the insulin simulation but also removes any
residual insulin effect compared with the unstimulated condition.
Therefore, this effect is denoted as ‘<’. The hypotheses under
testing in the aforementioned three scenarios are Visualized in
Figure 3.

At the individual protein level, DPA prioritizes proteins based
on the z—score calculated from OSP across conditions (Fig. 3).
The most significant proteins from the tests are coloured in red,
whereas the least signiﬁcant ones are in purple. The top ranked
proteins are listed under the panel of each tested directions
(Fig. 3). These proteins include Syntaxins (Syntaxin—6,
Syntaxin—7, Syntaxin—8 and Syntaxin—12) and vesicle-associated
membrane proteins (VAMP2, VAMP3 and VAMP8) from the
family of SNARE proteins, as well as several other proteins
known to localize with intracellular glucose transporter vesicles
including GLUT4 itself and the transferrin receptor (TfR). Also
highly ranked are the lipid phosphate phosphohydrolase 2
(PPAP2A) and lipid phosphate phosphohydrolase 3 (PPAP2B),
which regulate the glycerolipid synthesis and have been reported
to be involved in signal transduction at the plasma membrane
(Nanjundan and Possmayer, 2001).

Interestingly, many pathways associated with vesicle trafficking
and lipolysis are highly enriched described by Test 2 (Table 1).
These include Proteolytic cleavage of SNARE complex proteins,
clathrin derived vesicle budding, golgi associated vesicle biogenesis,
membrane traﬂicking and lysosome vesicle biogenesis which
are primarily associated with insulin-dependent glucose trans-
port, the primary action of insulin in adipocytes. Two pathways,
Sphingolipid metabolism and Triglyceride biosynthesis, are asso-
ciated with lipolysis, a process that is also known to be regulated
by the PI3K-Akt pathway in response to insulin stimulation.
These results indicate that protein molecules from these pathways
are enriched within the plasma membrane with insulin stimula-
tion, and while the inhibition of PI3K using wortmannin signiﬁ-
cantly abolished their enrichment, the inhibition of Akt using
MK-2206 only had a partial effect. This implies that while insulin
actions are largely dependent on the canonical activation of PI3K
and Akt, there may exist a PI3K-dependent, but Akt-independent
branch of the insulin signalling that plays a signiﬁcant but less

dominant role in insulin-regulated protein trafﬁcking. The com-
plete list of pathways analysis results on the three tested directions
is included in the Supplementary Table.

To experimentally validate the PI3K-dependent and partial
Akt-dependent effect suggested by PDA analysis of plasma
membrane proteome, several key proteins from these enriched
pathways were selected for immunoblotting and live cell imaging.

3.2 Validating PI3K-dependent and partial Akt-dependent
regulations

Using DPA, we discovered that many pathways associated
with vesicle trafﬁcking and glucose translocation in adipocytes
are regulated by insulin in a PI3K-dependent and partially Akt-
dependent manner. Here, we select several key proteins from
these pathways to validate the results from DPA analysis.

3.2.] Immunoblotting of traﬁcking proteins Immunoblotting
analysis demonstrated that the cytosolic protein tubulin was
absent from the plasma membrane fraction, whereas a known

plasma membrane protein cadherin was highly enriched
(Fig. 4b). This conﬁrms that the plasma membrane isolation
method resulted in a pure membrane fraction. Compared with
the loading control of 14-3-3, insulin treatment led to increased
phosphorylation of Akt at pThr308 and its downstream
substrates pThr642 ASl60 and pSer246 PRAS40 (Fig. 4a).
Pretreatment of cells with either the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin
or the Akt inhibitor MK-2206 completely abolished Akt phos-
phorylation and its activity as demonstrated by complete dimin-
ution of substrate phosphorylation (Fig. 4a). These data indicate
that these inhibitors completely block PI3K or Akt activity.

To validate our observation from DPA results that many
insulin-responsive trafﬁcking events are PI3K-dependent, but
partial Akt-dependent (Fig. 3), we chose two key vesicle trafﬁck-
ing proteins, Syntaxin—6 and VAMP2, for immunoblotting.
Syntaxin—6 and VAMP2 are members of the SNARE family of
proteins and are known to regulate GLUT4 trafﬁcking in
3T3-L1 adipocytes (Perera et al., 2003; Zhao et al., 2009). As
expected, insulin treatment increased plasma membrane levels

of both Syntaxin—6 and VAMP2, and wortmannin treatment
abolished the effect of insulin (Fig. 4c and d). In agreement
with the DPA results from proteomics experiments, Syntaxin—6
and VAMP2 had higher levels at the plasma membrane
when treated with the MK-2206 compared with wortmannin
(Fig. 4c and (1).

3.2.2 Live cell microscopy of transporter proteins We next
sought to further validate this phenomenon by using live cell
microscopy. In adipocytes, one of the most physiologically im-
portant insulin responsive trafficking events is the translocation
of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) to
the plasma membrane. The TfR has also been reported to traf-
ﬁck to the plasma membrane in an insulin-responsive manner.
Both of two proteins ranked highly in our DPA results (Fig. 3a
and b). Given an incomplete inhibition of the SNARE protein
trafﬁcking (e.g. Syntaxin—6 and VAMP2) to the plasma mem-
brane in the presence of MK-2206, we next determined whether
this pattern also held true for GLUT4 and TfR translocation
events. We made use of a dual colour GLUT4 construct and
TfR constructs (Burchfield et al., 2012) as read outs for
GLUT4 and TfR translocation, respectively.

In the time course live cell microscopy experiment, insulin
robustly increased GLUT4 and TfR plasma membrane levels
(Fig. 5). Wortmannin completely inhibited insulin mediated
GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane, whereas
MK-2206 exhibited only partial inhibition (Fig. 50). A similar
trend was also observed for TfR translocation to the plasma
membrane (Fig. 5d).

4 CONCLUSION

In this study, we developed DPA for detecting biologically
relevant pathways under multiple experimental perturbations.
This method tests a hypothesis by rotating the test statistics
and combining across both proteins and multiple experimental
perturbations using P—Value combination. Compared with

traditional pathway analysis, DPA allows many more biological
questions formulated as an alternative hypothesis and tested dir-
ectly. We subsequently applied DPA to identify pathways that
are signiﬁcantly enriched at the plasma membrane in response to
insulin stimulation and differentially inhibited by different inhibi-
tors with the goal of dissecting insulin-regulated processes and
their dependence on PI3K and Akt kinases. By examining a
speciﬁc alternative hypothesis, we identiﬁed several key regula-
tory pathways to be plasma membrane enriched in a PI3K-de-
pendent and partial Akt-dependent way. We then validated the
key proteins in these pathways using immunoblotting and live
cell microscopy techniques. Collectively, this study demonstrates
the usefulness of the proposed DPA approach to aid the analysis
of global datasets generated from experiments consisting of mul-
tiple perturbations. In this case, DPA helped identify and dissect
the key signalling nodes of insulin regulation in adipocytes.

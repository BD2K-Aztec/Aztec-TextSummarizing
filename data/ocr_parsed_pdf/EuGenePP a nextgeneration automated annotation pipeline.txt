ABSTRACT

Summary: It is now easy and increasingly usual to produce oriented
RNA-Seq data as a prokaryotic genome is being sequenced.
However, this information is usually just used for expression quantiﬁ-
cation. EuGene-PP is a fully automated pipeline for structural annota-
tion of prokaryotic genomes integrating protein similarities, statistical
information and any oriented expression information (RNA-Seq or tiling
arrays) through a variety of file formats to produce a qualitatively en-
riched annotation including coding regions but also (possibly anti-
sense) non-coding genes and transcription start sites.

Availability and implementation: EuGene-PP is an open-source soft-
ware based on EuGene-P integrating a Galaxy configuration. EuGene-
PP can be downloaded at eugene.tou|ouse.inra.fr.

1 INTRODUCTION

Prokaryotic genome sequencing and expression quantiﬁcation
using RNA-Seq or tiling arrays are becoming routine.
However, existing prokaryotic gene finders are either ab initio
gene finders that identify only coding regions (Delcher et al.,
2007, Hyatt et al., 2010) or purely RNA-Seq—based gene ﬁnders
predicting transcripts (Martin et al., 2010) and are much less
effective than their ab initio competitors for Coding DNA
Sequence (CDS) prediction (Zickmann et al., 2014).
Reconciling conﬂicting predictions is a tedious work, which is
incompatible with the growing prokaryotic genome sequencing
rate.

There is a need for new prokaryotic gene finders that would
directly integrate all available information to produce an en-
riched and precise structural annotation identifying CDS but
also (possibly antisense) non-coding genes and transcription
start sites (TSSs), avoiding tedious reconciliation. We have
shown in Sallet et a]. (2013) that this can be accomplished by
ﬁnely adapting conditional random ﬁeld-based integrative eu-
karyotic gene ﬁnding technology (Foissac et al., 2008) to pro-
karyotic speciﬁcities (overlapping genes, operons). The resulting
software, EuGene-P, simultaneously exploits statistical proper-
ties of sequences, existing annotations, similarities to proteins

and oriented RNA-Seq data to produce an enriched annotation
with a better delineation of functional genomic elements, and
therefore improved expression quantification.

2 APPROACH

To facilitate the application of EuGene—P, we designed a fully
automatic pipeline, described in Figure 1, that allows any user to
directly apply EuGene-P starting just from genomic sequences
and oriented sequence-based expression data (RNA-Seq or tiling
array). The resulting Perl-based EuGene-PP(ipeline) has no par-
ameter to tune (by default), accepts a variety of protein and
expression datasets of different types under most usual formats
and feeds EuGene—P with the following:

0 Markov models of coding regions trained on regions with
strong similarities with a reference protein databank.

0 Regions of similarity with different protein databanks.

o A set of CD8 predictions produced by a reliable self training
ab initio gene ﬁnder. We use Prodigal (Hyatt et al., 2010).

o A set of predicted non-coding RNA genes (ncRNA). We
use tRNAscan—SE (Lowe and Eddy, 1997), rfam_scan
(Grifﬁths-Jones, 2005) and RNAmmer (Lagesen et al.,
2007).

o A set of thresholded and rescaled profiles of measured ex-
pression on each strand along the genome (either RNA-Seq
or tiling arrays) showing transcription.

0 A set of potential transcription start sites, defined as points
of sudden increase in expression identiﬁed by the derivative
of a smoothed version of the expression profile (Sallet et al.,
2013).

EuGene—PP can run using just FASTA genomic sequences and
expression data (provided as oriented Single/Pair—end reads in
either FASTQ/FASTA format, mapped reads in Bam/Sam,
Bed or Wig format, or tiling array data in ndf/pair ﬁles).
Protein databanks for similarity detection are configurable and
may include organism-speciﬁc proteomes. EuGene-PP is pro-
vided with a Galaxy conﬁguration Goecks et a]. (2010) to
deploy EuGene-PP through a Web interface.

The probabilistic model used by EuGene-P (Sallet et al., 2013)
integrates all this information and its own Ribosome Binding
Site predictions to segment the genome in possibly overlapping
coding regions, untranslated regions (UTR) and non-coding
genes. The integration of expression data leads to more reliable

represented, the number of reference genes covered on >50% of their length by predicted genes (cover) or with a reciproqual hit covering at least 50% of

both regions (recip.)

Note: Both annotations show comparable quality albeit for a better behavior of the curated annotation of (Nicolas et al., 2012) for reciprocal hits. This is explained by split/
merged genes in Eugene—PP. Also, the curated annotation includes 56 GenBank annotated ncRNA genes, each with a perfect match in the reference set. On three additional

genomes, EuGene—PP recovers a similar fraction of the Rfam set.

transcripts and TSSs prediction. Prediction is performed inde-
pendently on each strand, allowing for the prediction of antisense
genes.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In Sallet et a]. (2013), we showed how EuGene-P performed
when applied to the genome of the symbiont bacteria
Sinorhizobiummeliloti and associated oriented RNA-Seq data.
Besides its 6308 CDS, the produced annotation contains 1876
ncRNA genes. These ncRNA predictions, with a mean length of
107 nt, cover a large fraction of already characterized or

candidate ncRNA genes. Furthermore, by looking for speciﬁc
RpoE2-binding sites upstream of predicted TSSs, the Smeliloti
RpoE2 regulon could be extended by 3-fold, showing the added
value of predicted TSSs.

To complete this application of EuGene-P, we decided to com-
pare the fully automated annotation produced by EuGene-PP
with a recently published curated annotation of the model bac-
teria Bacillus subtilis. This annotation is based on a number of
condition-speciﬁc expression measures based on tiling arrays
(Nicolas et al., 2012). For CDS, the two annotations were
highly consistent, with >97% of shared CDSs (same STOP).
This is consistent with the reliability of Prodigal ab initio CDS

prediction. We therefore focused our evaluation on ncRNA tran-
script prediction. We used rfam_scan to produce a set of 207
reference ncRNA genes. We separately applied EuGene-PP
using a subset of all tiling-arrays and removing all input from
rfam_scan, RNAmmer or tRNAscan-SE. The comparison of the
automated annotation of EuGene-PP with the curated annota-
tion of Nicolas et al. (2012) with reference to this reference gene
set is given in Table 1. On three additional genomes, EuGene-PP
recovers a similar fraction of the reference genes.

These results also show the ﬂexibility of EuGene-PP that ex-
ploits a variety of information sources, under most usual for-
mats, to produce an annotation comparable with a curated
semiautomated structural annotation, especially on ncRNA
genes, which are still difﬁcult to predict.

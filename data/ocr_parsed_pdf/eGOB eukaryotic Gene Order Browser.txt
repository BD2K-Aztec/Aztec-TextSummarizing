ABSTRACT

Summary: A large number of genomes have been sequenced,
allowing a range of comparative studies. Here, we present the
eukaryotic Gene Order Browser with information on the order
of protein and non-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes of 74 different
eukaryotic species. The browser is able to display a gene of interest
together with its genomic context in all species where that gene
is present. Thereby, questions related to the evolution of gene
organization and non-random gene order may be examined. The
browser also provides access to data collected on pairs of adjacent
genes that are evolutionarily conserved.

Availability: eGOB as well as underlying data are freely available at
http://egob.biomedicine.gu.se

Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at
Bioinformatics online.

1 INTRODUCTION

The large number of eukaryotic genome sequences currently
available has made extensive comparative analysis possible. For
instance, studies of the conservation of gene order will help to
understand genome evolution in general and what factors restrict the
shufﬂing of genes. Databases and genome browsers have therefore
emerged to compare genomes and gene order in different species.
Some focus on speciﬁc organelles such as the OGRe (Jameson
et (11., 2003) and Plastid Gene Order Database (Kuhrihara and
Kunisawa, 2004), while others cover a speciﬁc phylogenetic group
like YGOB (Byrne and Wolfe, 2006) and Genomicus (Muffato et al.,
2010). Typically gene comparisons between species are possible.
We here present the eukaryotic Gene Order Browser (eGOB) which
is useful for comparing and displaying genes with respect to
their genomic environment. There are features that distinguishes
eGOB from previously available ‘gene order browsers’. First,
non-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes are considered in addition to
protein coding genes. Secondly, gene orthologs/homologs are
identiﬁed using both OrthoMCL and Pfam. Thirdly, we consider
a wide range of eukaryotic species representing all important
eukaryotic phylogenetic groups; 19 metazoans, the choanoﬂagellate
Monosiga brevicollis, 27 ﬁingal species, 7 viridiplantae, 6 alveolata,
5 heterokonts, 2 amoebozoans, 4 euglenozoans and the three
deep branching organisms Giardia lamblia, Naegleria gruberi and
Trichomonas vaginalis.

2 METHODS

eGOB stores information about the location of protein and ncRNA genes. The
dataset corresponds to 1 122 102 protein genes and 395 149 ncRNA genes.

Protein ortholog and homolog relationships were identiﬁed with
OrthoMCL (Chen et al.. 2007) and Pfam classiﬁcation (Finn et al.. 2010).
respectively (Davila Lopez et al.. 2010). In addition. protein genes were
functionally annotated with respect to gene ontology (GO) and a measure
of functional similarity was calculated using the GS2 method (Ruths et al..
2009).

As most genomes are missing adequate ncRNA annotation. we carried
out such annotation for all of the organisms considered. First. all ncRNA
genes from Rfam 9.1 (Gardner et al.. 2009). including 975 ncRNA
gene families. were used as queries in BLAST searches against genomic
sequences. The resulting hits were scored with the INFERNAL 0.81 software
(Eddy and Durbin. 1994) using the gathering cutoff as threshold (see also
Supplementary Material). The locations of all predicted ncRNAs were ﬁnally
recorded and added to the previously obtained information regarding the
location of protein genes.

3 THE GRAPHICAL VIEW

The eGOB allows a user to display any eukaryotic gene and
its environment in different species. The graphical view (Fig. 1)
shows the reference gene or gene pair in the center with seven
neighboring genes on both sides. Genes are represented by arrows
which denote the relative direction of transcription. Thick and thin
arrows denote protein and ncRNA genes, respectively. Each gene is
color-coded according to its cluster ID and the clustering method
used. Identically colored genes indicate an orthology relationship.
It is possible to toggle between coloring schemes to emphasize
either the clustering based on orthology (OrthoMCL) or the grouping
based on domain architecture (Pfam). The user can navigate through
the maps by scrolling to the left or to the right. The scrolling
may be performed on each individual genome or on all of them
simultaneously.

4 BIOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS

There are different problems that may be addressed by using
eGOB. Two examples are shown here. One of them illustrates a
situation where a user is able to monitor the evolution of a locus
or chromosomal region. In the other example the evolution of pairs
of adjacent genes is studied, with the aim of identifying genes that
could be transcriptionally linked.

Example I: visualizing the genomic context of the ParaHox
cluster genes: the ParaHox genes (Gsx, de and Cdx) code for
homeodomain transcription factors that regulate the patterning of
the anterior—posterior axis of animals (Gellon and McGinnis, 1998).
These three genes are co-localized in the genomes of mammals,

birds, frogs as well as Branchiostoma. It is believed that this
arrangement was the ancestral gene organization. However, in
the teleost ﬁshes rearrangements gave rise to an organization
where the three genes were separated (Mulley et al., 2006). Using
eGOB, the ParaHox genes may be displayed in their genomic
context. As described in detail in Supplementary Material, a gene
may be identiﬁed on the basis of identiﬁer or protein description
information, or by a BLAST search. All orthologs may then be
displayed in the gene order browser window. For instance, using the
Swissprot identiﬁer PDX1_HUMAN as a starting point, orthologs
to the de1 protein are found and gene order information may be
displayed as shown in the Supplementary Figure S1. This ﬁgure
shows that whereas the three ParaHox genes are tightly clustered
in species such as human and mouse, they are separated in all the
ﬁshes available in eGOB, Danio rerio, Takifugu rubripes, Tetraodon
nigroviridis, Gasterosteus aculeatus and Oryzias latipes. Also in
Ciona intestinalis, the three ParaHox genes are separated (Ferrier
and Holland, 2002). The Gst gene seems to be missing in chicken,
but this may be a result of a gap in the current genome assembly
(Prohaska and Stadler,2006).

Example 2: identifying genes that might be transcriptionally
linked: pairs of genes that are divergently transcribed and that have a
relatively short intergenic distance are expected to be related in terms
of transcriptional control. Such pairs have been identiﬁed involving
protein genes (Adachi and Lieber, 2002; Davila Lopez et al., 2010;
Koyanagi et al., 2005; Piontkivska et al., 2009; Trinklein et al.,
2004). Browsing through eGOB, we may also identify pairs of this
nature that include a ncRNA. For instance, the human U12 small
nuclear RNA gene (RNUIZ) is adjacent to the polymerase delta
interacting protein 3 (POLDIP3) (Fig. 1). This gene pair is shown
to be present in 10 other metazoans and these pairs are all associated
with a short intergenic distance. This information indicates that the
RN U1 2 and POLDIP3 genes are transcriptionally linked.

5 IMPLEMENTATION AND AVAILABILITY

MySQL (version 5.0.26) was used to store and manage the data in
eGOB. Scripts for data querying and retrieving were written in PHP.
The web interface was designed using HTML and JavaScript with all
major browsers supported. All information on gene maps and gene
pairs can be downloaded without any restrictions as tab separated
value (TSV) ﬁles. Resulting data at the different steps in the query
process can be exported as TSV ﬁles. Graphical representations of
gene order maps may also be exported as HTML ﬁles as well as in
an XML format.

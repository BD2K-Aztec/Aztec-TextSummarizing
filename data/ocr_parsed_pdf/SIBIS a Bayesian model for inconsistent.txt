genotyping variant call (Robasky et al., 2014). At the protein
level, one approach toward solving this problem is to incorporate
protein, EST and RNA—seq evidence that may support or contra—
dict the exon/intron structure of the annotated gene. Several
metrics have been developed, for example, the annotation edit
distance (AED) (Eilbeck et al., 2009), which measures how con—
gruent each annotation is with its overlapping evidence. The
MisPred method (Nagy and Patthy, 2013; Nagy et al., 2008) is
based on the hypothesis that conflicts in structural or functional
annotations might imply a badly predicted sequence.
Unfortunately, as stated by the authors, although MisPred iden—
tiﬁes many suspicious sequences, it detects only a fraction of the
truly erroneous sequences. We have previously developed an al—
ternative approach that incorporates evolutionary information
and does not require any structural or functional knowledge
(Prosdocimi et al., 2012; Thompson et al., 2011). This approach
was used to evaluate the effect of sequence errors on multiple
sequence alignment accuracy (Thompson et al., 2011), as well as
in evolutionary and functional enrichment analyses (Prosdocimi
et al., 2012). In this method, the evolutionary conservation of a
set of related sequences was measured using Gribskov profiles
(Gribskov et al., 1987), representing observed amino acid fre—
quencies in alignment columns. Nevertheless, there are a
number of shortcomings in estimating scores for amino acids
based only on their observed frequencies, especially when the
number of observed sequences is small. First, unseen amino
acids are assigned scores based on a substitution matrix
(Dayhoff et al., 1978; Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992) that is gen—
erally chosen arbitrarily. Second, an arbitrary threshold must be
defined to distinguish related from unrelated or erroneous
sequences.

Here, we present a new method, called SIBIS (Bayesian
Inconsistency in Sequences), for the detection of sequence incon—
sistencies or errors, which replaces the Gribskov profiles used
previously with a Bayesian model (Altschul et al., 2010) to rep—
resent the evolutionary information in multiple sequence align—
ments and to estimate the relatedness of speciﬁc sequence
segments. The Bayesian approach provides a strong theoretical
foundation for modeling the amino acid frequencies found at a
speciﬁc alignment position, and for calculating scores for includ—
ing new sequences (Altschul et al., 2010; Sjolander et al., 1996;
Ye et al., 2011). SIBIS thus combines a prior distribution of
amino acid probabilities, with observed amino acid frequencies
at homologous positions within the related proteins. In theory,
the prior distribution may be of any form, but here we use a
powerful and elegant formalism, which is to assume that the
amino acid frequencies follow a Dirichlet distribution or a
mixture of a ﬁnite number of Dirichlet distributions (Sjolander
et al., 1996). We then exploit an efﬁcient method for calculating
posterior distributions, which was developed in the context of
‘Bayesian Integral Log—odds’ (BILD) substitution scores
(Altschul et al., 2010), designed to extend the log—odds formalism
that is widely used to deﬁne residue substitution scores for pair—
wise alignments, to multiple alignments.

Similar Bayesian approaches have been used previously to
improve the accuracy and sensitivity of various sequence analysis
tools, including sequence database searches (Sjolander et al.,
1996) and in Gibbs sampling optimization procedures for local
multiple alignment (Altschul et al., 2010). Here, we use the

Bayesian model to estimate the relatedness of individual se—
quences within a conserved alignment region. To do this, we
compare the probabilities of observing speciﬁc sequences,
under the assumptions of relatedness and unrelatedness.
Unrelated sequence segments are then ﬂagged as sequence incon—
sistencies or potential errors. The accuracy of our prediction is
evaluated and compared with two existing methods, based on a
set of eukaryotic sequences with known sequence errors that
were validated experimentally (Zhang et al., 2012). The results
indicate that the Bayesian approach is statistically most powerful
and has the highest accuracy for detecting inconsistent sequence
segments, corresponding to ambiguous sequence variants or
errors.

2 METHODS

2.1 Protein sequence test sets

To test the performance of the sequence error detection methods, we used
a reference set of protein sequences with known errors that were validated
experimentally (Zhang et al., 2012). The protein sequences resulted from
an automatic genome annotation of the draft genome sequence and as-
sembly of the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) (Gibbs et al., 2007). The
genome was sequenced with about a 5.2-fold coverage, and protein-
coding genes were identiﬁed by comparison with human gene sequences.
In a subsequent study (Zhang et al., 2012), a number of rhesus macaque
genes, including the ﬁrst 100 genes of rhesus chromosome 20, were com-
pared with the orthologous human genes to identify likely sequence
errors. A number of the predicted errors were then validated by targeted
re-sequencing. We excluded 10 gene sequences from the reference set that
were not available in the sequence databases. Thus, the ﬁnal reference set
consisted of 90 protein sequences, of which 37 sequences had identiﬁed
errors and 53 sequences were assumed to be correct. The sequence errors
included examples of badly predicted N/C-terminal positions (43%), in-
sertions/deletions (11%) and suspicious sequence segments (46%).

In addition, we constructed two independent test sets of protein se-
quences from the Uniprot database (Uniprot_Consortium, 2014). The
ﬁrst test set was constructed by randomly selecting 90 sequences from
human chromosome 7, for which the protein names did not contain the
words ‘putative’ or ‘uncharacterized’, and evidence for the protein’s ex-
istence was available at the protein or transcript level. The sequences in
this set were thus considered to be ‘reliable’. The second test set consisted
of 90 ‘unreliable’ sequences selected using the following criteria: protein
existence is ‘predicted’ (from the Uniprot sequence annotation), sequence
status is ‘complete’ (i.e. the sequence is not known to be a fragment in
Uniprot) and protein name contains ‘putative uncharacterized’.

The complete list of protein sequences used in our experiments is avail-
able at http://www.lbgi.fr/~julie/SIBIS.

2.2 Construction of multiple alignments

For each protein sequence in the reference and test sequence sets, we
searched for homologous sequences in the Uniprot database using
BlastP (Altschul et al., 1997). A multiple alignment of the top hits in
the BlastP search (expect value <10, maximum 250 sequences) was con-
structed with the DbClustal program (Thompson et al., 2000). DbClustal
combines the advantages of both local and global alignment algorithms
into a single system, and is thus able to provide accurate global align-
ments of the full-length protein sequences. For comparison purposes, we
also constructed multiple alignments of the top hits found by BlastP
searches in the Uniref90 and Uniref50 databases.

We identiﬁed potentially conserved regions in the multiple alignment
using a strategy similar to that incorporated in RASCAL (Thompson
et al., 2003). Brieﬂy, the sequences in the complete alignment were ﬁrst

divided into more related subfamilies based on an automatically com-
puted dissimilarity threshold implemented in the Secator program
(Wicker et al., 2001), and conserved ‘core blocks’ were identiﬁed for
each subfamily. The core blocks, representing the sequence segments
that are conserved in the majority of the sequences within the subfamily,
were determined using the mean distance (MD) column scores imple-
mented in the NorMD objective function (Thompson et al., 2001). A
sliding window analysis of the MD scores was performed and a threshold
was deﬁned above which columns were considered to be conserved
(Thompson et al., 2003).

These multiple alignments and the deﬁned core blocks are used as
input for the detection of inconsistent sequence segments, using either
the Bayesian approach described below or an existing proﬁle-based
method (Prosdocimi et al., 2012; Thompson et al., 2011).

2.3 Prediction of inconsistent sequence segments

Given a conserved core block within a multiple alignment, we wanted to
estimate the relatedness of a given sequence segment to the core block to
predict unrelated or erroneous sequences. To do this, we used the
Bayesian approach described by Altschul et a]. (2010) for the calculation
of BILD scores for each column in the core block. These scores are
designed to extend log-odds scores for amino acids, such as those used
in pairwise substitution matrices [Dayhoff PAM (Dayhoff et al., 1978),
Blosum (Dayhoff et al., 1978) etc.], to multiple alignment columns. Here,
we describe how we use this approach to calculate posterior probability
distributions for amino acids in each column of the conserved core
blocks, given a prior probability distribution and the observed frequen-
cies of the amino acids in the alignment columns. The posterior prob-
abilities are then used to identify sequence segments that are unrelated to
the other sequences within the core block.

2.4 Dirichlet prior probability distributions

The prior probability distributions of the amino acids can be deﬁned by
Dirichlet distributions or Dirichlet mixtures. Given an amino acid alpha-
bet of length L, a Dirichlet distribution has parameters a, to 01L, where
Olj > 

Because different regions of a protein sequence can have different evo-
lutionary pressures, we use a Dirichlet mixture to deﬁne different prior
probabilities for different collections of amino acids. A Dirichlet mixture
is a set of standard Dirichlet distributions with parameters a“ to 01¢, for

Table 1. Simpliﬁed example of Bayesian inference of posterior distribu-
tions after observation of an alignment column containing residues (I,L)

the ith component Dirichlet distribution. Each component distribution
has a coefﬁcient m, where the m sum to 1.

To our knowledge, the only Dirichlet mixture prior parameters for
protein sequence alignments have been derived by the team who ﬁrst
proposed such mixtures (Sjolander et al., 1996), and these have been
made available at compbio.soe.ucsc.edu/dirichlets/index.html. In the ex-
periments described in the Section 3, we used a 20 component Dirichlet
mixture (recode3.20comp) to deﬁne the prior probability distribution 80
associated with a column of related amino acids. This mixture was
derived from analyses of large numbers of alignments of related protein
sequences, and has a relative entropy of 0.61, roughly equivalent to that
of the PAM-175 matrix. In our experiments, this mixture achieved the
highest sensitivity compared with the other distributions available (data
not shown). General pointers for the choice of a suitable Dirichlet mix-
ture prior have been discussed previously in Altschul et a]. (2010) and at
compbio.soe.ucsc.edu/dirichlets.

2.5 Bayes’ theorem to derive posterior distributions

Posterior distributions can be obtained by modifying the prior probability
distribution after observation of the amino acids in a given alignment
column. To do this, we use the method of Altschul et a]. (2010), which is
reproduced here for the sake of completeness. For an alignment of M
sequences, denote a column of residues: x1 to xM. Then we may apply
Bayes’ theorem to transform the prior distribution 80 to a posterior G) 1,
after the observation of xi. The posterior distribution 81 is also a
Dirichlet distribution 01’, where a; = (xx + 1, but with all other parameters
unchanged. More generally, each subsequent observation xk can be seen
to transform the prior 8H into a posterior distribution 8k. A simpliﬁed
example of the derivation of posterior distributions for an alphabet of
three characters (D,I,L) is shown in Table 1, for an alignment column of
two residues (LL) and in Table 2, for an alignment column of (D,D).

Given the observation of residue x, and a Dirichlet mixture prior of C
components, the parameters m’i and oz’ij of the posterior distributions of
amino acid probabilities may be calculated efﬁciently as follows:

oz’ij = aij otherwise.

For small numbers of sequences, the probability distributions resemble
the Dirichlet mixture prior, while for large numbers of sequences, the
probability distributions converge toward the observed frequencies.

2.6 Estimation of related sequence segments

The posterior distributions 8M after observing the alignment column x,
to xM can be used to calculate the probability of observing a new residue
xM+ 1, under the assumption of relatedness:
c a, ‘
Pr0b(X|®) = 2 m,» +
i=1

21:1 “’7

As an example, the probability of observing a residue I, given an
alignment column of two residues (I,L) as shown in Table 1, is
Prob(I) = 0.11><1.1/3.8 + 0.89 X 2.7/5.7 = 0.45.

As the sequence segments are only evaluated in the conserved core
block regions, gaps are not expected to occur often. Therefore, we
assign the probability of observing a gap an arbitrarily low value of 1072.

The score for a segment of length N aligning to the model (under the
simplifying assumption that each position in the protein is generated in-
dependently) is equal to the product of the probabilities of aligning each
residue to the corresponding column in the model:

N
SegmentScore = H Pr0b(XM + 1 |®M)
k = 1

Thus, in the example shown in Table 1 and 2 of an alignment consist-
ing of two columns (LL) and (D,D), the score for aligning a related
sequence ‘ID’ = 0.45 X 0.92 = 0.41, and the score for aligning an unre-
lated sequence ‘DL’ = 0.06 X 0.05 = 0.003.

To estimate the probability of observing a sequence segment under the
assumption of unrelatedness, we calculate the score of a random sequence
equal to the length of the core block with background amino acid
frequencies equal to 1 / L. Although this clearly does not reﬂect natural
amino acid abundances, the use of more realistic frequencies would
require a more time-consuming simulation of a large set of random
sequences. Finally, sequence segments with a score less than that obtained
by the random sequence are ﬂagged as inconsistent sequences. It should
be noted that the use of equal background frequencies results in a higher
probability for the random sequence and will lead to some ‘inconsistent’
segments being rejected.

2.7 Prediction of N/C-terminal sequence errors

The Bayesian approach described above can be used to estimate the re-
latedness of sequence segments to a conserved region of the alignment. To
detect badly predicted insertions and deletions, alternative methods are
used:

0 Badly predicted start or stop sites are identiﬁed by considering the
positions of the N/C-terminal residues for each sequence in the sub-
family alignment. For each sequence, the position of the terminal
residue in the alignment is noted. A window, W, of ‘normal’ values is
then determined as follows: Q1710 <W< Q3 + 10, where Q1 and Q3
are the lower and upper quartiles, respectively, of the distribution of

terminal positions. Sequences with terminal positions outside this
window are annotated as potential deletion/extension errors.

Inserted sequence segments are detected when a segment of at least
10 unaligned residues belonging to a particular sequence are ﬂanked
by alignment blocks including all the sequences in the subfamily.
More formally, a potential inserted segment is detected if two sub-
family alignment columns (i.j) exist such that [(ni = N) AND
(nj = N) AND (Nk = 1 for i<k<j) AND (jii> = 10)], where N
is the total number of sequences in the subfamily (excluding frag-
ments at column i), ni is the number of residues in column i.

Similarly, missing sequence segments are detected using the following
rule: a potential missing exon is detected if two subfamily alignment
columns (i.j) exist such that [(ni = N) AND (nj = N) AND
(Nk = N71 for i<k< j) AND (jii>=10)], where N is the total
number of sequences in the subfamily (excluding fragments at
column i), ni is the number of residues in column i.

The heuristics described in this section are applied in both the
Bayesian-based method and the proﬁle-based method (Prosdocimi
et al., 2012; Thompson et al., 2011) used for comparison purposes.

2.8 Output of the algorithm

Sequence segments estimated to be unrelated or erroneous are stored as
features in an XML output ﬁle (Thompson et al., 2006) that provides an
appropriate format for use in automatic sequence analysis pipelines, thus
facilitating integration in high-throughput projects. Files are also gener-
ated for input to the JalView program (Waterhouse et al., 2009) for
editing and viewing sequence alignment annotations.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Algorithm overview

To detect badly predicted protein sequences, we developed a new
method that combines a general framework for the analysis of
evolutionary conservation information from multiple sequence
alignments (Thompson et al., 2011) with theoretically robust
Bayesian—based scores for the estimation of the relatedness of
individual sequences (Altschul et al., 2010). The method, called
SIBIS, is outlined in Figure 1.

A multiple alignment of the protein sequences to be evaluated
is needed as input. The sequences in the alignment are then clus—
tered automatically into more closely related subfamilies and
conserved ‘core blocks’ are defined. Within these core blocks,
the aligned sequence segments are scored based on the probabil—
ities of observing the letters in each alignment column under the
assumption that the sequences are related, and under the as—
sumption that they are unrelated (see Section 2 for details).
The sequence segments estimated to be unrelated, or erroneous,
are output in an XML format ﬁle, allowing automatic parsing of
the results for use in automatic sequence analysis pipelines.

3.2 Evaluation and comparison with existing methods

We applied our method to a set of protein sequences predicted
from the rhesus macaque (M .mulatta) genome. A previous study
had identiﬁed errors in the ﬁrst 100 genes of rhesus chromosome
20 and a number of the errors were then validated by targeted re—
sequencing (Zhang et al., 2012). We extracted a reference set of
90 protein sequences from this study, of which 37 sequences had
erroneous segments and 53 sequences were assumed to be

pseudogenization etc.), which affects a single sequence in the
multiple alignment, could be interpreted as an error.
Nevertheless, the majority of the inconsistencies detected by
SIBIS are likely to result from genome sequencing errors or
inaccuracies in the gene annotation pipeline.

Our work conﬁrms previous studies (Brent, 2008; Guigo et al.,
2006; Harrow et al., 2009), which estimated that approximately
half of the sequences in the public databases contain errors, and
it is clear that simply eliminating these sequences from
subsequent analyses is not a viable solution. Our method has
the advantage that the errors are delimited, so that the reliable
sequence segments can be used in subsequent studies. Error
detection methods, such as the one described here, that are
capable of accurately distinguishing between reliable and
unreliable sequence segments will be crucial for automatic
sequence analysis pipelines and should lead to more robust
structural, functional and phylogenetic analyses.

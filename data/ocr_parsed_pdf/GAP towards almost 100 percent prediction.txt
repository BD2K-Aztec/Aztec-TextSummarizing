GAP: Generalized Aggregation Proneness

 

2.4 Energy potentials

The residue pair propensities to occur at adjacent or alternate pair pos-
itions in Amyll39 and Amor168 peptides were treated as partition func-
tions and converted into thermodynamic energy potentials [<p(i,j)] by
using the following equation:

<l>(i,j) 2 —RT 1n Propen(i,j) (3)

where R is the universal gas constant, and T is the thermodynamic tem-
perature. These energy potentials were used to obtain the potential dif-
ference for each residue pair type (i,j) to occur at alternate and adjacent
positions in amyloid and amorphous ﬁ-aggregating hexapeptides using
the following equation:

 = ¢(iaj)Amyloid _ ¢(i’j)Amorphous 

2.5 Distinguishing between amyloid ﬁbril-forming and
amorphous B-aggregating hexapeptides using machine
learning techniques

Several machine learning techniques, including Bayesian function, neural
network, radial basis function network, logistic function, support vector
machine, regression analysis, nearest neighbor, meta learning and deci-
sion tree and rules, implemented in WEKA (Witten and Frank, 2005)
were tested for distinguishing between amyloid and amorphous ﬁ-aggre-
gating hexapeptides. The details of all these methods are available in our
earlier article (Gromiha and Suwa, 2006). We have used the energy po-
tentials obtained from the difference between Amyll39 and Amor168
hexapeptides for the nine residue pairs as input features for these
methods.

2.6 Assessment of predictive ability

We have performed 20-, 10- and 5-fold cross-validation tests for assessing
the predictive ability of each machine learning technique used in the
present work. In this procedure, the available dataset (139 amyloid and
168 amorphous ﬁ-aggregating hexapeptides) is divided into n groups, and
n — 1 of them are used for training a machine learning method. The rest is
used for testing the method. The same procedure is repeated n times so
that each datum is used at least once in the test.

We have used different measures, namely, sensitivity, speciﬁcity, ac-
curacy and precision to assess the performance of machine learning meth-
ods toward distinguishing between Amyll39 and Amor168 peptides.
Sensitivity shows the correct prediction of amyloid peptides, speciﬁcity
is the correct prediction of amorphous ﬁ-aggregating peptides and accur-
acy indicates the overall assessment. These terms are deﬁned as follows
(Gromiha, 2010):

Sensitivity = TP/(TP + FN) (5)
Speciﬁcity = TN/(TN + FP) (6)
Accuracy 2 (TP + TN)/(TP + TN + FP + FN) (7)
Precision = TP/(TP + FP) (8)

where TP is amyloid peptides correctly predicted as amyloid peptides, FP
is amorphous ﬁ-aggregating peptides incorrectly predicted as amyloid
ﬁbril-forming peptides, TN is amorphous ﬁ-aggregating peptides cor-
rectly predicted as amorphous ﬁ-aggregating peptides and FN is amyloid
peptides incorrectly predicted as amorphous ﬁ-aggregating peptides.
These also refer to the number of true positives, false positives, true
negatives and false negatives, respectively. In addition, we have used
the ROC (receiver-operating characteristic) curve to assess the perform-
ance of each machine learning technique used in this work. An ROC
curve is a plot connecting the true-positive rate (sensitivity) and false-

positive rate (1-speciﬁcity). It can be interpreted numerically using a par-
ameter called AUC (area under the curve). There are several programs
available in the literature that can perform ROC analyses and compute
AUC (Sonego et al., 2008).

2.7 Calculation of Z-score
Z-scores were calculated to test the signiﬁcance of GAP scores for the 17
peptides given in Supplementary Table S2 (Roland et al., 2013). For ilh
peptide

Z-score (i) = (GAPscore(i) — u)/a (9)

where p, and a are mean and standard deviations of GAP scores com-
puted for the 17 peptides, respectively.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Alternate and adjacent residue pair compositions in
amyloid ﬁbril and amorphous B-aggregating peptides

We have computed alternate and adjacent residue pair propen—
sities for all the hexapeptides in amyloid ﬁbril (Amyll39) and
amorphous ﬂ—aggregating (Amorl68) datasets and converted
them into statistical potentials (see Section 2). The preferred ad—
jacent and alternate residue pairs in Amyll39 and Amorl68
datasets are shown in Table 1. Some of the preferred residue
pairs at different positions of Amyll39 and Amorl68 hexapep—
tides are common (6. g. SeriThr at positions 172; LeuiVal at 273,
PheiPhe, Valille/Leu at positions 374; Glu/Phe/Valille and Serf
Phe at positions 375), indicating that these pairs may be import—
ant for initial ‘homing in’ of the self—associating ﬂ—strands that
eventually nucleate aggregation. Besides these common residue
pairs, several other preferred residue pairs are different between
Amyll39 and Amorl68. These different residue pairs may be
crucial for deciding the morphological fate of the peptide aggre—
gates and therefore can be used for distinguishing between amyl—
oid ﬁbril and amorphous ﬂ—aggregating peptides. The
comparison of residue pair preferences in ﬂ—strands extracted

from the globular proteins with Amyll39 (or Amorl68) showed
that the distribution of residue pairs to occur at alternate and
adjacent position pairs is mostly uniform in the ﬂ—strands from
globular proteins, whereas the hexapeptides in both Amyll39
and Amorl68 datasets show distinct positionipair—speciﬁc pref—
erences. Furthermore, the residue pair preferences are different
between the ﬂ—strands in the globular proteins and the hexapep—
tide datasets and are used to parameterize GAP. For example,
the hydrophobic residue pairs, AlaiAla, AlaiLeu, AlaiGly,
LeuiAla, LeuiLeu, Glinly, GlyiLeu and ValiAla, are highly
preferred at the alternate faces of ﬂ—strands in globular proteins.
These residue pairs are favored neither in the peptides contained
in Amyll39 nor in Amorl68 datasets. Conversely, the residue
pairs that are preferred in Amyll39 or Amorl68 are not favored
in the ﬂ—strands from globular proteins. Further, we analyzed the
preference of residue pairs in amyloids and disordered regions
(Supplementary Table S4). We noticed that the residue pairs are
dominated with charged and polar residues in disordered re—
gions. In addition, Ala preferred to pair with other residues in
all alternate and adjacent positions. The distinct preferences of
residue pairs in disordered regions and amyloids could distin—
guish both peptides with an accuracy of 99%. Overall, these
observations indicate that amino acid residue side chains play
important roles in determining not only whether a solvent—
exposed ﬂ—strand would aggregate but also the morphological
fate of the aggregate.

3.2 Energy potentials derived from amino acid pair
propensities

To distinguish between amyloid and amorphous ﬂ—aggregating
hexapeptides, the energy potentials (AE) for all amino acid resi—
due pairs (20 x 20 matrices) to occur at nine different pair pos—
itions (adjacent and alternate) in Amyll39 and Amorl68 were
computed using Equation (3) described in Section 2. The energy
potential differences (AAE) for residue pairs to occur at a given
position pair in amyloid and amorphous ﬂ—aggregating hexapep—
tides were also computed [Equation (4) in Section 2]. The pre—
ferred residue pairs (Supplementary Table S4) in Amyll39 are
dominated by the combinations of both aliphatic/aromatic or
aliphatic and aromatic residues. This is less prevalent in case of
the Amorl68 peptides (Supplementary Table S5). In both
Amyll39 and Amorl68, the numbers of preferred polaripolar,
polarwharged and chargedwharged residue pairs are small: one
(SeriThr at position pairs 172) in Amyll39 and none in
Amorl68. These results are consistent with our earlier observa—
tions on distinct position—speciﬁc preferences between amyloid
and amorphous ﬂ—aggregating hexapeptides (Thangakani et al.,
2013).

The difference in energy values for all the residue pairs plays a
key role in distinguishing between amyloid and amorphous
ﬂ—aggregating peptides, and these may be reﬂected in aggregation
kinetic differences between the two types of hexapeptides.
Moreover, aggregation may be triggered with the combination
of two adjacent and/or alternate residue pairs, which is reﬂected
in the energy difference AAE. Therefore, the use of AAE values
for residue pairs at different positions could successfully distin—
guish between Amyll39 and Amorl68 hexapeptides.

3.3 Machine learning can distinguish between amyloid and
amorphous B-aggregating hexapeptides

We have used several machine learning techniques for distin—
guishing between Amyll39 and Amorl68 hexapeptides, and
the results are presented in Table 2. The parameters used in
each machine learning technique are given in Supplementary
Table S6. We have considered nine features based on the residue
pairs and their locations in all the considered hexapeptides as
input for training and cross—validation.

The performance was measured in terms of accuracy, sensitiv—
ity and speciﬁcity of the predictions (see Section 2). The Bayesian
network—based method performed the best. It yielded a 10—fold
cross—validation accuracy of 96% along with the highest sensi—
tivity (135 peptides, 97.1%) obtained by using statistically
derived position—speciﬁc residue pair energy potentials. We
have also evaluated the performance using residue pair compos—
ition and speciﬁc pair position propensities. We observed similar
results, and the energy—based potentials showed 2% higher ac—
curacy than the other features. To further test the accuracy of
GAP, additional datasets of amyloid fibril—forming datasets were
used. In particular, a new dataset of 40 amyloid fibril—forming
peptides (Hex40) was added to the cross—validation.
Supplementary Table S7 shows the performance of GAP on
these peptides with several measures of assessment. Our
method could distinguish between amyloid ﬁbril and amorphous
ﬂ—aggregating hexapeptides with a 10—fold cross—validation accur—
acy of 93.7%. The sensitivity and speciﬁcity are 95.5 and 91.7%,
respectively. GAP also correctly predicted 14 of the 15 hexapep—
tides in the Amleryst15 dataset. Unfortunately, similar data on
peptides that form amorphous ﬂ—aggregates are not available in
the literature. Therefore, further testing of GAP is limited to
amyloid ﬁbril—forming peptides only.

3.4 Assessment using peptides of different lengths

GAP was tested on 310 amyloid ﬁbril—forming peptides of dif—
ferent lengths (Amyl310). The following strategy was used to
predict whether a query peptide is amyloid firbil forming: The
peptide sequence is divided into six—residue—long windows that
slide by one residue at a time. For each window, the scores for
amyloid ﬁbril formation and amorphous ﬂ—aggregation are

3.6 Benchmarking the performance of GAP

Simultaneous parameterization for the formation of amorphous
ﬂ—aggregates and amyloid ﬁbrils is unique to GAP. As far as we
know, no other method available in the literature can simultan—
eously distinguish between amyloid fibril—forming and amorph—
ous ﬂ—aggregating peptides, except for the one developed earlier
by our group (Thangakani et al., 2013). This limits our ability to
directly compare GAP with the other methods and benchmark
its performance. Notwithstanding this limitation, comparing the
performance of GAP with ﬁve commonly used methods, namely,
PAGE, AGGREGSCAN, TANGO, WALTZ and Amylpred2
(Table 4), proved insightful. Here, correct identiﬁcation of the
peptides in Amyll39 and Amorl68 datasets by different methods
was used as benchmark for evaluating their performances.
PAGE and AGGREGSCAN performed well at correctly iden—
tifying amyloid ﬁbril—forming peptides in Amyll39 (122 and 120
hexapeptides, respectively), but not at correctly identifying pep—
tides in the Amorl68 dataset (l4 and 63, respectively). On the
other hand, TANGO correctly identiﬁed 155 (92.3%) of
amorphous ﬂ—aggregating hexapeptides in Amorl68, but only
31 (22.3%) of the hexapeptides in the Amyll39 dataset. The
above observations can be rationalized on the basis of data
used in parameterization of these programs (Conchillo—Solé
et al., 2007; Fernandez—Escamilla et al., 2004; Tartaglia et al.,
2004). TANGO was developed to predict ﬂ—strand—mediated ag—
gregation, in general, and is not speciﬁc to amyloid ﬁbril morph—
ology (Fernandez—Escamilla et al., 2004; Maurer—Stroh et al.,
2010). The performance of WALTZ was found to be superior
to other methods for both Amyll39 (81.3% correct predictions)
and Amorl68 (77.6% correct predictions). WALTZ uses pos—
ition—specific matrices developed speciﬁcally for amyloid ﬁbril
morphology (see Supplementary Material in Maurer—Stroh
et al., 2010), and several peptides in Amyll39 were also used in

the training set of WALTZ. Therefore, its high performance on
Amyll39 dataset was expected. However, its high performance
for the Amorl68 dataset is surprising and shows that this
method is able to correctly identify amorphous ﬂ—
aggregating hexapeptides also. Our previous method using posi—
tion—speciﬁc residue potentials of hexapeptides performed at par
with WALTZ (Table 4). It correctly predicted 111 (of Amyll39)
and 140 (of Amorl68) hexapeptides as amyloid fibrils and
amorphous ﬂ—aggregating, respectively. The second—generation
consensus—based method, Amylpred2, correctly identiﬁed 138
(99.3%) of the 139 peptides in Amyll39, but only 48.8% (82)
of the peptides in Amorl68. In comparison with the above
programs, GAP was able to correctly identify both amyloid
fibril—forming amorphous ﬂ—aggregating hexapeptides with high
sensitivity (97.1%) and speciﬁcity (95.2%).

To further benchmark the performance of GAP with other
algorithms, the amyloid ﬁbril—forming peptides from three dif—
ferent experimentally validated datasets, Hex40, Amleryst15
and Amyl310 were also used (Table 4). The sequences con—
tained in the above datasets did not form part of the training
datasets for GAP. However, it is unknown to us whether these
sequences were used in parameterization of the other pro—
grams. PAGE correctly identiﬁed all the peptides in Hex40,
Amleryst15 and Amyl310. TANGO and WALTZ correctly
identiﬁed 71.6 and 47.1%, respectively, of the peptides in
Amyl310. In the other two datasets, Hex40 and
AmlerystlS, fewer than three (<10% of the peptides) haxa—
peptides were correctly identiﬁed by TANGO and WALTZ.
Amylpred2 correctly predicted in the range of 59780% in
Hex40, Amleryst15 and Amyl310 datasets (Table 4). Our
earlier method predicted l3 and 7 peptides as amyloid fibrils
in Hex40 and Amleryst15, respectively. In comparison with
the above methods, GAP consistently performed at the accur—
acy levels of 390% (Table 4).

GAP was also tested on 48 experimentally determined amyloid
fibril—forming peptide segments of different lengths from 33
well—known amyloidogenic proteins (Tsolis et al., 2013). It cor—
rectly predicted 47 (98%) of them (Supplementary Table S8).
Further, developers of WALTZ (Maurer—Stroh et al., 2010)

 

1988

ﬁm'spzumofpmjxo'sopeuuopuoiq/ﬁdnq

GAP: Generalized Aggregation Proneness

 

had benchmarked the performance of their method by using 12
Sup35—derived lO—residue—long peptides that were shown form
amyloid ﬁbrils experimentally. The performance of GAP along
with other prediction methods TANGO, WALTZ and
Amylpred2 is shown in Supplementary Table S1. GAP correctly
predicted all the 12 peptides (100% sensitivity). These peptides
were not part of training set for GAP. Previously, the maximum
sensitivity of 67% was attained by WALTZ.

Recently, Roland et a]. (2013) have tested abilities of four ag—
gregation prediction methods, namely, Zyggregator, TANGO,
WALTZ and Zipper using a dataset of 15 scrambled peptide
sequences derived from l8—residue—1ong N—terminal segment of
huntingtin (httNTQ) that forms ot—helix—rich aggregates under
physiological conditions. They report that 5 of the 15 peptides
form ﬂ—rich amyloid fibrils under the nearly physiological condi—
tions described in the report. In addition, two more peptides were
found by the authors to form amyloid fibrils at higher concen—
trations. The Lys6A1a mutant of the parent peptide (httNTQK6A)
was also reported to form amyloid fibrils. Overall, Roland et a].
(2013) studied 17 peptides, and 8 of these form amyloid ﬁbrils,
whereas the remaining 9 do not form any detectable aggregates
under the reported conditions. These peptides were again not
part of training set for GAP. GAP is able to distinguish between
amyloid ﬁbril—forming peptides and non—aggregating peptides,
but not perfectly. Other algorithms had also performed poorly
on this set of peptides [see Table l in Roland et a]. (2013)].
Supplementary Table S2 and Supplementary Figure SF2 show
the results obtained from the predictions made by GAP on this
set of 17 peptides. For each peptide, the GAP score was com—
puted as the average of amyloid fibril—forming probabilities for
all the overlapping hexapeptide segments of the peptide obtained
by sliding a window of six residues, one residue at a time, along
the peptide sequence. The average GAP score for 17 peptides in
the study by Roland et a]. (2013) is 0.735 :l:0.087 (range, 0.5637
0.932). For the eight peptides that form amyloid ﬁbrils, the aver—
age GAP score is higher at 0.772:|:0.084 (range, 0.68H.932).
On the other hand, the average GAP score for the 9 peptides that
do not aggregate is lower (0.702:|:0.08l; range, 056341797)
than the average for all 17 peptides. Supplementary Figure
SF2 plots the Z—scores obtained using Equation (9) in Section
2 for all the 17 peptides. A line at zero Z—score is drawn in this
ﬁgure. It can be seen that five of eight amyloid fibril—forming
peptides fall above the line, that is, their GAP scores are more
than the average GAP score for this set of peptides. Similarly,
ﬁve of nine non—aggregating peptides fall below this line. It
should be noted here that Roland et a]. (2013) performed these
experiments at near—physiological conditions. GAP was trained
on hexapeptides for which the experiments were performed
under non—physiological conditions (Lopez de la Paz and
Serrano, 2004; Maurer—Stroh et al., 2010; Thangakani et al.,
2013). Comparatively low peptide concentrations in the experi—
ments by Roland et a]. (2013) could be another factor.

3.7 Limitations of GAP and future directions

The benchmarking studies described above show that despite
substantial improvements in predictive power of GAP, there
are limitations to GAP. The experimental data used in the par—
ameterization of this program (Lopez de la Paz and Serrano,

2004; Maurer—Stroh et al., 2010) were restricted to measurements
at the single peptide concentrations at acidic and neutral pH.
Hence, although our method is able to discriminate between
amyloid ﬁbril—forming and amorphous ﬂ—aggregating peptides
to high degrees of sensitivity and speciﬁcity, it is not yet able
to predict the effect of concentration and pH on aggregation
behavior of the hexapeptides. The method was developed with
a small dataset of 139 amyloids and 169 amorphous peptides and
shall need further refinements when additional data become
available. Another potential improvements to GAP shall be the
ability to predict for a given hexapeptide region, its propensity to
form a ﬂ—strand, amorphous ﬂ—aggregates and amyloid fibrils in
a step—wise manner. Further, the work on the effect of mutations
on aggregation propensity of peptide and protein sequences is
also in progress.

4 CONCLUSION

The amino acid sequences of amyloid ﬁbril—forming and
amorphous ﬂ—aggregating hexapeptides show distinct residue
pair preferences to occur at adjacent and alternate positions.
This observation enabled us to derive statistical potentials for
amino acid residue pairs to simultaneously occur at the alternate
and adjacent position pairs in hexapeptides that have been ex—
perimentally shown in the literature to from either amyloid ﬁbrils
or amorphous ﬂ—aggregates. These residue pair preferences have
been used to develop a new tool called GAP. GAP is capable of
accurately identifying APRs in protein and peptide sequences
and also distinguishing whether the predicted APRs shall pre—
dominantly form amyloid fibrils or amorphous ﬂ—aggregates.
This work also improved our fundamental understanding of
ﬂ—strand—mediated aggregation process by highlighting the role
of side chains in determining the morphological fate of the
aggregates.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Tiki proteins appear to antagonize Wnt signalling pathway
by acting as Wnt proteases, thereby affecting Wnt solubility by its
amino-terminal cleavage. Tiki1 protease activity was shown to be
metal ion-dependent and was inhibited by chelating agents and thus
was tentatively proposed to be a metalloprotease. Nevertheless, Tiki
proteins exhibit no detectable sequence similarity to previously
described metalloproteases, but instead have been reported as
being homologues of TraB proteins (Pfam ID: PF01963), a widely dis-
tributed family of unknown function and structure. Here, we show that
Tiki proteins are members of a new superfamily of domains contained
not just in TraB proteins, but also in erythromycin esterase (Pfam ID:
PF05139), DUF399 (domain of unknown function 399; Pfam ID:
PF04187) and MARTX toxins that contribute to host invasion and
pathogenesis by bacteria. We establish the core fold of this enzymatic
domain and its catalytic residues.

1 INTRODUCTION

Wnt signalling is a key developmental pathway controlling both
embryonic development and tissue maintenance by regulation of
stem cell proliferation in adults. Aberrant activation of the Wnt
signalling pathway can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation.
Wnt-related diseases are extensive in number and include neuro-
degenerative disease, inﬂammatory bowel disease, cleft lip/palate
disorders and various cancers (Herr et al., 2012). The ﬁrst Wnt
gene was discovered >30 years ago, and despite extensive
research into this signalling pathway, it has remained unclear
how Wnt morphogen levels and activities are regulated. In
large part, this is because of the vast numbers of Wnt isoforms,
receptors, co-receptors and different secreted antagonists
encoded in animal genomes (Bouldin and Kimelman, 2012;
Vincent and Magee, 2012; Willert and Nusse, 2012).

Our understanding of Wnt signalling has recently been
advanced substantially by the characterization of Tiki1, a gene
which when over-expressed in X enopus embryos results in head
enlargement; Tiki refers to large-headed humanoid carvings in
Polynesian cultures. Tiki1, and its paralogue Tiki2, antagonize
Wnt activity upstream of its receptors (Zhang et al., 2012).

2 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

2.1 Computational protein sequence analysis. The TIKI
domain.

Initially, we performed a sequence similarity search using the
human Tiki1 protein as query using BLAST (Altschul et al.,
1997). A multiple sequence alignment of Tiki homologous
sequences was generated with T-Coffee (Notredame et al.,
2000) and used as input to make a proﬁle using HMMER2
(Eddy, 1996). Iterative proﬁle versus sequence searches against
the UniRef50 protein sequence database (Wu et al., 2006) iden-
tiﬁed a conserved region that more clearly deﬁnes the family of
Tiki homologous proteins (corresponding to amino acids 527331
of human Tiki1). The resulting Tiki alignment is extended rela-
tive to the TraB Pfam family (PF01963) (Punta et al., 2012),
which subsequently provided greater power to identify remote
homologies.

We then compared sequence conservation proﬁles from differ-
ent protein families using HHpred (Soding et al., 2005) against
Pfam (Punta et al., 2012) and pdb70 proﬁle databases (Soding
et al., 2005). Our ﬁrst ﬁnding was that the conserved region
in the Tiki/TraB family is similar in sequence to domain of
unknown function 399 (DUF399) proteins (Bateman et al.,
2010; Chan et al., 2006) and to a family of erythromycin esterases
(Morar et al., 2012) (Fig. l) (E-Value: 1.7 x 10—3; Supplementary
Fig. S1). Both families have structurally characterized members:
for the DUF399 family, ChaN [protein data bank (PDB)]:
2G5G) (Chan et al., 2006) was identiﬁed as a heme interacting
protein, although no enzymatic function for this protein was
suggested. The erythromycin esterase family has two structurally
characterized members: BcR136 (PDB: 2QGM) and Bch35
(PDB: 2RAD & 3B55) (Northeast Structural Genomics
Consortium, unpublished). A detailed functional characteriza-
tion, including active site identiﬁcation and structural interpret-
ation, was recently published for the erythromycin esterase EreB
protein (Morar et al., 2012). The structural similarity between
DUF399 and erythromycin esterase families has already been
described by Morar et a]. (2012) (Supplementary Fig. S2).

Unexpectedly, in the subsequent profile-versus-proﬁle
comparison analysis, we then also found sequence similarity to
close homologues of the Pasteurella multocida Toxin (PMT, also
known as the Dermonecrotic Toxin) (E-Value: 6.9 x 10—2;
Supplementary Fig. S1); this sequence similarity was restricted
to the C2—2 domain whose tertiary structure is known in PMT
(Kitadokoro et al., 2007). The C2—2 domain-containing family
is made up of multidomain protein toxins such as PMT and
MARTX proteins from Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio vulm'ﬁcus and

Fig. 1. Multiple sequence alignment of representative TIKI domain-containing families. Multiple sequence alignments for each family (Tiki/TraB,
erythromycin esterase, DUF399 and Dermonecrotic toxins/MARTX) were generated with the program T-Coffee (Notredame et al., 2000) using default
parameters, slightly reﬁned manually and visualized with the Belvu program (Sonnhammer and Hollich, 2005). The ﬁnal superfamily alignment was
generated using a combination of proﬁle-to-proﬁle comparisons (Séding et al., 2005) and sequence alignments derived from structural superpositions for
those families whose structure is known (Holm and Sander, 1995). Active site residues are labelled and coloured according to reference protein sequences:
Tiki1, ChaN (DUF399 family), erythromycin esterase family member BcR136 (PDB: 2QGM, Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium, unpublished)
and V.vulm'ficus MARTX in blue, grey, red and green, respectively. Families of TIKI domain-containing proteins are indicated by coloured bars to the
left of the alignment: TIKI/TraB, DUF399, erythromycin esterase, C2-2 Dermonecrotin Toxin in blue, grey, red and green, respectively. Secondary
structure predictions (Jones, 1999) were performed for the TIKI/TraB family (show in ss_pred lane), these are consistent with X-ray determined
secondary structures of the DUF399 family member ChaN (PDB: 2G5G) (Chan et al., 2006), erythromycin esterase BcR136 (PDB: 2QGM)
(Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium, unpublished) and P.multocida C2-2 domain (PDB: 2EBF chain X) (Kitadokoro et al., 2007). Alpha-
helices and beta-strands are indicated by cylinders and arrows, respectively. The amino acid colouring scheme indicates average BLOSUM62 scores
(which are correlated with amino acid conservation) for each alignment column: red (greater than 2), violet (between 2 and 0.8) and light yellow (between
0.8 and 0.2). The boundaries of the two most conserved regions in the TIKI domain are indicated by the residue positions on each side. The numbering

Tiki, at the head of a new superfamily of enzymes

 

Aeromonas hydrophila (Jeong and Satchell, 2012; Kwak et al.,
2011; Lee et al., 2007, 2008, 2013; Lo et al., 2011; Suarez et al.,
2012), as well as bacterial effector proteins from Pseudomonas
syringae and Erwim'a amylovora (Mansﬁeld et al., 2012).
MARTX toxins, the most experimentally studied group of this
family, are large proteins characterized by the presence of RtxA
repeats (Pfam ID: PF07634) at the N and C termini, essential for
translocation of the central portion of the toxin across the
eukaryotic plasma membrane. After autoproteolysis of the holo-
toxin, at the host cell cytosol, the effector domains located in the
central region of the toxin are released, which possess critical
functions in toxinosis, and promote colonization and evasion
of host immune system (Geissler et al., 2010; Roig et al., 2011;
Satchell, 2011). The C2—2 domain is one such effector domain
whose function in pathogenesis has remained unknown.

The unexpected ﬁnding of sequence similarity between
erythromycin esterases and close homologues of PMT, prompted
us to compare their known protein tertiary structures, which
subsequently were revealed as being similar (PDB codes
2QGM and 2EBF; DALI Z-score=7, root-mean-
square-deviation of superimposed alpha-carbon atoms=3.6A
over 126 aligned residues with 13% identity; Supplementary
Figs. S1 and S2) (Holm and Sander, 1995). The shared core
domain contains four beta-strands and ﬁve alpha-helices, pre-
cisely where the catalytic residues described in the esterase struc-
ture are located (Supplementary Fig. S2) (Morar et al., 2012).

Three reasons likely explain why these remote homologous
relationships between C2-2 domains of bacterial toxins, erythro-
mycin esterase/DUF399 and Tiki/TraB families had hitherto
escaped detection: (i) the insertion of a non-conserved helical
region that interrupts this domain (Fig. 1 and Supplementary
Fig. S3); (ii) the low degrees of sequence identity among the
different members of the superfamily; and (iii) the absence of
the putative catalytic residues in the C2—2 domain of the struc-
turally characterized PMT (see TOXA_2EBF sequence in
Fig. 1), which are otherwise conserved in many members of
this family of bacterial toxins (see representative members
shown in green in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S3).

Reciprocal proﬁle versus proﬁle similarity searches produced
convergent results, which is strongly indicative of homology
(Supplementary Fig. S1). No further homologues were identiﬁed
in subsequent sequence similarity searches. Additionally, a sec-
ondary structure prediction was performed for the TIKI/TraB
family (ss_pred lane in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S3) (Jones,
1999), showing good agreement with the known secondary struc-
ture of different members of the superfamily (lanes: 2C5G,
2QGM and 2EBFX in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S3). The
described similarities in sequence and structure provide strong
evidence that TIKI/TraB, erythromycin esterase, DUF399 and

C2—2 domain-containing proteins families form a new superfam-
ily of enzymes. We term the domain common to all of these
proteins ‘TIKI’, as it lies at the head of this large and diverse
superfamily.

2.2 Reaction mechanism and active site conservation

TIKI superfamily proteins appear to catalyze different hydrolytic
(esterase or protease) reactions and are characterized by a
number of conserved amino acids (Fig. 1 and Supplementary
Fig. S3) that form part of the recently described erythromycin
esterase active site (Morar et al., 2012). Morar et al. showed that
the Escherichia coli erythromycin esterase EreB activity is highly
dependent on two amino acids (H46 and E74 in EreB; H84 and
E112 in Bcr136), which correspond to human Tiki1 (H60 and
E87). It is notable that these two amino acids, together with
structurally adjacent basic residues (R304 and H332 in Tiki1),
are highly conserved across TIKI domain proteins (Fig. 1 and
Supplementary Fig. S3). Consequently, we propose that enzyma-
tically active TIKI domain proteins adopt the catalytic mechan-
ism of the erythromycin esterase family wherein a conserved Hisi
Glu pair activates a water molecule, which acts as a nucleophile
to hydrolyse a carbonyl group, which is common to both ester
and peptide bonds (Morar et al., 2012).

The proposed metal ion-dependence described for Tiki1
(Zhang et al., 2012) and EreA (erythromycin esterase family)
may not be extended to all TIKI superfamily members because
the reaction mechanism is metal ion-independent and resistant
to chelating agents in EreB and Bcr136 members of the erythro-
mycin esterase family (Morar et al., 2012).

3 CONCLUSION

Our analyses demonstrate that human TIKI proteins lie at the
head of a widely phyletically distributed protein superfamily that
includes not only the TraB family but also erythromycin esterase,
DUF399 and MARTX families. Furthermore, our identiﬁcation
of likely active site residues in TIKI and MARTX proteins
should assist experiments that investigate the function of these
critical proteins in different human pathologies and encourage
the development of drugs that target the identiﬁed TIKI super-
family conserved active centre of enzymes, with key roles in
antibiotic resistance (erythromycin esterase family), bacterial
toxinosis (MARTX and Dermonecrotic toxin families) and the
Wnt signalling pathway (TIKI family). During completion of
this work, Bazan et a]. (2013) reported similar results that
focused on the description of the TIKI/TraB subfamily. Our
work complements these results by presenting a more extensive
description and annotation of sequence conservation in the pre-
dicted active site across TIKI subfamilies.

(Chan et al., 2006) and erythromycin esterase BcR136 (PDB: 2QGM) (Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium, unpublished) structures. Models and

structures are presented using Pymol (http://www.pymol.org)

ABSTRACT

Summary: The systematic and unbiased charting of protein—protein
interaction (PPI) networks relevant to health or diseases has become
an important and burgeoning challenge in systems biology. Further, cur-
rent reports have supported that good correlation exists between the
topological properties and biological function of protein nodes in net-
works. Coronary artery disease (CAD, also called coronary heart disease)
is the most common type of heart disease worldwide. Traditional
approaches of studying individual gene or protein have shown their
weakness in such complex disease. Here, we provide NetCAD, a
web-based tool for systematic investigation of CAD-specific proteins in
human PPI network. The features of NetCAD includes the following: pro-
posing a novel method combining biological principles and graph theory,
quantified topological analysis tools, build-in PPI information database
consolidated from major public databases, creating CAD-associated
subnetwork and visualizing network graph with good visual effects.
NetCAD may provide important biological information for uncovering
the molecular mechanisms and potential targets for therapies of CAD,
which could not be found merely through molecular biology methods.

1 INTRODUCTION

Proteiniprotein interaction (PPI) is an important layer of con-
nectivity between cell processes. The disturbance of PPIs may
result in the disturbance of the cell process to which they con-
tribute, compromising the cell Viability or even leading to cell
death. With the development of high-throughput screens, such
as yeast two-hybrid assays, affinity puriﬁcation coupled to mass
spectrometry and synthetic-lethal and synexpression, great
volume of PPI data has been yielded, forming complex PPI net-
works (PPINs) of varied species. These large networks provide a
global View of cellular function and biological processes, which
might bring biological and computational researchers new
opportunities and challenges.

Recently, many studies indicated that the topology of PPINs
is intimately related to biological functions and has potential
applications, such as predicting disease-causing genes (Ideker
and Sharan, 2008), annotating genes and proteins (Jiang et al.,

2011; Liu et al., 2012), elucidating the mechanisms of diseases
Wang et al., 2012) and identifying diseases biomarkers (Liu
et al., 2012; Xiong et al., 2010).

As a leading cause of death and disability in western countries,
coronary artery disease (CAD) has been the focus of the research
for decades, and massive data have been accumulated such as
candidate gene and single nucleotide polymorphism information.
However, the progress is still limited even advanced genetic
approaches are resorted to (Cohen, 2006). Noticing that graphic
theories in PPINs may contribute to the research of complex
diseases such as CAD, we have developed a web-based tool,
NetCAD, for topological analysis and Visualization of
CAD-associated PPINs.

2 DATA SOURCES AND FUNCTIONALITY

For a comprehensive and unbiased study of CAD, NetCAD
integrates 129546 experimental PPI data of 19480 human
proteins from seven major public PPI databases including
BioGRID, DIP, HPRD, IntAct, MINT, BIND and iRerVeb.
By manually curating from literature and extracting the most
reliable ones from the CADgene database (Liu et al., 2011),
265 CAD-related genes were obtained. Then we mapped these
genes into proteins and searched them in the PPI database we
formerly built. Despite four proteins, which could not be found
in the PPI database, 261 CAD-associated proteins were success-
fully mapped. Next, we searched all paths to find all connections
between any two of these proteins directly and indirectly. Finally,
we got a CAD-associated subgraph (subnetwork) of 261 nodes
(CAD-associated proteins) with 2310 edges (326 direct inter-
actions edges and 1984 indirect interactions edges).

NetCAD implements topological analysis tools, which focus
on this CAD-associated subgraph as a partial subgraph of the
largest PPIN with 19480 nodes (proteins) and 129546 edges
(PPIs). Currently, we offer the computation of six network meas-

ures to evaluate the signiﬁcance of specified nodes.
Degree: The degree DV of a node V is the number of edges

adjacent to node V. Results might be biased when only node
degrees were used to measure topology of PPINs, as some pro-
teins are ‘hotspot’ and studied better than others, which lead to
more PPI data correlated to these proteins.

Clustering coeﬂicient: The clustering coefficient of a node
quantiﬁes how close its neighbors tend to cluster together. It is
deﬁned as:

Fig. 1. NetCAD interface and three sample outputs. (A) NetCAD user interface: (i) tool box, (ii) network graph panel (iii) information box. (B)
Subnetwork graph constructed with random selected nodes in NetCAD database, pink round nodes are CAD related, and blue diamond nodes are not
CAD related. (C) A sample shortest path found by NetCAD from ITGB2 to DOK2. (D) Results generated by topological analysis tool in NetCAD are
sorted in descending order according to the value of assortativity of each node

where T, is the number of triangles through node v and D, is the
degree of v.

Assortativity: Assortativity A,, or average neighbor degree of
node v, measures the average degree of the neighborhood of node

v. It is given by:
1
A, = Dk
|er 2

where N,- are the neighbors of node i and Dk is the degree of node
j, which belongs to N,.

Shortest path: The shortest path SP,_I is the minimum sum of
weights path from source node s to target node t (PPIN is un-
weighted graph, which means all the edges are the same weight,
SPV-t here represents the one contains the minimum number of
edges among all the paths from v to t).

Betweenness: Betweenness B, of a node v is the sum of the
fraction of all-pairs shortest paths that pass through:

o,(s, t)
Bv _ Z o(s, t)

ssétgév

 

 

where o(s, t) is total number of shortest paths from node s to node
t and o,(s, t) is the number of those paths that pass through v.

C loseness: The farness F, of a node V is deﬁned as the sum of its
distances to all other nodes, and closeness is the inverse of the
farness. It can be regarded as a measure of how long it takes to
spread information from v to all other nodes sequentially. The
classic closeness of PPIN should be 0, as the whole PPIN of
human is not a connected graph. Thus, in NetCAD, we computed
the closeness for each connected part separately then normalize to:

n — l
size(G) — 1

where n is the number of nodes in the connected part of graph
containing the node.

3 INTERFACE AND EXAMPLE

NetCAD has a friendly interface presented by a JavaScript
framework Ext JS (Fig. 1A). The interactive network graph is

generated by Cytoscape Web (Lopes et al., 2010). Edges and
nodes are in the different shapes and colors according to their
disease-associated attributes. Users can click on nodes or edges
for detailed information, which will be shown in the box at the
bottom of the browser window. Subnetworks can be constructed
from the speciﬁc proteins lists which the users query. Topological
tools will be available once any subnetwork is created. A detail
demonstration of topological analysis can be accessed from the
help tab. Three example outputs are shown in Figure lBiD as
the Visualization of subnetwork, shortest path finding and the
computation of topological attributes, respectively.

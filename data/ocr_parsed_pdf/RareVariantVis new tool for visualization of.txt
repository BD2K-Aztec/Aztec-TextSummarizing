Abstract

Motivation: The search for causative genetic variants in rare diseases of presumed monogenic in—
heritance has been boosted by the implementation of whole exome (WES) and whole genome
(WGS) sequencing. In many cases, WGS seems to be superior to WES, but the analysis and visual—
ization of the vast amounts of data is demanding.

Results: To aid this challenge, we have developed a new tool—RareVariantVis—for analysis of
genome sequence data (including non—coding regions) for both germ line and somatic variants. It
visualizes variants along their respective chromosomes, providing information about exact
chromosomal position, zygosity and frequency, with point—and—click information regarding dbSNP
IDs, gene association and variant inheritance. Rare variants as well as de novo variants can be
flagged in different colors. We show the performance of the RareVariantVis tool in the Genome in a
Bottle WGS data set.

ation of many rare diseases and syndromes with heterogenic or
unknown etiology of presumed monogenic inheritance. This stand—
ardization is driven by the decreasing cost of WGS, more uniform
coverage of the exome in WGS data as compared to Whole exome

analysis of human WGS data is challenging because of the data size
(i.e. 80 GB of compressed raw data and 10—20 GB of variants/anno—
tated data for a 30>< genome), technical errors, alignment issues in
tandem repeat regions or around centromeres (Szalkowski and

Anisimova, 2013), and variant calling problems (Liu et al., 2013;
Tan et al., 2014). Currently, a number of software packages are
available for visualization of WGS data, such as the Integrative
Genome Viewer, Circos and the UCSC browser. Although these
tools can efficiently visualize reads and variants across the genome,
they do not provide easily accessible summary of rare, sample char—
acteristic variants. It is therefore still a need for additional open
source tools that can be applied by non—experts for the handling and
visualization of WGS data in an experimental diagnostics setting,
focusing on discovery of variants that may be causative for rare dis—
orders of presumed monogenic inheritance (Gilissen et al., 2014).

In this work, we present a new bioconductor package,
RareVariantVis, being a simple tool for the filtering and visualiza—
tion of human WGS data. RareVariantVis provides genome scale in—
formation that may replace microarray—based homozygosity
mapping and exome sequencing. We demonstrate the performance
of the tool in WGS data from the Genome in a Bottle Ashkenazim
Trio sample (Complete Genomics data).

2 Materials and methods

The Ashkenazim Trio WGS samples (Zook et al., 2014), sequenced
with the Complete Genomics technology, was used in design of the
RareVariantVis tool. This data set is publically available through
the Personal Genome Project and the Genome in a Bottle project.
Detailed description of original data is available at http://sites.stan
ford.edu/abms/content/giab—reference—materials—and—data, together
with raw files in vcf and fastq formats. In our study, these data are
limited to chromosome 21 from mother, father and affected son to
satisfy Bioconductor limits for test data size and for simplicity. All
necessary vcf file operations were performed using vcftools
(Danecek et al., 2011). Details of the data preparation for the
RareVariantVis tool are provided in package vignette.

The RareVariantVis package is implemented in R and in
part based on the following existing methods: package
VariantAnnotation (Obenchain et al., 2014) and package googleVis
(Gesmann and de Castillo, 2011). The variant annotation package is
used for data import, including vcf file reading. The googleVis pack—
age is used for dynamic visualization of rare variants (JavaScript d3
library).

3 Results

The main functionalities of the RareVariantVis package are variant
filtering and visualization of rare variants and regions of homozy—
gosity (for overview, see Supplementary Table S1). A unique option
in RareVariantVis, as compared to other genome visualization tools,
is presentation of rare variants (and clusters of them) characteristic
for a particular sample. The chromosomeVis (for a single sample),
trioVis (for trio samples) and multipleVis (for multiple samples)
functions filter all variants within the sequence of a given chromo—
some and keep non—synonymous coding ones as default. In addition,
filters for dbSNP frequency (default value: <0.01) and sequencing
coverage (default threshold for read depth: >10) are applied.
Variants that pass these filters are considered rare non—synonymous
coding variants. In addition, users can filter variants by adding their
own list of variant positions to be excluded.

The chromosomeVis function provides a visualization of all vari—
ants along a particular chromosome, with the corresponding fre—
quency of the alternative allele, indicated as small blue dots (Fig. 1).
This allele frequency can be computed as the ratio of the number of

Fig. 1. Visualization of all variants on chromosome 21 from a Genome in a
Bottle Ashkenazim Trio—WGS sample. The X axis represents position along
the chromosome, whereas the Y axis displays the frequency of the alternative
allele for each variant, calculated as the ratio of alternative reads count over
the total number of reads. Blue dots represent all variants, both intergenic
and intragenic. Green dots depict single nucleotide variants that are classified
as rare, non-synonymous coding variants after the filtering. Vertical orange
lines provide the position of the centromere. The horizontal red line is a mov-
ing average of the mean frequency of the alternative allele of nearby variants
(defaults value: 2000 variants). The horizontal red line at an allele frequency
of 0.75 represents the suggested cut-off between heterozygous and homozy-
gous status for a given alternative allele

alternative variant reads to all reads in a particular genomic pos—
ition. Allelic frequency is expected at 0,5 for heterozygous variants
and 1 for homozygous, however due to sequencing errors, copy
number variation and odd coverage, the calculated frequency values
in practice vary from 0 to 1.

The rare, non—synonymous coding variants that remain after the
filtering procedure (see above) are highlighted as green dots, in the
example including four that are present in a homozygous state. As
shown in Figure 1, the tool also includes visualization of the average
frequency of the alternative allele of many nearby variants, displayed
as a moving average of a set frame length (default value: 2000 vari—
ants). This function can rapidly indicate possible homozygosity re—
gions (cut—off value: 0.75), which is often useful information in the
genetic screening of diseases with presumed autosomal recessive in—
heritance, especially if the region also contains rare variants., as dis—
played in Supplementary Figure S1. The package may also point at
regions with potential false positives that occur mainly due to tech—
nical challenges, which can be observed as a clustering of numerous
rare, non—synonymous variants in about the same chromosomal pos—
ition. In Figure 1, there are three such regions around positions 11,
15 and 46 Mb, including two regions in the centromere area that are
prone to technical mapping artifacts, since centromeres consist of
long tandem repeat stretches (Melters et al., 2013).

The various RareVariantVis functions are also applicable in som—
atic alterations, for example in analysis of cancer genomes, where
information about zygosity is essential. The trioVis function is par—
ticularly implemented for discovery of de novo variants in trio sam—
ples, and can also be useful in autosomal recessive and dominant
cases (Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3). The visualization is dynamic,
so that pointing at the variants will lead to display of an instant text
box with information about the gene, position and inheritance (i.e.
whether the variant has been inherited from mother, father or both
of parents). The user may also mark and zoom on variants of inter—
est. Potential de novo variants are ﬂagged and visualized in red

1. INTRODUCTION

Recent advances in ﬂow cytometry (Bendall et al., 2011) enable
simultaneous single-cell measurement of 30+ surface and intra-
cellular proteins. With such instruments, it is possible to meas-
ure, in a single experiment, enough markers to identify and
compare functional immune activities across nearly all cell
types in the hematopoietic lineage. However, practical
approaches to analyze and Visualize cytometry data at this
scale are only now becoming available. Qiu et a]. (2011) pro-
posed a novel algorithm, termed Spanning-tree Progression
Analysis of Density-normalized Events (SPADE), which organ-
izes cells into hierarchies of related phenotypes. The resulting
hierarchies, or trees, facilitate Visualization of developmental lin-
eages, identiﬁcation of rare cell types and comparison of func-
tional markers across stimuli.

The SPADE algorithm has four phases: density-dependent
downsampling to increase representation of rare cell types, ag-
glomerative clustering to identify related cells, minimum
spanning-tree construction to link those clusters and upsampling
to assign previously removed cells to clusters. SPADE has been
successfully applied to ﬂuorescent and mass cytometry data to

automatically recover and display the architecture of the hem-
atopoietic lineage and other complex continuums of phenotypes
from surface protein expression levels. The resulting tree repre-
sentation provides an intuitive structure on which to overlay
measurements of surface and functional proteins to identify
populations and behaviors of interest.

As cytometry datasets increase in size and dimensionality, the
performance of the computational tools researchers apply are of
increasing importance; long waits for results, particularly for ex-
ploratory tools such as SPADE, negatively impact researcher
productivity. In this note, we present CytoSPADE, a robust,
modular, cross-platform and high-performance implementation
of the SPADE algorithm and an accompanying graphical user
interface that improves performance by 12719-fold relative to the
SPADE prototype, enabling gigabyte-scale datasets to be ana-
lyzed and effectively Visualized in hours or minutes, not days.

2. CYTOSPADE IMPLEMENTATION

Figure 1 shows the structure, use and execution time of
CytoSPADE. The SPADE workﬂow is orchestrated by our
plugin for the Cytoscape network Visualization platform (Cline
et al., 2007). The plugin imports local FCS files, invokes our
multicore-optimized SPADE R package and enables interactive
Visualization of the resulting SPADE trees in the context of the
underlying cytometry data. The R package can be used inde-
pendently of the Cytoscape plugin, and other interfaces, specif-
ically an HTMLS-based web client integrated with the Cytobank
online ﬂow cytometry platform (Kotecha et al., 2010), are under
development.

The common feature of these interfaces is the capability to
simultaneously View the resulting SPADE trees and the under-
lying cytometry data and then interactively ‘gate’ the cytometry
data by their cluster assignment. In Figure 1b, the user has se-
lected the lower branch of the tree; the cells associated with those
clusters or nodes are shown in the biaxial plot of the left-hand
side of the interface. The size of a node reﬂects the relative
number of cells assigned to that node, whereas the color reﬂects
the median, fold-change or other statistic for a given parameter
for that node. This multi-modal, multi-scale Visualization enables
users to interactively Visualize the behavior of and relationships
between many different cell types in the immune system in a

users can simultaneously View the SPADE tree (right panel) and the underlying cytometry data (biaxial plot in left panel). The R package can be used

context of the underlying cytometry data.

Alongside interactively ‘gating’, researchers can use the
Cytoscape plugin to manipulate the tree by moving nodes and
changing the node color and size mappings; create ‘nested nodes’
that collapse uniform phenotypes into a single node; interactively
View statistical tests of parameter signiﬁcance for groups of
nodes and apply other Visual or quantitative operations to the
SPADE tree. A researcher might use these various capabilities to
(1) identify different cell types, e.g. T cells and B cells, and Visu-
ally organize them in a familiar pattern (as performed in Bendall
et al., 2011), then (2) overlay various surface and functional par-
ameters to quickly Visually identify differential cell populations
or behavior that may be associated with a particular disease and
(3) explore the underlying ﬂow cytometry data for populations of
interest to generate hypotheses for follow-up experiments or
for analyses with other tools such as Gemstone or ﬂowClust
(Lo et al., 2009).

The CytoSPADE R package is a faithful implementation of
the SPADE algorithm that also incorporates substantial per-
formance improvements and alternative optional implementa-
tions for specific components, e.g. clustering. CytoSPADE
builds on top of the widely used ﬂowCore R package (Hahne
et al., 2009) and thus incorporates the many different data trans-
forms and Visualization modalities it provides. The R package is
modular in design so that users can run the standard SPADE
workﬂowaiensity-dependent downsampling, clustering and tree
construction, and upsamplingior individual phases as needed.
Examples of alternative workﬂows currently in use include as-
signing newly collected data to previously generated clusters or
incorporating additional parameters, such as time, in tree
construction.

The computationally demanding components of the SPADE
algorithm are implemented in C++ using OpenMP to enable
multi-threaded execution. As shown in Figure 1c, the combin-
ation of a careful C++ implementation and multi-threaded exe-
cution results in a substantial speedup relative to the prototype
implementation. Users can run CytoSPADE on most datasets in
just minutes. If OpenMP is not available, as is often the case on

the Windows platform, CytoSPADE will default to using a single
core. However, even in single-threaded mode, the C++ imple-
mentation offers a signiﬁcant performance improvement for
SPADE users. Additional information about enabling
OpenMP is available in the online documentation.

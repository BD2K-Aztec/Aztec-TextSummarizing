Abstract

Summary: Efforts to develop peptide—based vaccines, in particular those requiring site—specific tar—
geting of self—proteins, rely on the ability to optimize the immunogenicity of the peptide epitopes.
Currently, screening of candidate vaccines is typically performed through low—throughput, high—
cost animal trials. To improve on this we present the program EplC, which enables high—throughput
prediction of peptide immunogenicity based on the endogenous occurrence of B—cell epitopes
within native protein sequences. This information informs rational selection of immunogenicity—

optimized epitopes for peptide vaccines.

1 Introduction

Vaccine development efforts are increasingly based on the formula—
tion and delivery of peptides that represent specific priority vaccine
targets (epitopes). Recently, applications of immunotherapeutics have
expanded beyond infectious diseases and into pathologies where the
immune targets are self—molecules, such as cancer, Alzheimer’s, amyo—
trophic lateral sclerosis and prion diseases. Immunotherapy for such
pathologies requires precise direction of immune responses against
self—molecules, or even against specific regions or conformations of
self—molecules. When there is the dual challenge of maintaining speci—
ficity while simultaneously overcoming immune tolerance to a self—
molecule, peptide—based vaccines remain a promising option.
Although advantaged in terms of cost, ease of production, safety and
broad therapeutic applicability, they are often disadvantaged by poor
immunogenicity (Purcell et (11., 2007).

Typically, once a protein, or a region of a protein, has been iden—
tified as a vaccine target, a panel of peptides is randomly generated
that collectively represent the entirety of the protein or region of
interest. Often the only criterion used for creation of these peptides
is length. More sophisticated investigations may incorporate in silico
screening to prioritize, but not typically optimize, different regions

based on predicted immunogenicity. Either approach ultimately
leads to the creation of a panel of vaccines that are tested for im—
munogenicity in animal models. These approaches, which typically
require iterative rounds of vaccine development and testing, are un—
desirable from efficiency, financial and ethical perspectives. A more
rational approach for in silico optimization of peptide epitopes
would provide a more direct route to the development of immuno—
genic peptide vaccines.

Several sequence—based in silico strategies have been developed
to predict immunogenic regions of a protein based on a number of
variables. These include predicted surface exposure, structural ﬂexi—
bility and occurrence of sequence elements known to correlate with
immunogenicity, such as T— and B—cell epitopes (Soria—Guerra et (11.,
2015). These methods can facilitate peptide vaccine development by
identifying a panel of candidate peptide antigens, enabling the user
to effectively generate an immune response against a target protein.
However, these methods fall short when antibody neutralization is
restricted to a specific region of a protein. Furthermore, consider—
ation of sequences based on surface—accessibility is complicated in
the context of conformation—specific targets, where epitope selection
is even more restricted. Here, a more appropriate method for

generating immunogenic epitopes occurs at the level of primary
structure through evaluation and selection of naturally occurring se—
quences containing B—cell epitopes that are predicted to possess
enhanced immunogenicity.

In our previous efforts to develop peptide—based vaccines to spe—
cific regions of the PrPC protein, the inclusion or exclusion of certain
residues ﬂanking our epitope of interest profoundly inﬂuenced im—
munogenicity where a single residue alteration resulted in a 100—fold
change in associated antibody titres (Marciniuk et 41]., 2014). This
illustrated the challenge associated with peptide epitopes and also
the opportunity to optimize epitopes through selection of appropri—
ate expansions within the protein based on defined correlations be—
tween peptide sequence and associated immunogenicity. Through
such an approach, it may be possible to utilize subtle manipulations
of a peptide epitope sequence to improve immunogenicity when the
epitope is limited by location constraints.

EpIC is a software program that allows the user to easily, quickly
and accurately increase immunogenicity through selective inclusion
of endogenous B—cell epitopes that exist within the target protein se—
quence near the epitope of interest. The optimized epitopes can then
be fused to a carrier protein possessing T—cell epitopes required for
immuno—stimulation.

2 Description of epic

Our optimization protocol involves assessing peptide epitopes that
differ by a single amino acid, constructed as a panel of expansions
around the core epitope of interest. These expansions are then pre—
sented in a repeat motif that was previously found to improve im—
munogenicity (Hedlin et 41]., 2010), and analyzed using the BepiPred
program (Larson et 41]., 2006) to identify expansions of the core epi—
tope that include B—cell epitope characteristics. BepiPred was de—
signed to analyze an entire protein sequence to identify peptide
sequences that exhibit characteristics of known immunogenic B—cell
epitopes. EpIC adapts the input/output formats of the original
BepiPred program specifically for manipulation of peptide epitopes,
thereby increasing the potential for enhanced immunogenicity and
vaccine utility.

The first two input parameters for EpIC are a file containing the
complete amino acid sequence of the target protein in FASTA for—
mat, and a file containing the core epitopes of interest. These core
epitopes consist of the smallest variant of the desired target, the ex—
pansion analysis will be performed through the iterative addition of
native residues ﬂanking a given core epitope sequence. Additional
parameters include the linker sequence, which can be inserted be—
tween expanded epitopes; the repeat pattern, which defines the re—
peat sequence in terms of the expanded epitope and linker sequence;
and the length restrictions, which limit the size of the expanded epi—
tope prior to presentation in the repeat motif (Fig. 1A). If analysis of
epitope sequence conservation across species or isoforms is required,
additional protein sequences can be added to the target protein se—
quence input file.

EpICs output displays the epitope expansions ranked based on
average BepiPred prediction score. For each expanded epitope, the
average prediction score (the sum of the scores given to each individ—
ual residue in the repeat sequence divided by the number of residues
in the repeat sequence), core epitope sequence prior to manipula—
tion, the number of N— and C—terminal residues added, the residues
represented within the target protein sequence and the expanded
epitope sequence are displayed (Fig. 1B). By selecting an epitope, the
full repeat sequence and its conservation are indicated.

Fig. 1. (A) Input parameters for EplC. Two sets of parameters are required for
analysis: the target sequence information and the desired presentation of the
epitope in the final immunizing antigen. The above figure demonstrates the
input parameters for our example prion epitope. The target protein sequence
is sheep PRNP and our site-specific minimal target sequence (or core se-
quence) is YML, in green. EplC enables the user to customize the presentation
of the optimized epitope by inserting a linker sequence, including a repeat
pattern with presentation of each repeat as forward or reverse, and the
desired expansion of the core epitope can be restricted by defining a min/
max. For our purposes, the most immunogenic format involved a forward, re-
verse, reverse presentation repeated four times with short linker sequences
between the repeats. EplC performs the immunogenicity analysis by convert-
ing the epitope expansion to the desired presentation pattern, as these fea-
tures affect the overall immunogenicity of the immunizing antigen. (B)

EpIC is designed mainly for optimization of linear epitopes.
However, vaccine development strategies often require the use of
discontinuous epitopes for effective neutralization of the target anti—
gen. Translation of discontinuous epitopes into effective peptide—
based vaccines also requires optimization of antigen presentation,
formulation and delivery. In our experience, manipulations in epi—
tope presentation patterns translate to alterations in epitope im—
munogenicity in vivo. Although this program cannot be used to
optimize discontinuous epitopes in terms of core epitope sequence
expansion, the EpIC algorithm can be employed to predict optimal
presentation patterns for discontinuous epitopes and is not com—
pletely limited to linear epitope optimization.

3 Validation

Previously, to test our manual expansion—based in silico analysis, we
evaluated the utility of the BepiPred B—cell epitope prediction algo—
rithm for the analysis of expanded core epitopes specific for the

misfolded prion protein PrPsc. Thermodynamic modeling and hy—
pothesis—based predictions suggested these core epitopes are select—
ively exposed in the misfolded isoform. A panel of vaccines of
varying degrees of predicted immunogenicity was screened in vivo.
There was a strong relationship between predicted immunogenicity
and magnitude of induced antibody titres (Marciniuk et (11., 2014).

To validate EpIC, we analyzed PrPSC—specific epitope YML,
which was previously manually optimized (Marciniuk et (11., 2014).
EpIC identified our epitope as a high—ranking expansion (Fig. 1B).
Although 2+YML+7 ranks higher, the chosen expansion better
adhered to the stringent conformation—specific restrictions required
for our application. Thus, EpIC is used to identify candidate epi—
topes from which final selections are often determined using struc—
tural/hypothesis based approaches.

4 Conclusions

EpIC builds upon existing technologies for predicting immunogen—
icity of peptides based on amino acid sequence. A key modification
is the ability for the user to rapidly and efficiently scan various pep—
tide windows within the natural sequence of a protein to identify re—
gions that are anticipated to have high immunogenicity. Although
this method was developed using prion protein sequences, it is not
specific to prions and is broadly applicable for peptide—based vaccine
design. The development of this tool is timely, as vaccine

development efforts are increasingly being applied to specific regions
of self—proteins. EpIC will provide researchers a convenient mechan—
ism for selection and optimization of peptide epitopes.

Abstract

Motivation: Over the last decades, vast numbers of sequences were deposited in public databases.
Bioinformatics tools allow homology and consequently functional inference for these sequences.
New profile—based homology search tools have been introduced, allowing reliable detection of
remote homologs, but have not been systematically benchmarked. To provide such a comparison,
which can guide bioinformatics workflows, we extend and apply our previously developed bench—
mark approach to evaluate the ’next generation’ of profile—based approaches, including CS—BLAST,
HHSEARCH and PHMMER, in comparison with the non—profile based search tools NCBl—BLAST,
USEARCH, UBLAST and FASTA.

Method: We generated challenging benchmark datasets based on protein domain architectures
within either the PFAM+C|an, SCOP/Superfamily or CATH/Gene3D domain definition schemes.
From each dataset, homologous and non—homologous protein pairs were aligned using each tool,
and standard performance metrics calculated. We further measured congruence of domain archi—
tecture assignments in the three domain databases.

Results: CSBLAST and PHMMER had overall highest accuracy. FASTA, UBLAST and USEARCH
showed large trade—offs of accuracy for speed optimization.

Conclusion: Profile methods are superior at inferring remote homologs but the difference in
accuracy between methods is relatively small. PHMMER and CSBLAST stand out with the highest ac—
curacy, yet still at a reasonable computational cost. Additionally, we show that less than 0.1% of
Swiss—Prot protein pairs considered homologous by one database are considered non—homologous
by another, implying that these classifications represent equivalent underlying biological phenom—
ena, differing mostly in coverage and granularity.

1 Introduction

Modern molecular biology relies on evolutionary conservation of
properties between entities such as genes and proteins that are hom—
ologous, i.e. share descent from a common ancestor. As a historical
property homology is unobservable but can be inferred from statis—
tically significant similarity under the proper conditions (Henikoff
and Henikoff, 1992). Through homology relationships (and within
them, specifically orthology relationships where common ancestry
dates back to a species diversification rather than a gene duplica—
tion), insights into molecular function of whole sequences (Bork
et al., 1998) or specific sites (Yao et al., 2003), 3D structure
(Chothia and Lesk, 1986), (Todd et al., 2001) or context such as
regulation can be transferred. Such transfer of results from direct ex—
perimentation to the components of the vast number of genomes for
which only molecular data is available, courtesy of ‘next—generation’
nucleotide sequencing techniques, means homology inference forms
a mainstay in bioinformatics research as well as in its applications in
organismal, clinical and evolutionary biology. These methods
started with the Smith—Waterman algorithm (Smith and Waterman,
1981) for exact computation of the minimal number of changes
needed to convert one sequence into another. Gradually more com—
plex probabilistic models were developed taking implicitly into ac—
count the structural constraints and codon properties of nucleic acid
substitutions, insertions and deletions. Sequence alignment/hom—
ology search/homology scoring methods quickly became over—
whelmed by computational complexity as database sizes increased,
prompting development of heuristic tools like FASTA (Pearson and
Lipman, 1988) or NCBI—BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990) which func—
tion fast enough to screen the whole of the known sequence universe
for similarity to a novel uncharacterized query.

With heuristic approaches come increased risk of error, and
given the potential importance of downstream applications such as
function prediction, the need becomes clear to properly evaluate the
reliability of homology inference tools. This is in itself not a trivial
problem, since such benchmarking ideally should involve a ‘gold
standard” where homology status—whether shared common ances—
try holds or not—should be known with perfect certainty, which is
in principle never the case.

The existence of well—conserved ‘building blocks” of protein se—
quence and structure, as in domain/gene families where in many
cases subtle sequence similarity is supported by clearer similarity of
the slower—evolving protein 3D structure (Chothia and Lesk, 1986),
makes for a potential workaround. Early on a preferred benchmark
was evaluating single—domain sequences from same or different
structural superfamilies as a proxy for certain positive or negative
homology status (Chandonia et al., 2004). This disregards the theor—
etical and practical difficulties which arise when domain rearrange—
ment or other forms of horizontal evolution causes mosaic gene
lineages (Vogel et al., 2004), where different regions have different
homologs, which is a complexity that the approach described here
also disregards. More tractable difficulties for homology inference
arises either when sequences have diverged too far (risk of failing to
detect homology) or are unexpectedly similar due to similar se—
quence composition biases and/or low—complexity region features
(risk of falsely inferring homology).

Several issues in creating benchmarking datasets have been dis—
cussed earlier (Aniba et al., 2010). Low—complexity regions occur
relatively seldom within well—characterized single—domain se—
quences, but will occur elsewhere in proteins, making single—domain
benchmarks underestimate the risk of false positives in genome—scale
homology inference applications. To remedy this, we previously

(Forslund and Sonnhammer, 2009) described an approach for gener—
ating ‘gold standard” test cases for homology inference by selecting
pairs of multi—domain proteins where either all corresponding do—
mains match at the super—family/clan level (positive gold standard)
or where none of them do (negative gold standard). Using this ap—
proach, we compared different low—complexity filter settings for the
NCBI—BLAST homology search tool, and found that compositional
adjustment of score matrices allowed minimization of false posi—
tives, though sometimes at the price of truncated alignments.

More recent developments in homology inference involve
profile—based tools for detecting remote homologies, using profile—
specific score matrices (PSSMs) (Gribskov et al., 1987), Hidden
Markov Models (HMMs) (Eddy, 1998) or other techniques
(Altschul et al., 1997, Altschul and Koonin, 1998). These ‘next—gen—
eration’ homology search tools may offer greater sensitivity and
search speed (Elofsson, 2002), and because of these promises, the
need for formal evaluation of their reliability arises (Muller et al.,
1999). Consequently, we expanded on our previous benchmark ap—
proach to construct an updated evaluation dataset, then tested the
latest versions of the ‘next—generation’ homology search tools for
precision, accuracy and speed.

Additionally, we applied our benchmarking method to all three
major domain family databases: SUPERFAMILY (extending SCOP,
Fox et al., 2014; Gough et al., 2001; Hubbard et al., 1999; Oates
et al., 2015), Gene3D (extending CATH, Lees et al., 2013) and
Pfam (Finn et al., 2014), where previously only Pfam was used. This
was done with the intent that the similarity of benchmark results
derived from different databases would provide a test of to what ex—
tent, beyond differences in scope or coverage, that these resources,
built from different types of data and using different curation proto—
cols, reflect the same underlying evolutionary entities seen through
different definition schemes, a question which has been raised in
some recent studies (Csaba et al., 2009).

2 Methods

As previously described (Forslund and Sonnhammer, 2009), pairs of
multi—domain proteins are seen as homologous for the purpose of
the benchmark if their domains, in consecutive order, belong to the
same family or clan (in the case of Pfam) or the same superfamily (in
the case of Gene3D or SUPERFAMILY). If no domain in the first
protein is part of the same family/clan/superfamily as any domain in
the second protein, the pair is instead considered non—homologous
for the purpose of the benchmark. Protein pairs where neither condi—
tion held are considered potentially ambiguous and not used. All do—
main architectures and sequences were acquired from the source
databases (version 28.0 of Pfam, version 1.75 of SCOP/
SUPERFAMILY, version 3.5.0 of Gene3D), retrieving all domain
matches via v53.0 of the InterPro database (Mitchell et al., 2015 ),
restricting the analysis to sequences present in SwissProt
(UniProtKB/SWiss—Prot, downloaded on August 24 2015). To ac—
count for incompleteness of present domain annotations, any se—
quence was discarded for which at least fifty consecutive residues
were not assigned to a protein domain, as has been done in previous
studies (Forslund et al., 2008; Gough, 2005). Figure 1 displays ex—
amples of homologous and non—homologous pairs based on domain
architectures from each source database.

For the specific benchmark dataset, all sequences from a specific
set of genomes were included, chosen to represent the span of
(model organism) diversity while remaining small enough to be
manageable (Sayers et al., 2012)—see Supplementary Table S1 for

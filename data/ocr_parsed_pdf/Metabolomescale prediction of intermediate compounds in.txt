ABSTRACT

Motivation: Metabolic pathway analysis is crucial not only in meta-
bolic engineering but also in rational drug design. However, the bio-
synthetic/biodegradation pathways are known only for a small portion
of metabolites, and a vast amount of pathways remain uncharacter-
ized. Therefore, an important challenge in metabolomics is the de
novo reconstruction of potential reaction networks on a metabo-
Iome-scale.

Results: In this article, we develop a novel method to predict the
multistep reaction sequences for de novo reconstruction of metabolic
pathways in the reaction-filling framework. We propose a supervised
approach to learn what we refer to as ‘multistep reaction sequence
likeness’, i.e. whether a compound—compound pair is possibly con-
verted to each other by a sequence of enzymatic reactions. In the
algorithm, we propose a recursive procedure of using step-specific
classiﬁers to predict the intermediate compounds in the multistep
reaction sequences, based on chemical substructure fingerprints/
descriptors of compounds. We further demonstrate the usefulness
of our proposed method on the prediction of enzymatic reaction net-
works from a metabolome-scale compound set and discuss charac-
teristic features of the extracted chemical substructure transformation
patterns in multistep reaction sequences. Our comprehensively pre-
dicted reaction networks help to fill the metabolic gap and to infer new
reaction sequences in metabolic pathways.

1 INTRODUCTION

Metabolic pathway analysis is crucial not only in systematic
metabolic engineering (Toya and Shimizu, 2013) but also in ra-
tional drug discovery (Ramautar et al., 2013). For example,
48.6% of cancer drugs are either natural products or their

direct derivatives (Newman and Cragg, 2012), and many
pharmaceutically useful compounds are produced by microbes,
fungi and plants (Nakabayashi and Saito, 2013). It is estimated
that plants produce at least 1060 000 metabolites (Afendi et al.,
2012), and the total number of natural products is undoubtedly
much larger if microbes and fungi are also considered. However,
the biosynthetic/biodegradation pathways are known only for a
small portion of metabolites, and a vast amount of pathways
remain uncharacterized even in human (Sreekumar et al.,
2009). For example, International Union of Biochemistry and
Molecular Biology recognizes only ~6000 enzymatic reactions
(McDonald and Tipton, 2014). Therefore, in silico prediction
of unknown pathways is expected to support the experimental
characterization, leading to beneﬁt not only drug discovery and
health care but also agricultural and environmental issues.

There have been many successful studies on computational
reconstruction of metabolic pathways in organisms or in speciﬁc
conditions of cellular processes. The most traditional approach is
‘reference-based framework’, where enzyme genes are mapped to
appropriate positions in the predefined reference pathways using
orthologous and other information across different organisms or
conditions (Bono et al., 1998). This framework is dependent on
the predefined reference pathways, i.e. the collection of charac-
terized substrateiproduct relationships that have been described
in the literature or experimentally validated. Thus, this is not
applicable to predicting unknown substrateiproduct relation-
ships or completely new metabolic pathways.

In contrast, a variety of computational methods have been
developed for de novo reconstruction of new metabolic pathways
based on chemical structure data of metabolites. The goal is to
elucidate novel reactions (absent from the reference pathway
maps in the reference-based framework) based on our current
knowledge about known reactions and chemical transformations
(to be used as training data). The previous methods are mainly
classiﬁed into ‘compound—ﬁlling framework’ and ‘reaction-ﬁlling
framework’. The compound-filling framework generates the
chemical structures of the intermediates even if they are not pre-
sent in databases. The users input the start (source) compound
and/or the goal (target) compound, and the methods predict
intermediates and reactions between the two compounds

(Darvas, 1988; Ellis et al., 2008; Greene et al., 1999; Moriya
et al., 2010; Talafous et al., 1994).

On the other hand, the reaction-ﬁlling framework does not
generate unknown chemical compounds, but use the compounds
that are already present in databases. The users input a group of
compounds, or vast amount of compounds in databases, and the
methods predict the connectivity among the compounds, i.e. sub-
strateiproduct pairs in a reaction (Hatzimanikatis et al., 2005;
Kotera et al., 2008a, 2013a,b; Nakamura et al., 2012; Tanaka
et al., 2009). The previous de novo metabolic pathway reconstruc-
tion studies handled single reactions independently. Although
metabolic network involves some sequential reactions whose
chemical transformation patterns are conserved (Muto et al.,
2013), these conserved patterns have not been considered.

In this article, we develop a novel method to predict the multi-
step reaction sequences for de novo reconstruction of metabolic
pathways in the reaction-ﬁlling framework. We propose a super-
vised approach to learn what we refer to as ‘multistep reaction
sequence likeness’, i.e. whether a compoundicompound pair is
possibly converted to each other by multiple enzymatic reactions,
as an extension of the previous work (Kotera et al., 2013b). In
the algorithm, we propose a recursive procedure of using step-
speciﬁc classiﬁers to predict the intermediate compounds in the
multistep reaction sequences, based on chemical substructures.
We further demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed method
on the prediction of enzymatic reaction networks from a meta-
bolome-scale compound set and discuss characteristic features of
multistep reaction sequences. Our comprehensively predicted
reaction networks help to ﬁll the metabolic gap and to infer
new reaction sequences in metabolic pathways.

2 MATERIALS

2.1 Enzymatic reactions and reactant pairs

We retrieved enzymatic reactions and the associated chemical
compounds from the KEGG database (Kanehisa et al., 2012).
Chemical compounds are given IDs consisting of the letter ‘C’
and the following ﬁve-digit numerals, and the structures are
described as graphs where nodes and edges represent atoms
and bonds, respectively. Hydrogen atoms are not explicitly rep-
resented as nodes but are included in the accompanying atoms.
For example, the compounds D-glucose (C00031) and D-glucose
6—phosphate (C00092) consist of 12 and 16 nodes, respectively.
KEGG describes reactions not only as conventional reaction
equation format but also as ‘reactant pair’ format (RPAIR;
Kotera et al., 2004), representing substrateiproduct relationships
with conserved chemical moiety in the reaction. For example, the
pair D-glucose (12 nodes) and D-glucose 6-phosphate (16 nodes)
conserves 12 nodes (corresponding to the glucose residue) during
the reaction (see http://www.kegg.jp/entry/RP00060). As of
January 2014, KEGG RPAIR stores 14386 reactant pairs.

2.2 Positive/negative dataset for single reactions

In this study, the ‘main’ type of reactant pairs [the compoundi
compound pairs in the KEGG RPAIR database; see Kotera et al.
(2013b)] were regarded as the positive examples, and the remaining
all possible pairs of compounds were regarded as the negative
examples for predicting enzymatic-reaction likeness. Each

compoundwompound pair has to be described in both forward
and backward directions, avoiding the loss of the similarity in
backward reactions. Considering these, the number of all possible
compound pairs is n(n71) = 0(n2), where n is the number of com-
pounds. We regard these positive/negative substrateiproduct rela-
tionships as the gold standard data.

It is known that most compound pairs in the negative ex-
amples are structurally dissimilar. In other words, it is easy to
predict that dissimilar compound pairs are unlikely to be con-
verted to each other by single enzymatic reactions. Thus, incorp-
oration of structural dissimilar pairs in the prediction would
overestimate the prediction accuracy in the performance evalu-
ation. To avoid such trivial predictions, we removed compound
pairs whose Tanimoto coefﬁcient (Jaccard coefﬁcient) are <0.5
from the gold standard data and constructed the filtered data
consisting of compound pairs whose structures are similar to
some extent. Note that classiﬁcation is more difﬁcult for the
filtered data compared with the full data.

2.3 Positive/negative dataset for k-step reaction sequences

In the ﬁeld of enzymology, the term ‘multistep reaction’ some-
times means a series of chemical transformations catalyzed by an
enzyme. In this article, we do not deal with multistep in that
context. To avoid the confusion, we use the term ‘k—step reaction
sequences’ or ‘k-step sequences’ for a series of chemical trans-
formations catalyzed by k enzymes within a metabolic pathway.
One-step sequences correspond to single reactions.

We prepared the positive and negative examples of k-step re-
action sequences as follows (where k = 2, 3, 4).

(1) k-step reaction sequences consisting of k -I- 1 compounds
were generated using k reactant pairs sharing common
compounds. For example, from the three reactant pairs
‘CrCz’, ‘C17C3’ and ‘C37C4’ (where C” represents a com-
pound ID), two 2-step sequences ‘CTC17C3’ and ‘CrCr
C4’ and a 3-step sequence ‘CTC17C37C4’ were generated.
The ﬁrst and the last compounds in the sequence were
referred to as the start and the goal compounds,
respectively.

(2) Using the RPAIR database, the conservation ratio of the
atoms from the start compound to the goal compound was
calculated for each k-step sequence. For example, consider
that C1, C2, C3 and C4 consists of 18, 20, 23 and 24 nodes
(i.e. atoms other than hydrogen atoms), respectively, and
the pair ‘C 17C; conserve 18 nodes, the conservation ratio
of the step ‘CrCz’ is 18/18 = 1.0 and that of‘CfCl’ is 18/
20 = 0.9, respectively. When the 17 nodes from the con-
served nodes in ‘CTC 1’ are conserved in ‘C 17C3’, the con-
servation ratio of the step ‘C27C17C3’ is 17/20 = 0.85. In
this study, the k-step sequences with the monotonic in-
crease of the numbers of the nodes and the conservation
ratio 30.5 were regarded as positive examples. The re-
maining k-step sequences were regarded as negative
examples.

As a result of the data ﬁltering, the numbers of positive
examples of 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-step sequences were 10852, 4294,
8073 and 15112, respectively, and the numbers of negative ex-
amples in those are 518854, 75170, 258883 and 1138 634,

respectively. Note that the deﬁnitions of positive/negative ex-
amples in 1-step and the longer-steps were different, resulting
in the numbers of positive/negative examples not in monotonic
increase.

2.4 Vector representation of chemical structures

We obtained chemical structures of compounds (metabolites) from
the KEGG (Kanehisa et al., 2012) and KNApSAcK (Afendi et al.,
2012) databases. Chemically identical compounds with the same
structures (duplicates) were removed, so structures of all com-
pounds in the dataset were unique. We described each compound
by using KEGG Chemical Function and Substructures (KCF—S;
Kotera et al., 2013a), which was designed based on the numbers of
functional group and other named biochemical substructures in a
molecule (Kotera et al., 2008b). We represented each compound by
an integer vector of length 53 679 in which the occurrence of a
substructure is coded as an integer value.

For a comparison study, we also tested many other chemical
ﬁngerprints by using Chemistry Development Kit (CDK;
Steinbeck et al., 2003) and the descriptor deﬁned by Nakamura,
Sakakibara and colleagues (Nakamura et al., 2012), referred to as
‘NS-descriptor’ in this study. The NS-descriptor is an integer
vector, and the other ﬁngerprints are binary vectors. We calcu-
lated eight fingerprints/descriptors: CDK extended ﬁngerprint,
CDK graph-only ﬁngerprint, CDK hybridization fingerprint, E-
state fingerprint, KlekotaiRoth ﬁngerprint, Molecular ACCess
System (MACCS) ﬁngerprint, PubChem ﬁngerprint and NS-de-
scriptor, and their dimensions were 1022, 1024, 1024, 71, 4860,
164, 879 and 1346, respectively, where the feature elements absent
from the compound set are not considered.

2.5 Reaction module

Metabolic network involves some sequential reactions whose
chemical transformation patterns are conserved, and these con-
served sequences are referred to as ‘reaction modules’ (Muto et al.,
2013). They consist of purely chemical data without incorporating
any enzyme data (genes and proteins). As of January 2014, there
are 34 manually curated reaction modules that are given IDs con-
sisting of the letters ‘RM’ and the following three-digit numerals
(such as RM001; see http://www.genome.jp/kegg/reaction/rmo-
dule.html) and up to 3016 conserved reaction patterns. In this
study, KEGG reaction modules were used for the analysis of
the chemical substructures characteristic to k-step sequences.

3 METHODS

We address the problem of metabolome-scale metabolic pathway recon-
struction in the reaction-ﬁlling framework. In this section, we present a
general approach to evaluate the enzymatic-reaction likeness of any pair
of two compounds and to estimate potential intermediate chemical struc-
tures between the two compounds.

3.1 Feature vector representation of compound—compound
pairs

We represent a compound C by a D-dimensional integer vector (an

integer vector of length D) as <I>(C)=(c1, cz, ..., cD)T, where ck e Z, k=

1, ..., D and each element corresponds to the number of times a given

chemical substructure from a library of deﬁned substructures occurs in

the compound. To characterize any pair of two compounds C and C, we
introduce two kinds of operations for the descriptors as follows:

(“MO /\ ¢(C’))=(mi11(61,6’1),mi11(62,6’2),  mill(6n, 691))
and

(<I>(C)e<1>(C’))=(max(c1 — 6’1,0),max(62 — 6’2, 0), ...,
max(c,, — c’n, 0)).

where min(ck, c’k) is a function that returns ck if ck 5 c’k and otherwise
returns c’k, and max(ck,c’k) is a function that returns ck if ck 3 c’k
and otherwise returns c’k. Note that (<I>(C) /\ <I>(C’)) is an operation
that captures common chemical substructures between <I>(C) and <I>(C’),
whereas (<I>(C)e<1>(C’)) is an operation that captures chemical substruc-
tures present in <I>(C) and absent in <I>(C’).

To represent any compoundwompound pair using the above oper-
ations, we deﬁne two types of feature vectors as follows:

“NC, C’)=(<1>(C) /\ <1>(C’), c1>(C)9<1>(C’), <1>(C”)9<1>(C))T
and
“MC, C’) = (<1>(C)9<1>(C'), c1>(C’)9<1>(C))T-

We shall refer to <I>(C, C’) and <I>(C, C’) as ‘diff-common feature vector’
and ‘diff-only feature vector’, respectively (Fig. 1a). Both feature vectors
can handle reversible reactions, and they are designed to capture sub-
structure changes around the reaction center in the conversion of a chem-
ical compound to another compound. In addition, the diff-common
feature vector is designed to capture conserved substructures kept in
the conversion of a chemical compound to another compound.

3.2 Multistep reaction sequence-likeness prediction

3.2.] Enzymatic-reaction likeness We make a brief review of the
previous method to predict the enzymatic-reaction likeness, i.e. whether
a compoundwompound pair is possibly converted to each other by an
enzymatic reaction (Kotera et al., 2013b), which is solved by the following
supervised classiﬁcation problem.

Using the feature vectors <I>(C, C’) and <I>(C, C’) for compounds Cand
C, we apply a linear model to estimate a linear function
f(C, C’) = wT<I>(C, C’), where w is a weight vector. The enzymatic-reaction
likeness between C and C is predicted by thresholding the value of
f(C, C). The weight vector w is estimated such that it can correctly predict
the enzymatic-reaction likeness of compoundicompound pairs.

A limitation of the previous method is that the method is only applic-
able to single reactions. Thus, in this study, we generalize it for the use of
multistep reaction sequences as described in the following sections.

3.2.2 M ultistep reaction sequence likeness Here we propose an ex-
tension of the enzymatic-reaction likeness from single reactions to multi-
step sequences. Let k be the number of reaction steps.

A k-step reaction sequence is deﬁned as a series of reactions in which a
chemical compound is known to be converted to another compound by
multiple enzymatic reactions, and the corresponding (k7 1) intermediate
compounds are missing. To evaluate the enzymatic-reaction likeness of k-
step reaction sequence, we estimate a linear function fk(C, C’) that would
predict whether a chemical compound C is converted to another com-
pound C by k enzymatic reactions.

Using the feature vectors <I>(C, C’) and <I>(C, C’) for compounds Cand
C, we propose to learn a linear function fk(C , C’) = wkTEI>(C, C’), where wk
is a weight vector, and the weight vector wk is estimated such that it can
correctly predict k-step reaction sequence likeness.

Given a collection of compoundicompound pairs and their labels
(<I>(C,-, CJ-),y,-Jy(), where ya), 6 {-I- 1, —1}(i= 1, ..., n,j= 1, ...,n, i #1") and
yifk = -I- 1 (resp. yijk = — 1) indicates a positive pair (resp. a negative
pair) in the k-step reaction, we estimate the weight vector wk by linear

of uninformative features zeros without loss of classiﬁcation accuracy.
Ll-regularized linear SVM is referred to as LISVM.

For example, the prediction for l-step, 2-step, 3-step and 4-step reac-
tion sequence likeness can be performed as follows:

Enzymatic reaction-likeness prediction

We construct a functionf1(C, C’) = w1T<I>(C, C’) based on a learning
set of compoundicompound pairs in known single reactions. We
then apply f1 to a given compoundicompound pair to predict
whether the two compounds in the pair are interconvertible by one
enzymatic reaction.

2-step reaction sequence-likeness prediction

We construct a function f2(C, C’) = szEI>(C, C’) based on a learning
set of compoundwompound pairs in known 2-step sequences. We
then apply f2 to a given compoundicompound pair to predict
whether the two compounds in the pair are interconvertible by two
enzymatic reactions.

3—step reaction sequence-likeness prediction

We construct a functionf3(C, C’) = W3T<I>(C, C’) based on a learning
set of compoundwompound pairs in known 3-step reaction se-
quences. We then apply f3 to a given compoundwompound pair
to predict whether the two compounds in the pair are interconvert-
ible by three enzymatic reactions.

4-step reaction sequence-likeness prediction

We construct a functionf4(C, C’) = W4T<I>(C, C’) based on a learning
set of compoundwompound pairs in known 4-step reaction se-
quences. We then apply f4 to a given compoundwompound pair
to predict whether the two compounds in the pair are interconvert-
ible by four enzymatic reactions.

3.3 Intermediate compound prediction in the multistep
reaction sequences

Given a pair of start (source) compound C mm and goal (target) compound
Cg“, in the k-step reaction sequence, we attempt to estimate potential
intermediate compounds C236,, C126,, . . . , C122,” between the start com-
pound C mm and the goal compound Cgml. Note that there are (kil) inter-
mediate compounds between the start compound Cmm and the goal
compound Cgoa, in the k-step reaction sequence (Fig. 2).

Suppose that we have a chemical database storing a huge number of
chemical compounds, and we consider selecting potential compounds from
the database for the intermediate compounds in the k-step reaction se-
quence. The j-th intermediate compound CEQM is considered convertible
from the start compound Cm", by single reactions (l-step sequences) and is
also considered convertible from the goal compound Cgoa, by (k -I- 17])-
step sequence. Therefore, we propose the following candidate score to
select an appropriate compound for thej-th intermediate compound C126,
(1': 1, 2, . . . , (k — 1)) by integrating individual reaction sequence-likeness
evaluation functions f1 , f2, . . . ,faﬁl) in a recursive manner:

szkc) =f,-(C.,,,,, C) +16.+ Hm, CW).

In practice, high-scoring compounds in the database are predicted to
be candidates for the intermediate compounds.

For example, we propose the candidate scores for the 2-step, 3-step
and 4-step reaction sequences as follows:

2-step reaction sequence with one intermediate compound

The intermediate compound is connected with the start com-
pound by one step and with the goal compound by one step, so
we propose the following candidate score for the intermediate com-
pound:

S2(C) =f1(Cstarb C) +f1(C, Cgoal)-

2. k-step reaction sequences and intermediate compound prediction

3—step reaction sequence with two intermediate compounds

The ﬁrst intermediate compound is connected with the start com-
pound by one step and with the goal compound by two steps, so we
propose the following candidate score for the ﬁrst intermediate com-
pound:

s§1)(C) =f1(Cm,,, C) +f2(C, CW1).

The second intermediate compound is connected with the start com-
pound by two steps and with the goal compound by one step, so we
propose the following candidate score for the second intermediate
compound:

Sykc) =f2(Cstart , C) +f1(C, Cgoal).

4-step reaction sequence with three intermediate compounds

The ﬁrst intermediate compound is connected with the start com-
pound by one step and with the goal compound by three steps, so we
propose the following candidate score for the ﬁrst intermediate com-
pound:

m©mmmowm%w

The second intermediate compound is connected with the start com-
pound by two steps and with the goal compound by two steps, so we
propose the following candidate score for the second intermediate
compound:

s12)(C) =f2(Cmm C) +f2(C, Cami)"

The third intermediate compound is connected with the start com-
pound by three steps and with the goal compound by one step, so we
propose the following candidate score for the third intermediate
compound:

ﬁ©mmmomm%w

Practical application

In practice, we do not know how many reaction steps are
there between the start compound Cm”, and the goal

compound Cgml, so we propose the following recursive procedure
(Fig. 1b):

(1) If f1(Cm,,, Cgoa,)>0, C mm and Cgoa, are predicted to be converted
to each other.

  f1(Cstart, Cgoal) S 0 and f2(Cstart, Cgoal)>oa the intermediate
compound is predicted with s2(C).

(3) If f2(C.mm, Cgoal) S 0 and f3(Cm,,, Cgoa,)>0, the intermediate
compounds are predicted with sgl)(C) and sgz)(C).

(4) If f3(Cmn, Cgoal) S 0 and f4(Csmm Cgoal)>oa the intermediate
compounds are predicted with sgl)(C), sf)(C) and s513)(C).

(5) To be continued in a recursive manner.

3.4 Experimental evaluation protocol

3.4.] Cross-validation experiment on reaction sequence-likeness
prediction We perform the following S-fold cross-validation. (i) We
randomly split compoundicompound pairs in the gold standard reaction
data into five subsets of roughly equal sizes. We regard known startigoal
compound pairs (the ﬁrst and the last compounds in the sequence) as
positive examples and the other compoundwompound pairs as negative
examples. (ii) We take each subset as a test set and the remaining four
subsets as a training set. (iii) We learn a predictive model based only on
the training set. (iv) We compute the prediction scores for compound7
compound pairs in the test set. (v) Finally, we evaluate the prediction
accuracy over the S-folds.

We evaluate the prediction performance by the receiver operating char-
acteristic (ROC) curve, which is a plot of true-positive rates as a function of
false-positive rates based on various thresholds, and the precision-recall
(PR) curve, which is a plot of precision (positive predictive value) as a
function of recall (sensitivity) based on various thresholds. We summarize
the performance by the area under the ROC curve (AUC) score, where 1 is
for a perfect inference and 0.5 is for a random inference, and the area under
the PR curve (AUPR) score, where 1 is for a perfect inference and the ratio
of positive examples in the gold standard data is for a random inference.

In this study, we perform the above cross-validation experiments for 1-,
2-, 3- and 4-step reaction sequences, separately (see Section 4.1). In each
case, we repeat the cross-validation experiment ﬁve times, and computed
the averages of the AUC scores and the AUPR scores over the ﬁve cross-
validation folds. The parameters involved in the methods are optimized
with the AUC score and the AUPR score as the objective functions.

3.4.2 Self-rank test on intermediate compound prediction We
conduct a self-rank test to simulate the intermediate compound predic-
tion. The procedure of the self-rank test is as follows: (i) we take inter-
mediate compounds in known k-step reaction sequences and regard them
as missing intermediate compounds (to be tested), (ii) we compute the
candidate scores for all candidate compounds in the chemical database
and the intermediate compounds being tested, (iii) we rank the intermedi-
ate compounds based on the candidate scores among all candidate com-
pounds plus themselves and (iv) we repeat the above steps for all the
k-step reaction sequences. Note that we test one intermediate compound
for the 2-step reaction, two intermediate compounds for the 3-step reac-
tion and three intermediate compounds for the 4-step reaction.

In this study, we conduct the above self-rank test for 2-, 3- and 4-step
reaction sequences, separately (see Section 4.2). A self-rank of 1 is a
perfect prediction, indicating that the method is able to assign the test
compound to the original position in the k-step reaction sequence. In the
case of random prediction, the self-rank follows the uniform distribution
on the interval from 1 to the number of candidate compounds in the
chemical database.

3.5 Baseline method

3.5 .1 Reaction sequence-likeness prediction The most straightfor-
ward method for the reaction sequence-likeness prediction is a similarity-
based approach, assuming that the start compound and the goal com-
pound are likely to have similar chemical structures. Actually, a substrate
compound and a product compound in an enzyme reaction tend to have
a big conserved substructure, and their different regions tend to be small
(Kotera et al., 2008a), so the start compound and the goal compound in
the k-step reaction sequences are expected to have high chemical structure
similarity. We use weighted J accard similarity for binary ﬁngerprints and
cosine correlation coefficient for real-valued descriptors as chemical struc-
ture similarity measures of two compounds. A direct strategy is therefore
to predict the k-step reaction sequence-likeness between the start and goal
compounds whenever the chemical structure similarity value between the
start and goal compounds is above a threshold to be determined. We refer
to this approach as BASELINE.

3.5.2 Intermediate compound prediction In a similar manner as the
reaction sequence-likeness prediction, we deﬁne a baseline method for the
intermediate compound prediction, assuming that the intermediate com-
pounds are likely to have similar chemical structures both with the start
compound and with the goal compound. The candidate score in the
k-step sequence is deﬁned as the sum of the chemical structure similarity
between the candidate and start compounds and the chemical structure
similarity between the candidate and goal compounds. We refer to this
approach as BASELINE.

4 RESULTS

4.1 Performance evaluation on multistep reaction
sequence-likeness prediction

We tested the proposed L1SVM method on its ability to predict
the multistep reaction sequence likeness of given compoundi
compound pairs from their chemical ﬁngerprint/descriptor data
by performing 5-fold cross-validation experiments (see Section
3.4.1 for more details). We evaluated the performance of the
method for 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-step reaction sequence likeness, sep-
arately. We also compared the performance between nine chem-
ical ﬁngerprints/descriptors: CDK extended ﬁngerprint, CDK
graph-only fingerprint, CDK hybridization fingerprint, E-state
ﬁngerprint, KlekotaiRoth ﬁngerprint, MACCS fingerprint,
PubChem fingerprint, NS-descriptor and KCF-S descriptor
(see Section 2.4 for more details). Note that KCF—S is the de-
scriptor we proposed to use in this study.

Table 1, 2, 3 and 4 show the resulting AUC and AUPR scores
for the 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-step reaction sequence-likeness predic-
tions, respectively (full tables are shown in Supplementary

Material). Among the nine chemical fingerprints/descriptors,
the KCF—S descriptor achieved the highest prediction accuracy
in any kinds of enzymatic reactions. The L1SVM method clearly
outperformed the BASELINE method regardless of fingerprints,
which suggests that supervised learning is meaningful for reac-
tion prediction. These results suggest that the proposed L1SVM
method with the KCF—S descriptor is expected to be useful in
practice.

The AUC and AUPR scores of BASELINE were relatively
high regardless of ﬁngerprints in the case of single reactions,
which validated the fact that a core substructure is conserved
between a substrate and a product in a reactant pair. On the
other hand, the AUC and AUPR scores of BASELINE were
low regardless of fingerprints in the case of k enzymatic reactions
where k = 2, 3, 4. This result suggests that a core substructure
conserved from the start to the goal compounds tends to be
smaller in the k-step sequences, compared with 1-step reactions.
The diff-common feature vector worked better than the diff-only
feature vector in most cases. This result also implies that both
substructure transformation patterns and core substructures are
important in the k-step sequence prediction.

4.2 Performance evaluation on intermediate compound
prediction

We tested the proposed recursive L1SVM method with the diff-
common feature vector on its ability to infer intermediate com-
pounds in the k-step sequences. We evaluated the performance
by conducting a self-rank test, which simulates the situation
where we want to detect a series of intermediate compounds
between a start compound and a goal compound (see Section
3.4.2 for more details). We evaluated the performance of the
proposed method for 2-, 3- and 4-step sequences, separately.

Figure 3 shows the distributions of the computed self-ranks for
the 2-, 3- and 4-step sequences, where the self-rank scores are
shown on a log scale with base 10 in each panel, and the left box-
plot corresponds to the random inference, the middle box-plot
corresponds to the BASELINE method and the right box-plot
corresponds to the proposed L1SVM method, respectively. Note
that there are 1, 2 and 3 intermediate compounds in the 2-, 3- and
4-step sequences, respectively.

In both BASELINE and L1SVM, the self-rank distributions
have a large peak at high ranks at a signiﬁcant level (the P—value
is almost zero), which means that both the methods are capable
of predicting most known intermediate compounds correctly,
compared with the random inference. The L1SVM method

usually outperforms the BASELINE method in terms of the
average of the computed self-ranks. An exception was observed
using the median of the self-ranks in the case of the second inter-
mediate compound of 4-step sequence, but the corresponding
averages of the self-ranks in BASELINE and L1SVM are 249
and 146, respectively. These results suggest that potential inter-
mediate compounds tend to be strongly correlated with the start
and the goal compounds on metabolic pathways in terms of
chemical transformation patterns.

4.3 Biochemical interpretation of the extracted
substructures speciﬁc to k-step sequences

We analyzed the characteristics of the extracted substructures as
follows. First, k-step-speciﬁc substructures were deﬁned as the
substructures whose obtained weights were above zero only in
the L1SVM for the k-step sequences. Second, among all k-step
sequences, those that contain the k-step-speciﬁc substructures in
the start or the goal compounds were selected. Third, the ob-
tained k-step sequences were ranked according to the average

weights of the k-step-speciﬁc substructures. Finally, the obtained
k-step sequences were compared with the reaction modules and
the conserved reaction patterns.

As the result, the numbers of the obtained k-step sequences
with k-step-speciﬁc substructures were 13264, 3630, 3877 and
5276 for k = 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Among those, the num-
bers of the k-step sequences that correspond to the conserved
reaction patterns were 0, 507, 114 and 44, respectively.

Figure 4 shows some correctly predicted examples of k-step
reaction sequences that corresponds to reaction modules, with
the k-step-speciﬁc substructures and reaction centers highlighted
in green and red, respectively. It was observed that the k-step-
speciﬁc substructures generally do not contain reaction centers,
i.e. the substructures that changes during reactions. This is
understandable because the substructures that contain reaction
centers are so common in metabolic pathways that they cannot
be used to distinguish k-step reaction sequence likeness.

Although the k-step-speciﬁc substructures were involved in the
conserved substructures in the start and the goal compounds, the

Fig. 4. Extracted substructures speciﬁc to k-step reaction sequences
(green) and reaction center-related substructures (red)

k-step-specific substructures were not necessarily equal to the
conserved substructures. For example, the first two 2-step reac-
tion sequences in Figure 4a correspond to a reaction module
RM004 [dihydroxylation of aromatic ring, type I (dioxygenase
and dehydrogenase reactions)]. As shown in the ﬁgure, carbon
atoms in the substituted aromatic rings were extracted as the

k-step-speciﬁc substructures in these sequences. However, al-
though RM004 contains 13 reaction sequences, it appeared
that only the simplest reaction sequence, i.e. from benzene
(C01407) to catechol (C00090), did not have any k-step-speciﬁc
substructures. A possible interpretation for these observations
would be that benzene ring, not substituted aromatic rings,
was too common to be used to distinguish k-step reaction
likeness.

As another example of 2-step sequences, the extracted sub-
structures from sequence ‘Indole-3-acetonitrile (C02938) -
Indole-3-acetamide (C02693) - Indole-3-acetate (C00954)’, part
of RM031 (oxime to acetate conversion), also was in conserved
substructure (pyrrole ring) rather than the reaction center-related
substructures (nitrile and carboxylate).

Degradation of aromatic compounds consists of three types of
reaction modules, preprocessing, dihydroxylation and cleavage,
and they can be classiﬁed into aerobic or anaerobic types (Muto
et al., 2013). Characteristic substructures were extracted from all
3-step sequences in RM003, a preprocessing module. Also, in this
case, extracted substructures were not on reaction centers but on
conserved substructures, as shown in Figure 4b. The anaerobic
equivalent, RM015 (methyl to carboxyl conversion on aromatic
ring, anaerobic), did not include characteristic substructures.

Some other representative modules, i.e. the dihydroxylation
module RM004 and the following cleavage [3-step sequences ‘bi-
phenyl (C06588) - cis-2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl
(C06589) - biphenyl-2,3-diol (C02526) - 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6—phe—
nylhexa-2,4-dienoate (C01273)’ and ‘4-chlorobiphenyl (C06584)
- cis-2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxy-4’-chlorobiphenyl (C06585) - 2,3-
dihydroxy—4’-chlorobiphenyl (C06586) - 2-hydr0xy-6—0x0-6—(4’-
chlorophenyl)-hexa-2,4-dienoate (C06587)’], and RM017 (ring
cleavage via BaeyeriVilliger oxidation; Figure 40), was also ex-
tracted. There were some more sequences [e.g. ‘benzamide
(C09815) - benzoate (C00180) - 4—hydroxybenzoate (C00156)

These results suggest that more intensive investigation would
help the manual curation of reaction modules.

4.4 Novel prediction of multiple reaction sequences

Having conﬁrmed the usefulness of our method, we conducted a
comprehensive reaction prediction for all possible compound
pairs. We trained a predictive model using all known reactant
pairs in the gold standard data, and novel multiple reaction se-
quences were predicted using the KNApSAcK database. Start
and goal compounds for this prediction were prepared by ex-
tracting compound pairs that are not too similar and not too
dissimilar (weighted J accard coefﬁcient between 0.6 and 0.7). The
computation time was ~4h using 40 threads in two CPUs.

The number of predicted 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-step sequences were
2499 982, 297 295, 18164 and 16128, respectively. The advan-
tage of reaction-ﬁlling approach is the quick calculation for this
huge amount of pathways, which has not been possible in com-
pound-ﬁlling approach to date. It is difﬁcult to confirm how
many of these are true positiveiit was naturally observed that
there were some predicted sequences whose intermediate is pos-
sibly correct, but the number of steps is possibly wrong, and vice
versa. Examples are shown in Figure 5. Stereoisomers and geo-
metric isomers were not distinguishable, which is a common dis-
advantage of using vectors including KCF-S and other
ﬁngerprints. Even though our proposed method enabled quick
calculation for metabolome-scale compound sets with better
AUC and AUPR, there is still room to improve, especially
AUPR, for more practical use.

5 DISCUSSION

This study provided a general method to predict the number of
reactions to connect two metabolites. The more the number of
known reactions increases, the better the predictive performance
would become. However, the recursive strategy chooses the smal-
lest number of steps with the fewest numbers of intermediates for
given startegoal compounds. There are some known cases where
different organisms synthesize the same compounds using

different pathways with different number of steps. The further
extension will be needed to obtain possible longer pathways with
keeping the computation efﬁciency.

This study used a predeﬁned set of chemical substructures
(KCF-S); however, it is known that some metabolic pathways
use their characteristic chemical substructures. This may imply
that when the users want to predict pathways for a speciﬁc group
of metabolites, using the common substructures in multiple me-
tabolites (Kotera et al., 2011) would detect the metabolite-group-
speciﬁc substructures, leading to the improvement of the speciﬁc
pathways.

The preparation of positive and negative examples is crucial in
this study. In the study of enzymatic reaction likeness (1-step
likeness), distinction of positive/negative is relatively clear;
positive if a compound pair corresponds to a known substratee
product pair and negative otherwise. In the study of multiple
reaction sequence likeness, reversibility of reaction may affect
the distinction of positive/negative. Enzymatic reactions are gen-
erally reversible in vitro, but they are sometimes irreversible
in vivo depending on the physiological condition. These
reversibilities are merely described in databases, making it difﬁ-
cult to distinguish positive/negative multistep reaction sequences.

Recent metabolomics studies enable metabolite-driven
approaches for understanding previously unknown biosynthetic
mechanisms at the gene level for genome-sequenced plants
(Nakabayashi and Saito, 2013). We believe that this study will
contribute to the understanding and the identiﬁcation of metab-
olites and genes in the biosynthetic machinery.

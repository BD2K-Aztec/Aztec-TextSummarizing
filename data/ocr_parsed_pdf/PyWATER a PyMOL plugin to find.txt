ABSTRACT

Summary: Conserved water molecules play a crucial role in protein
structure, stabilization of secondary structure, protein activity, flexibil-
ity and ligand binding. Clustering of water molecules in superimposed
protein structures, obtained by X-ray crystallography at high reso-
lution, is an established method to identify consensus water molecules
in all known protein structures of the same family. PyWATER is an
easy-to-use PyMOL plug-in and identifies conserved water molecules
in the protein structure of interest. PyWATER can be installed via the
user interface of PyMOL. No programming or command-line know-
ledge is required for its use.

Availability and Implementation: PyWATER and a tutorial are avail-
able at https://github.com/hiteshpatel379/PyWATER. PyMOL is avail-
able at http://www.pymol.org/ or http://sourceforge.net/projects/
pymol/.

1 INTRODUCTION

Water molecules play a crucial role in protein structures, their
stabilization, ﬂexibility and activity. One approach to ﬁnding
conserved water molecules is to calculate energy terms of the
molecules in protein structure models. That can be achieved by
energy minimization, molecular dynamics simulations or quan-
tum mechanics. GRID determines energetically favorable bind-
ing sites for water molecules (Goodford, 1985); Rank uses the
HINT force ﬁeld and classiﬁes water molecules based on the
number of hydrogen bonds and their binding strength (Kellogg
and Abraham, 2000; Kellogg and Chen, 2004). These methods
are precise and can be applied to a single available structure but
they are computationally expensive and only applicable for
expert users. If many crystal structures are available for a pro-
tein, conserved water molecules can be also determined Via clus-
ter analysis and electron density of existing crystal structures.
The method WaterScore uses a regression analysis to establish
a statistical correlation between the structural properties of water
molecules of a free protein crystal structure compared with the
ligand complexed form (Garcia-Sosa et al., 2003). Bos and Pleiss
predicted six conserved water molecules located at the Q-loop in
class A ﬂ-lactamases with the WatCH software (Sanschagrin and

Kuhn, 1998) and showed that these conserved water molecules
reduce the ﬂexibility of the Q-loop (Bos and Pleiss, 2008). A
similar approach has been used to identify and analyze the con-
sensus water sites in thrombin and trypsin. These highly con-
served water molecules generally have more protein atom
neighbors, a more hydrophilic environment and hydrogen
bonds to the proteins, making them less mobile (Sanschagrin
and Kuhn, 1998). Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
class 1 proteins have three highly conserved water molecules,
which are believed to be involved in stabilizing the twisted )3-
turn, modulating peptide recognition and determining the pos-
ition of N—terminal segment of the 0:2 helix (Ogata and Wodak,
2002). Cluster analysis of water molecules in alanine racemase
reveals the consensus water sites in the active site and at the
interface of two monomers, where they play a structural role in
maintaining and stabilizing the alanine racemase dimer (Mustata
and Briggs, 2004). By a similar method, Loris et a]. identiﬁed
conserved waters in a large family of microbial ribonucleases
RNase T1 and in legume lectin crystal structures (Loris et al.,
1994, 1999). Using deuterium exchange mass spectroscopy and
molecular dynamics simulations, Teze et a]. predicted conserved
water molecules channels to be probably involved in the function
of family 1 glycosidases (Teze et al., 2013).

As the importance of conserved water molecules is generally
accepted, a simple and rapid tool for their identiﬁcation in pro-
tein structures is desirable before structural bioinformatics stu-
dies are performed. Up to now two tools are available:
Sanschagrin and Kuhn presented a command line tool called
WatCH (Sanschagrin and Kuhn, 1998) and C. A. Bottoms et
al. described a semiautomated method to identify conserved solv-
ent sites and studied conserved waters in six protein families
(Bottoms et al., 2006). No other comprehensive open-source
tools with a graphical user interface (GUI) are available for
such kind of analyses. Here, we present a tool, PyWATER,
with an intuitive graphical user interface that can be seamlessly
integrated into PyMOL (http://sourceforge.net/projects/pymol),
including all important steps that are crucial for identifying the
conserved water molecules.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

PyWATER is written in python and depends on the scipy and
the numpy modules. At ﬁrst, the high resolution 3D protein
structures, determined by X-ray crystallography, which are

similar to a query structure, are retrieved and superimposed onto
the query structure to identify the consensus water molecules in
most of the structures. The protein data bank (PDB) identiﬁers
of these structures are obtained by an XML query using the
RESTful web services of PDB (Bernstein et al., 1977), which
weekly clusters data of protein chains by BlastClust (Altschul
et al., 1990) with different sequence identity cutoffs. By default,
PyWATER uses 95% sequence identity cutoff. The threshold
can be further adjusted by the user. PDB structure ﬁles for all
sequences in the same cluster are fetched from the PDB.

Then the quality of an overall crystal structure is assessed by
its resolution. By default, only structures with 52.0A resolution
are selected. Users can further modify the resolution cutoff. The
tool also accepts a user-deﬁned list of pdb chains to superimpose.
In such case, it bypasses the retrieval of pdb clusters data and
ﬁltering by resolution cutoff. Further, the quality of water reﬁne-
ment in a crystal structure is assessed by mobility or normalized
B-factor (Buerger, 1960). Based on either one of these two cri-
teria, water molecules are ﬁltered. Mobility reﬂects the crystallo-
graphic temperature factor (B-factor) and the occupancy. From
each structure, water oxygen atoms with mobility values 32.0 are
discarded (Sanschagrin and Kuhn, 1998).

Bi/(B)
Oi/(O)

 

M ability,- =

Normalized B-factor is calculated as (Carugo, 1999):

Bi — (3)

Normalized B — factor,- = W

In the equations above, B is the temperature factor and O is the
occupancy of all atoms of a protein crystal structure.

From each structure, water oxygen atoms having normalized
B-factor 31.0 are also neglected. In case >50% of the water
molecules are discarded by mobility or normalized B-factors
ﬁlter, the whole PDB structure is not considered for further cal-
culation and filtered out. The user can also deselect this ﬁlter step
by choosing ‘No Refinement’ in the drop-down list.

The selected crystal structures are superimposed using the
backbone as reference to bring all the structures in the same
frame as the query protein structure. Then, hierarchical cluster-
ing is performed on the 3D Cartesian coordinates of all the water
molecules from the superimposed structures. For this step eucli-
dean distance metric to calculate distances between 3D Cartesian
coordinates and by default, the complete linkage algorithm are
used, aiming to form ﬂat clusters by the inconsistency method
with a cutoff of 2.4 For this hierarchical clustering, the fclus-
terdata method of scipy.cluster.hierarchy python module is used.
The inconsistency cutoff threshold of 2.4A ensures that at most,
only one water molecule from each superimposed structure is
present in the cluster. For each cluster, the degree of conserva-
tion is calculated. The degree of conservation of water molecule
is calculated as the number of water molecules in a cluster
divided by the total number of structures superimposed for
water clustering. Clusters having a degree of conservation of
>0.7 were considered as conserved. This default cutoff can also
be changed by the user.

The query protein structure is saved in the PDB file format
with only conserved water molecules. Optionally the user can

water molecules. W6 and W7 are predicted, in addition to known W1,
W2, W3, W4 and W5, which are important in ligand binding site (Lucas
et al., 2013)

save the superimposed structures used for the clustering analysis.
As a result, a PyMOL session is presented showing conserved
water molecules with all the hydrogen bonds formed by them.
All conserved water molecules are colored according to their
degree of conservation. A log file with all input parameters, pro-
gram messages, warnings and errors is saved. An additional file is
generated showing the degree of conservation of each cluster
with related atom numbers of water oxygen atoms from the
superimposed protein structures. These data are useful to statis-
tically analyze the conserved water molecules in more detail, to
manipulate the input parameters or to analyze side chains in
close contact.

3 USAGE

PyWATER can be executed from the command line or used as
PyMOL plug-in with a GUI. It can be installed in PyMOL, as a
plug-in, by choosing ‘Install’ under ‘Manage Plugins’ under the
‘Plugin’ menu in PyMOL Tcl-Tk GUI and then selecting the
‘pywater.py’ ﬁle.

4 VALIDATION

PyWATER was validated on previously studied proteins such as
thrombin, trypsin, BPTI (Sanschagrin and Kuhn, 1998) and bro-
modomain-containing protein 4 (Lucas et al., 2013).
Furthermore, protein families such as MHC class I proteins
(Ogata and Wodak, 2002) and class A ﬂ-lactamases (Bos and
Pleiss, 2008) were analyzed. PyWATER identiﬁed all water mol-
ecules as discussed by the authors. Figure 1 shows an example of
a PyWATER run with PDB entry 4LYW chain A.

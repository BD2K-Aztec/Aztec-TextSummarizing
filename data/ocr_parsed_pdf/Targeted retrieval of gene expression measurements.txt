ABSTRACT

Motivation: Large public repositories of gene expression measure-
ments offer the opportunity to position a new experiment into the
context of earlier studies. While previous methods rely on experimen-
tal annotation or global similarity of expression profiles across
genes or gene sets, we compare experiments by measuring similarity
based on an unsupervised, data-driven regulatory model around
pre-specified genes of interest. Our experiment retrieval approach is
novel in two conceptual respects: (i) targetable focus and interpret-
ability: the analysis is targeted at regulatory relationships of genes that
are relevant to the analyst or come from prior knowledge; (ii) regulatory
model-based similarity measure: related experiments are retrieved
based on the strength of inferred regulatory links between genes.
Results: We learn a model for the regulation of specific genes from a
data repository and exploit it to construct a similarity metric for an
information retrieval task. We use the Fisher kernel, a rigorous similar-
ity measure that typically has been applied to use generative models in
discriminative classifiers. Results on human and plant microarray
collections indicate that our method is able to substantially improve
the retrieval of related experiments against standard methods.
Furthermore, it allows the user to interpret biological conditions in
terms of changes in link activity patterns. Our study of the osmotic
stress network for Arabidopsis thaliana shows that the method suc-
cessfully identifies relevant relationships around given key genes.

1 INTRODUCTION

Considerable effort has been spent on collecting gene expression
measurements into huge public repositories. This has opened up
the door to large-scale comparisons and meta-analysis of data

from different experiments. A crucial question is how to ﬁnd
datasets that are biologically relevant for a certain phenomenon
under study. The common way to obtain relevant data from
repositories is keyword search (for instance, Zhu et al., 2008);
however, the reliability and usefulness of this approach fully
depend on the availability and quality of data annotation, and
on the existence of good standardized keywords. Therefore,
content-based retrieval methods have received attention recently.
In addition to detecting other relevant datasets, such methods
can assist in automatic prediction of annotations and in discover-
ing previously unknown relationships between different biolo-
gical conditions.

Previous data-driven approaches for relating gene expression
profiles can be grouped by two criteria: the representation of
gene expression profiles and the similarity measure for compar-
ing proﬁles. Regarding the representation, there exist three
common alternatives: (i) activity proﬁles over genes, often differ-
ential rather than absolute values if control measurements are
available, or simply rankings of genes (Engreitz et al., 2010;
Fujibuchi et al., 2007; Le et al., 2010); (ii) activity proﬁles over
known gene sets (also called pathways or signatures; Caldas
et al., 2009, 2012; Huttenhower and Troyanskaya, 2008; Segal
et al., 2004) and (iii) activity profiles over gene modules predicted
from other data sources (e.g. proteiniprotein interactions;
Suthram et al., 2010). The most widely used similarity measures
are Pearson and Spearman correlation (Engreitz et al., 2010;
Fujibuchi et al., 2007); other search tools take signatures of
up- and down-regulated genes as a query and compute
rank-based scores against the measurements in a database
(Feng et al., 2009); neither approach is ﬁtted in any way to the
database.

In contrast, several approaches derive features from the data-
base or learn a model of it; the results are then used when com-
puting the similarity of the query to database entries. In the
simplest case, variances of gene or gene set activity values are
determined from the data compendium, and then exploited for
calculating a weighted correlation coefﬁcient (Engreitz et al.,
2010; Le et al., 2010); beyond that, one can apply dimensionality
reduction techniques to learn low-dimensional feature spaces
that represent the data appropriately (Engreitz et al., 2010).

latent variable models that inherently yield probabilistic similar-
ity measures between gene expression proﬁles. In addition to
these purely unsupervised methods, also supervised approaches
have been proposed to relate gene expression experiments with
each other (Huang et al., 2010; Huttenhower and Troyanskaya,
2008).

The novelty of our approach lies in the fact that the model
learned from the data compendium focuses on inferring the local
regulatory network neighborhood of speciﬁc user-deﬁned genes
of interest. As a well-deﬁned and intuitive model-based retrieval
criterion, we use the Fisher kernel (FK) (Jaakkola and Haussler,
1999), which derives a similarity measure between data points
from a generative model. Consequently, the comparison of bio-
logical samples is based on the differential activity of particular
cellular processes only. The alternative of using global transcrip-
tomic models and hence global similarities between data would
easily obscure the interesting local processes shared between
measurements. The alternative of using known ontologies, on
the other hand, would miss unknown regulatory patterns. In
practice, the user can focus the modeling by providing known
key genes involved in the biological process under study or genes
whose connection to known pathways and experimental condi-
tions is yet unclear.

Our model-driven targeted retrieval approach is intended
to complement earlier tools for experiment retrieval targeted
by query genes: Parkinson et a]. (2009) retrieve experiments
where the query genes are differentially expressed, Hibbs et a].
(2007) retrieve datasets where the query genes are correlated,
and Greene and Troyanskaya (2011) identify experimental
conditions discriminating positive and negative query genes. As
our approach models relationships of biological samples with
respect to only a subset of genes, it shares some aspects
with bicluster detection methods, which are very popular in
gene expression analysis (Madeira and Oliveira, 2004);
deﬁning genes of interest and a query sample can be seen as
providing a seed bicluster. However, in contrast to bicluster
approaches, we bring the structure of gene networks into the
similarity criterion. A related approach has been proposed by
Lahti et a]. (2010), but it assumes a given network whereas we
infer the network around the target genes. Furthermore, none of
the earlier biclustering—type approaches has been designed for
retrieval.

In a nutshell, our approach consists of the following compo-
nents, which will be described in detail in Section 2. First, a
regulatory model of gene expression is learned from the data-
base; to allow for more user interaction and better individual
interpretability, the model focuses on relationships around
user-deﬁned genes of interest; here, we use a set of local depend-
ency models learned by sparse linear regression as a simple regu-
latory model (Meinshausen and Buhlmann, 2006). Second, the
model serves as a basis for comparing measurements: given a
query measurement, the method ranks the measurements in the
repository according to a model-based similarity criterion, here a
variant of the FK (Jaakkola and Haussler, 1999; Shawe-Taylor
and Cristianini, 2004). In Section 3, we show the effectiveness of
our approach in a leukemia case study with a human microarray
compendium and in an osmotic stress study with a collection of
plant stress datasets. Section 4 discusses the work and describes
future extensions.

2 METHODS FOR TARGETED COMPARISON OF
GENE EXPRESSION MEASUREMENTS

Our approach for comparing gene expression measurements consists of
two main steps: (i) learning a conditional expression model for a given
target gene list, using a large data compendium and (ii) computing Fisher
soore similarities between measurements based on the model. In the fol-
lowing, we describe the steps in detail.

2.1 Targeted gene expression model

Our goal is to build a model for the expression of target genes, condi-
tioned on the expression of other genes. Let us ﬁrst introduce some
notation. The X = (X 1, . . . , X 1,) is a p-dimensional random variable
that represents the gene expression proﬁle, where p is the total number
of genes. Let T C {1, . . . ,p} be the set of target gene indices and —T
the set of all the remaining gene indices ({1,...,p}\T). Then, X7
denotes the variable X limited to the subspace deﬁned by T.
Furthermore, let X be the data matrix, containing in row i the i-th real-
ization of X, which is denoted by x03 = (x9, . . . , x59), 1 5 i 5 n. We are
interested in modeling the expression values of the target genes given the
expression values of the remaining genes, that is, modeling of the distri-
bution P(X7|X,7). One prominent formalism for modeling conditional
independence relationships between variables is Gaussian graphical
models (GGMs), introduced by Dempster (1972); see Dobra et a].
(2004) and Markowetz and Spang (2007) for the use of GGMs in gene
network reconstruction. In that context, estimating the model structure is
challenging due to the ‘small n, large [7’ problem. A common approxima-
tion is to estimate the neighbors of each gene separately and combine
these estimates into a so-called dependency network (Heckerman et al.,
2001).

We use a local dependency network composed of individual neigh-
borhood estimates for each target gene j e T. Each neighborhood esti-
mate is obtained by learning a Gaussian linear model (see, e.g. Alpaydin,
2010)

A/jZXLUHE-I-E, 8~N(0,02), 

where ,8 is a weight vector and 02 the variance of the Gaussian noise; the
variables X1,. . .,Xp are assumed to have been standardized to mean 0 and
unit variance, and hence we need not consider an intercept term. In
high-dimensional settings, it is desirable to obtain sparse estimates for
,8, i.e. solutions where most entries are 0. The variables corresponding to
non-zero entries build the ‘neighbor set’ of the j-th variable, written as

NU)={kE{1,---,I7}\{1'}Iﬁind(k)¢0}- (2)

Here, ind(k) indicates the position of ,8 that is mapped to the variable X k.
Sparse coefﬁcient estimates are achieved by applying Ll-norm regulariza-
tion or Lasso (Tibshirani, 1996), yielding the following solution:

1%: argrrgnwlnxj -X4m/5||§ +AII/5II1)- (3)

Meinshausen and Bﬁhlmann (2006) provide an analytical choice for
the penalty parameter A that guarantees asymptotically consistent neigh-
borhood estimates for sparse high-dimensional graphs. All results re-
ported in this article use the analytical A-value, with the constant or
(bounding the probability of falsely joining two connectivity components)
ﬁxed to 0.05, as in the original article and in Schafer and Strimmer (2005);
it yielded sparser solutions than the A-value chosen by cross-validation.

To obtain a model for the whole set of target genes, we simply con-
catenate the gene-speciﬁc models, treating them as independent. This is a
widely used model approximation strategy, based on the so-called ‘pseu-
do-likelihood’ (Ambroise et al., 2009; Besag, 1975; Schmidt et al., 2008);
the pseudo-likelihood regarding a speciﬁc data point x“) is given by

For compactness, we write in the following [Xe-mm) instead of
P(xj(.')|x(:)w; 61-). Here, 8, denotes the parameters of the j-th independent
submodel, in our case consisting of the coefﬁcient vector ,8(/) and the
variance 0,2. The likelihood of a submodel with respect to the i-th data
point is calculated as follows:

2.2 Model-based similarity measure

Having learned a model for the expression of target genes, we exploit it
for deﬁning the similarity between gene expression proﬁles. For that pur-
pose, we represent each expression proﬁle (data point) by its Fisher score
with respect to the model; the score is deﬁned as the gradient of the
log-likelihood for the proﬁle 7 with respect to the parameters 7 at the
learned values of the parameters (Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini, 2004). In
our modeling setup, each submodel has its own parameters, and by con-
catenating the gradients of all submodels, we obtain a gradient of the
global pseudo-log-likelihood. The parameters of biological interest in
each submodel are the weight coefﬁcients for the neighbors of the re-
spective target gene; we ignore the derivative regarding the noise param-
eter of, because the noise is assumed to be independent of the biological
condition. The partial derivative of the log-likelihood with respect to
,8,nd(,,(/j amounts to

310g£(9';x®) 1 (i) (z) (i) (o
(1)] =2 ’9' _ Z ﬁindacﬂk ’9 - (5)
3:81am) 1' keNo)

Concatenating these partial derivatives yields the Fisher score representa-
tion of the i-th data point, written as sé(x(’)), where 8 denotes the esti-
mated parameters of the overall model, which here are the Ll-regularized
maximum-likelihood estimates for ,8. The inner product in this new fea-
ture space is a model-dependent similarity measure K9, also called the
simple Fisher kernel (FK) (Jaakkola and Haussler, 1999; Shawe-Taylor
and Cristianini, 2004):

Ké(x(il), x(i2)) = Sé(x(il))TSé(x(I-2))- (6)

To understand this measure, recall that the gradient of a function is suf-
ﬁcient for determining its ﬁrst-order Taylor series approximation. In our
case, the function is the (pseudo-)log-likelihood of the model. Its
ﬁrst-order Taylor series approximation evaluated at 8 is

log [19; x0?) x log t:(é; x9) + (v log [19; x<0))é(e — é), (7)

where (V log £(6; x03)»; denotes the gradient of the log-likelihood for x03
at 8 and the 8 are the (maximum-likelihood) parameter estimates ob-
tained on some training dataset D 7 not necessarily the ones maximizing
the likelihood when a new data point x03 is added to the dataset. Since the
approximation is exact in the close neighborhood of 8, the gradient
(Vlog £(6; x(i)))é, which is identical to the Fisher score sé(x(’)), indicates
the direction in which to update the parameters in order to maximize the
log-likelihood for x“), starting from the current parameters 8.

Hence, we get a parameter update for the extended dataset D + x01) by
gradient ascent

éncwxm) : é+dsé(x(il)), 

where d is a suitably small step size. In the same way, we obtain an
updated parameter estimate éncwxuz) for D + x62). As the model param-
eters constitute the summary statistics of the dataset under the assump-
tions of the model, comparing éncwxu') and éncwxuz) is sufﬁcient for
comparing the datasets D +x(il) and D +x(il). This is a well-deﬁned
way for doing a model-based comparison of two different data points

x01) and x02) if D is the dataset from which the model has been learned.
Furthermore, the informative part here is the comparison between
.sé(x(il)) and .sé(x(il)), ignoring the step size (Shawe-Taylor and
Cristianini, 2004).

In terms of differential geometry, the proper metric for comparing
models on the Riemannian manifold of the model class is the Fisher
information metric. The steepest ascent locally along the manifold is
the natural gradient J’1.sé(x(i')), where J is the Fisher information
matrix. Replacing the gradient .sé(x(i')) in Equation (8) by the natural
gradient and applying the metric, we obtain a kernel that is proportional
to .sé(x(i'))TJ’1.sé(x(il)) (Jaakkola and Haussler, 1999). The simpler kernel
.sé(x(i'))7.sé(x(il)) is a suitable approximation (Jaakkola and Haussler,
1999) that makes the computation much more efﬁcient.

In summary, the inner product between the Fisher scores of two dif-
ferent data points x01) and x62) is an approximate measure for the simi-
larity of the resulting datasets, from the model’s point of View, when
adding either x01) or x62) to the data. In our case, we compare the
Fisher scores with respect to the ,8 coefﬁcients, which indicate the strength
and the sign of gene relationships (i.e. whether the co-regulation is in the
same direction or in opposite directions). In retrieval, which is the pri-
mary application in this article, this similarity criterion is used to compare
a new measurement proﬁle against all previous ones, which results in a
ranked list of the measurements available in the database. The underlying
model is learned based on the whole database and does not require any
experimental annotation. The retrieval is computationally inexpensive
because the gene-speciﬁc submodels as well as the corresponding scores
can be pre-computed ofﬂine on the data compendium. At query time, we
only have to compute the scores of the query and then compute inner
products between the query scores and previous measurement scores,
where only scores of submodels for genes speciﬁed in the user-given
target list are considered. These operations require 0(Kjll) time, where
K is the number of non-zero coefﬁcients in the model and M is the
number of measurements in the database.

3 RESULTS

We applied our method in two case studies: human leukemia and
plant stress. We show that targeted expression models are not
only able to enhance the retrieval of related measurements but
also allow for interpretation of underlying biological processes in
terms of networks and network activation patterns. Prior know-
ledge in the form of key genes is taken into account, and relevant
relationships (putative network neighbors) of the genes are
inferred directly from the data.

3.1 Leukemia case study

For a proof-of—principle study of the new method’s performance,
we used a large compendium of human microarrays (Lukk et al.,
2010); it consists of 5372 measurements from different cell types
tissue types and disease states, which have been collected from
206 different studies, all based on the same microarray platform
(Affymetrix U133A). A subset of 567 samples from 15 studies are
labeled as leukemia (according to the ‘15 metagroups’ annota-
tion). We tested the performance of the model-based method for
the task of retrieval of relevant experiments (REx) by 5-fold
cross-validation, where one-ﬁfth of the leukemia samples were
excluded from the model training and then taken as queries. The
model was learned from the remaining leukemia samples and
all non-leukemia samples, without using the label information.
The ranked retrieval results were evaluated based on the given
annotation (leukemia versus non-leukemia). The precision of the

top-k results of a query is given by the fraction of leukemia
samples among the ﬁrst k samples.

As targets, we chose eight genes that are known to play a role
in leukemia: BCR, ETV6, FLT3, HOXA9, MYST3, PRDM2,
RUNXl and TALl. They were also reported as being differen-
tially expressed in the 567 leukemia samples (among a list of 243
genes; Lukk et al., 2010). This preselection might give a positive
bias to the precision values, which we controlled by testing
whether this set of target genes would be a good biomarker for
discriminating leukemia samples against non-leukemia samples.
We observed that baseline approaches (Pearson correlation,
Euclidean distance) restricted to this set of genes are clearly in-
ferior to REx in the cross-validation performance (Table 1; rows
1, 7 and 8), and hence REx has a competitive advantage here.

We tested two variants of REx: the first one learned the ex-
pression model by choosing predictors from among all the other
genes of the total set of 13 262 measured genes; the second took
only the other target genes into account. Interestingly, the second
variant is only slightly worse than the first at the high precision
end (topl and top5 results), and it is even better than the first
when looking at more than five retrieval results (Table 1; rows 1
and 2). This indicates that already the relationships among the
eight target genes (i.e. at most 56 links) are sufﬁcient for almost
perfect retrieval performance. Both variants of REx achieved an
enormous dimensionality reduction compared with the baseline
methods that use all genes (the first REx variant used on average
351.4 links, the second 44.4); in addition to increasing the bio-
logical interpretability, REx led to the best retrieval results
(Table 1; rows 1, 2, 5 and 6).

Finally, we benchmarked the FK similarity used in REx
against the simpler baseline similarity criteria (Pearson correl-
ation, Euclidean distance) when controlling the dimensionality
of data representations to be equal. For that purpose, we con-
structed hybrid approaches that take the predictor genes from
the learned expression model and then compute Pearson correl-
ation or Euclidean distance on their expression values. The simi-
larity criterion of REx, which considers modeled relationships
between predictor genes and target genes, achieved better results
in the retrieval task (Table 1; rows 1, 3 and 4). Variances across
the 567 queries were generally high, but with REx they were
lower than with the other methods. For instance, at the top100

results, REx had slightly lower average precision, but also lower
variance than the hybrid method with Pearson correlation, which
had the best average precision at that level.

3.2 Plant stress case study

Besides being efﬁcient and effective in finding relevant data, re-
trieval by targeted models can assist in analyzing molecular path-
ways related to speciﬁc biological processes. Here, we present a
study on osmotic stress regulation in Arabidopsis thaliana.

3.2.] Data Collection, preprocessing and annotation We
downloaded 38 raw Affymetrix ATH1 datasets from
NASCArrays, (http: //affymetrix.arabidopsis .info/narrays/experi
mentbrowse.pl) ArrayExpress (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/microarray-
as/ae/), Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih
.gov/geo/), and The Integrated Microarray Database System
(http://ausubellab.mgh.harvard.edu/imds). All measurements
were related to stress conditions in A.thaliana. By applying stand-
ard preprocessing methods, we obtained 141 differential expres-
sion proﬁles across 6658 differentially expressed genes (see
Supplementary Material for detailed information about the
data and preprocessing). Each profile was manually annotated
with respect to 24 binary stress-related attributes.

3.2.2 Retrieval of osmotic stress measurements One widely
studied type of plant stress is osmotic stress, which relates to
dehydration of the plant caused by environmental conditions
such as drought, high salt concentration or cold (Boudsocq
and Lauriere, 2005). The transcription factor DREB2A has
been found to play a central role in osmotic stress response in
A.thaliana; it interacts with a dehydration-responsive element
(DRE). Sakuma et al. (2006) experimentally induced overexpres-
sion of a constitutively active form of DREB2A and published a
list of 36 genes that responded with expression changes greater
than eight times, relative to control plants. We refer to this list,
together with DREB2A, as ‘Sakuma-all’ later on. Note that the
underlying experiment is not included in the data compendium
we use in our analysis. Nine out of these strongly overexpressed
genes are annotated as water-stress-related and have a DRE
element in the upstream region. We call this list, with the add-
ition of DREB2A, ‘Sakuma-water’. Moreover, we downloaded
from STIFDB (http://caps.ncbs.res.in/stifdb/browse.html#se)

Model-based targeted retrieval of gene expression measurements

 

(Shameer et al., 2009) a list of 41 genes annotated as ‘drought—
salt-cold’, which originally has been derived by integrating vari-
ous microarray datasets. This list is named ‘STIFDB’ hereafter.
‘Sakuma-all’ and ‘STIFDB’ share only four genes, since
DREB2A is not activated by cold stress.

Our data collection contained 31 osmotic stress samples from
ﬁve different datasets (comprising at least six samples). We inves-
tigated the retrieval performance of REx by cross-validation in a
leave-one-dataset-out manner, using the same six comparison
methods as in the leukemia case above. Figure 1 shows the re-
sulting precision7recall curves for the three different lists of input
genes: Sakuma-water, Sakuma-all and STIFDB. In all cases,
REx performs better than the baseline methods. The best re-
trieval results are obtained with Sakuma-water and REx, closely
followed by the REx variant restricted to only operate on the
target genes; the top false positives are shown in the
Supplementary Material. For the other two gene lists, restricting
the REx model only to predictors among the target genes was
actually beneﬁcial for the retrieval. One possible reason for this
observation is that these lists are larger than Sakuma-water and
thereby can already explain by themselves the expression of some
central target genes sufﬁciently well, whereas less relevant exter-
nal predictors can decrease the performance. Next, we take a
closer look at the osmotic stress network learned around
Sakuma-water targets.

3.2.3 Analysis of osmotic stress gene network The REx
method extracted 29 additional genes with putative relationships
to genes in Sakuma-water; they form three networks which we
refer to as DREB2A, RD29A and AT2G46140 after the central
target of each network (Fig. 2). Target genes are depicted as
boxes. Arrows go from putative predictors to targets; they do
not indicate regulatory relationships. Only one negative (i.e. sup-
pressive) gene relationship was found (dashed edge). Black edges
indicate relationships that are strengthened in osmotic stress rela-
tive to the base model (i.e. the corresponding coefﬁcients move
further away from zero in >75% of the osmotic stress samples).
The remaining, gray edges mark relationships with larger
heterogeneity.

Figure 3 provides an overall View of the expression changes
across all datasets in terms of model-based Fisher scores with
respect to the three networks. The RD29A network is the largest
of the three networks; it is activated by drought and osmotic
stresses, by cold stress (which has an osmotic stress component),
and by the plant hormone abscisic acid, also a regulator of abi-
otic stress. The DREB2A network shows some osmotic stress
regulation and regulation by UV-B radiation. Closer inspection
of the genes in this network indicated that they could be part of
the plant heat shock response. We validated this hypothesis
against an independent dataset containing a time course heat
shock experiment (Supplementary Fig. S2). Indeed, the genes
showed rapid expression response to heat shock. The role of
DREB2A as regulator in osmotic stress and heat shock response
is well established Woshida et al., 2008). The smallest network,
centered around AT2G46140, is a novel finding suggesting that
DREB2A and some of its targets also have a role in responses to
pathogen infection and pathogen elicitors.

We checked the significance of the inferred gene relationships
in a bootstrapping experiment (see Supplementary Material).

The most prevalent relationships were well supported by func-
tional annotations. In addition, concordant expression between
the transcription factor DREB2A and the predictors
AT3G62260 and ZAT12 was validated in two independent data-
sets, giving rise to interesting biological hypotheses (see
Supplementary Material). While further experimental studies
are needed to untangle regulatory mechanisms of stress genes,
our results show that the relationships discovered by REx are
relevant in recognizing osmotic stress conditions.

3.2.4 Smallest discriminative set of target genes In Figure 1,
we observed that the list of targets (Sakuma-water) is more dis-
criminative on our data compendium than the larger lists
Sakuma-all and STIFDB. Next, we were interested whether
even smaller lists of target genes have discriminative power.
For that purpose, we tested the retrieval performance with
reduced versions of Sakuma-water. More speciﬁcally, for given
sizes of the target list, we used cross-validation on the training set
to choose the best subset of Sakuma-water satisfying the size
constraint, where the quality criterion was average precision
(across the whole recall range). This best subset was used to
learn a model with all training data, which was then tested on
left-out test data. Training and test data were deﬁned by
cross-validation in exactly the same way as for Figure 1.
Supplementary Figure S4a shows the precision7recall curves ob-
tained on the test data (averaged across all queries) for different
sizes of the target list. Target lists of size 3 outperformed the ori-
ginal target list of size 10. The exact composition of the subset
differed between the cross-validation folds, but only the follow-
ing genes occurred (in decreasing order): RD29A, LEA7,
COR15A, AT3G17520 and LSR3. Remarkably, a model with
a single target gene performed very well, except in the top pre-
cision region. In all cases, RD29A was the selected gene (respon-
sive to dehydration). However, while selected subsets of targets
can be very powerful, on average the retrieval performance de-
creases monotonically when reducing the size of the target list
(Supplementary. Fig. S4b).

3.2.5 Robustness against nuisance target genes A further
question is whether errors in the target list are harmful for the
retrieval. To study this, we added randomly picked genes to
Sakuma-water; they were chosen among the other 6648 genes
(genes showing only minor differential expression in all datasets
were removed in the preprocessing). We did 50 repeats on each
number of additional genes. Supplementary Figure S4c shows
the average retrieval performance. As expected, a larger
number of added random genes led to a stronger decrease in
precision. However, the change was not very dramatic, implying
that a reasonable number of unrelated genes can be tolerated
quite well as long as the target list contains also discriminative
genes.

4 DISCUSSION

We introduced a novel approach for targeted model-based re-
trieval of gene expression measurements. The model we proposed
is suitable for efﬁcient retrieval; due to the decomposition into
gene-speciﬁc submodels, learning can be done ofﬂine, prior to
the queries. Although we used L1-regularized regression to learn

a simple regulatory model in this work, the approach is not
limited to a speciﬁc type of probabilistic models. For instance,
it is straightforward to use the elastic net approach (Zou and
Hastie, 2005), and it is also possible to exploit additional data
(e.g. protein7protein interactions) or prior knowledge during
learning. If the user-speciﬁed genes are modeled jointly (e.g. by
common predictors), more computational effort is required at
query time; alternatively, the model may be provided directly
by the user. In contrast to condition-speciﬁc regulatory models
(Shimamura et al., 2010; Zhang and Wang, 2010), our method
does not rely on annotation of samples. The current modeling
approach requires that data are comparable. To apply it in
cross-platform analysis, previous methods to achieve compar-
ability can be used (Stafford and Brun, 2007). An interesting
direction for future work is retrieval across different platforms
or species using an integrated model.

Besides allowing for unsupervised data-based retrieval of
related measurements, the proposed method assists in investigat-
ing relationships among genes. As illustrated in the osmotic
stress example, measurements with curated annotation can help
to assess the quality of models and to detect condition-dependent

activity changes. When applying targeted modeling, an import-
ant question is how to choose the target list for a biological
process of interest. If it is too narrow, it might not have sufﬁcient
discriminative power; if it is too wide, the performance might
suffer due to irrelevant genes. The retrieval framework allows
the user to check different possibilities and to interactively im-
prove the target list for her purposes. It also makes possible
exploration of the types of retrieval results a particular target
list yields, exploiting different kinds of annotations that are avail-
able for the database content. This can be useful if the user is
interested in speciﬁc genes, but uncertain about the processes
they are involved in. Finally, the targeted modeling and retrieval
approach can be a useful analysis tool also for other omics-type
high-throughput data.

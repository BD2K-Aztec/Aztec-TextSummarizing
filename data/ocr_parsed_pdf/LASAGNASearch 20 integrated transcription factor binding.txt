annotation for one sequence from either a TFigene interaction
or gene expression experiment. Hence, binding sites of a TF can
be extracted from TFigene interaction records in the PAZAR
projects. As more than one project may curate binding sites of a
particular TF, we aggregated records containing TFigene inter—
action information from all the public projects. All the ﬁles in the
general feature format dated 20120117 were downloaded. We
group TFBSs by TF and species, that is, human TF A and
mouse TF A are considered two TFs.

A binding site was filtered out if it is <4 or >1000 bases long.
To verify a binding site, we searched for it in the vicinity of the
curated genomic location in the reference genome. The binding
site was discarded if it could not be located within five bases of
the curated location. As we collected binding sites for a TF
across all the public projects in PAZAR, a TFBS may be curated
by more than one project, resulting in multiple copies of the
TFBS in our collection. Therefore, for each pair of overlapping
binding sites, we kept only the shorter one if the overlap is >80%
of the shorter one in length. A model was built for a TF if it has
at least 10 binding sites.

The LASAGNA—ChIP algorithm (Lee and Huang, 2013a) was
used to align the binding sites of a TF because some of the pro—
jects contain TFBSs identified by ChIP—seq and ChIP—chip ex—
periments. As reported by Johnson et a]. (2007), about 94% of
the actual binding sites can be located within 50 bases of signal
peaks. However, no clipping was done for sequences produced
by ChIP—seq experiments because information about the signal
peak is not available in PAZAR. The new collection contains 66
TF models, 39, 20 and 7 of which are human, mouse and rat,
respectively.

2.2 Support for more species

The initial release of LASAGNA—Search 2.0 supports seven spe—
cies for automatic promoter sequence retrieval and visualization
in the UCSC genome browser. This is an important feature be—
cause the genomic locations of sequences retrieved by
LASAGNA—Search are available. The genomic locations of
user—supplied sequences in the FASTA format, however, are
unknown. Consequently, putative binding sites found in user—
supplied sequences can only be visualized locally at
LASAGNA—Search not in the UCSC genome browser. To
make LASAGNA—Search more useful, we have added support
for eight additional species since the initial release. The newly
added species are Bos taurus, Sus scrofa, Ovis dries, Gallus gallus,
Cam's lupus familiaris, Felis catus, Xenopus (Silurana) tropicalis
and Danio rerio. More importantly, we have automated adding
support for a new species. As long as information about tran—
scription start sites is available in the UCSC genome browser
database, a new species can be added with ease. Hence, we en—
courage users to request for new species to meet their research or
teaching need.

2.3 Hardware and user interface

LASAGNA—Search was initially deployed on a shared web
server. To better serve the users, LASAGNA—Search 2.0 is now
powered by a cluster with a load balancer to direct incoming
trafflc, making it more scalable. This enabled us to add more
options to retrieve longer promoter sequences, which were

capped at 1000 bps because of limited computation capacity.
To make TF model selection easier, the model information
page with a sequence logo does not need to be opened in a
new tab. It can now be displayed when mouse pointer hovers
over. To visualize hits locally, LASAGNA—Search displays only
the region of promoter from the first hit to the last hit. An option
has been added to display the entire promoter, and hence, the
saved images are aligned by transcription start sites.

3 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTION

LASAGNA—Search 2.0 was designed to be a user—friendly and
an easy—to—use webtool for TFBS search and visualization.
Users do not need to be bioinformaticians and can start
using the tool immediately. Besides research, LASAGNA—
Search 2.0 is well—suited for teaching and class projects at the
undergraduate level, where students have limited experience in
programming. To keep the tool useful, we plan to include
support for species on users’ request and keep the TF model
collections up—to—date by incorporating new database releases
such as JASPAR 2014 (Mathelier et al., 2013). To easily use
ChIP—seq data, we plan to interface with a genomic cloud com—
puting platform such as the Illumina BaseSpace. This way users
can easily use motifs discovered in ChIP—seq experiments of one
species to scan sequences of another species. A genomic cloud
computing platform allows users to perform computation—
intensive analyses in a browser, which is in line with
LASAGNA—Search.

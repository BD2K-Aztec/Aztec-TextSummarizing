prior design methodologies were relatively modest, MIPgen
scores enable stratification of MIP targets a priori and in silico
with reasonable discriminatory power. In the future, MIP scor—
ing may be calibrated with new training sets that can account for
advances in MIP protocols or match more specialized conditions
that entail DNA of variable concentration or quality. Curated
MIP/smMIP designs per gene may be indicated to facilitate com—
parison across studies and improve access to validated MIP/
smMIP assays, and surveying MIPgen scores prior to commit—
ting to a MIP target may serve to maximize the economy of a
MIP target enrichment approach. More generally, we anticipate
that the user—friendly package for MIP and smMIP design pro—
vided in the MIPgen package will facilitate its broader use in
both research and clinical applications.

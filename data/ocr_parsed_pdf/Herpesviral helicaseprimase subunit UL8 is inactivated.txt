ABSTRACT

Motivation: Herpesviruses are large DNA viruses causing a variety of
diseases in humans and animals. To develop effective treatment, it is
important to understand the mechanisms of their replication. One of
the components of the herpesviral DNA replication system is a heli-
case—primase complex, consisting of UL5 (helicase), UL52 (primase)
and UL8. UL8 is an essential herpesviral protein involved in multiple
protein—protein interactions. Intriguingly, so far no UL8 homologs out-
side of herpesviruses could be identified. Moreover, nothing is known
about its structure or domain organization.

Results: Here, combining sensitive homology detection methods and
homology modeling, we found that the UL8 protein family is related to
B-family polymerases. In the course of evolution, UL8 has lost the
active site and has undergone a reduction of DNA-binding motifs.
The loss of active site residues explains the failure to detect any cata-
lytic activity of UL8. A structural model of human herpes virus 1 UL8
constructed as part of the study is consistent with the mutation data
targeting its interaction with primase UL52. It also provides a platform
for studying multiple interactions that UL8 is involved in. The two other
components of helicase—primase complex show evolutionary links
with a newly characterized human primase that also has DNA poly-
merase activity (PrimPol) and the Pif1 helicase, respectively. The role
of these enzymes in recovering stalled replication forks suggests
mechanistic and functional similarities with herpesviral proteins.

1 INTRODUCTION

Herpesviruses are a large group of double-stranded (ds) DNA
Viruses responsible for a variety of human and animal diseases.
Therefore, understanding herpesviral DNA replication is of great
importance for the development of effective drugs. In addition,
many herpesviral DNA replication proteins have functional
counterparts in eukaryotes, thereby providing important insights
into eukaryotic DNA replication mechanisms.

Human herpesvirus 1 (HHV-l) has seven proteins essential for
DNA replication. These include origin-binding protein UL9,
DNA polymerase UL30 and its processiVity factor UL42,
single-stranded DNA binding (SSB) protein ICP8 (UL29) and
the tripartite helicaseiprimase complex consisting of UL5, UL52

and UL8. UL5 is a superfamily I DNA helicase (Weller and
Coen, 2012) related to yeast Pif 1 and bacterial RecD
(Hodgman, 1988). UL52 is a primase belonging to the superfam-
ily of archaeo-eukaryotic primases (Iyer et al., 2005). UL8 does
not have any known catalytic activity (Dodson and Lehman,
1991). It appears to be important for the nuclear import of
UL5 and UL52 and is known to interact not only with the
UL}UL52 subcomplex, but also with UL30, ICP8 and UL9
(Muylaert et al., 2011). Surprisingly, despite the essential role
of UL8 in DNA replication, so far nothing is known about its
structure and domain organization. Moreover, there are no
known homologs of UL8 outside the herpesviruses (Muylaert
et al., 2011).

Using a combination of sensitive homology detection methods
and protein structure modeling, we explored the UL8 family and
found that the C—terminal half of UL8 is related to B-family
polymerases. This ﬁnding came as a surprise, because UL8 is
devoid of catalytic activity. Our subsequent sequence and struc-
ture analysis revealed that UL8 has lost motifs important for the
polymerase catalytic activity and has undergone a reduction of
DNA-binding motifs. To see whether UL}UL527UL8 helicasei
primase is evolutionary conserved in herpesviruses, we further
explored each of the three components. As a result, we identiﬁed
‘missing’ UL5 helicases in the family Malacoherpesviridae,
thereby providing further support for the evolutionary conserva-
tion of the helicaseiprimase complex. Interestingly, interactions
related to those within the helicaseiprimase complex have also
been observed in eukaryotes.

2 METHODS
2.1 Databases

Non-redundant (‘nr’) protein sequence database was obtained from NCBI
(ftp://ftp.ncbi.n1m.nih.gov/b1ast/db/). Viral protein sequences were also
downloaded from NCBI using the following query: ‘http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/protein/?term=dsDNA+viruses,+no+RNA+stage’.

2.2 Homology searches

Routine sequence similarity searches were performed using PSI-BLAST
(Altschul et al., 1997) and Jackhmmer (Eddy, 2011). Searches were run
against the nr70 sequence database (the NCBI ‘nr’ database ﬁltered to
70% identity) till convergence using E-value: 1e-03 or a more stringent
inclusion threshold. We performed high sensitivity searches with HHpred
(deing et al., 2005). Proﬁles were built with PSI-BLAST (three iter-
ations, the 1e-03 inclusion threshold). Resulting proﬁles were then used
as queries for searching against proﬁle databases derived from known

protein structures in PDB (www.pdb.org) or SCOP (Murzin et al., 1995)
and from protein families in Pfam (Punta et al., 2012).

2.3 Homology modeling

Initial structural templates and corresponding sequence-structure align-
ments were obtained from a number of distant homology detection and
structure modeling servers: I-TASSER (Roy et al., 2010), RaptorX
(Kallberg et al., 2012), pGenTHREADER (Lobley et al., 2009), FFAS-
3D (Xu et al., 2014), HHPred (deing et al., 2005) and COMA
(Margelevicius and Venclovas, 2010). Consensus approach was then
used to select modeling template(s). Sequence-structure alignments were
iteratively improved by monitoring the quality of resulting models with
ProSA-web (W iederstein and Sippl, 2007). Models were constructed with
Modeller 9v10 (Sali and Blundell, 1993).

2.4 Sequence alignments
Structure-based sequence alignments were derived using DaliLite (Holm

and Park, 2000). Multiple sequence alignments were generated with
MAFFT (Katoh and Standley, 2013).

2.5 Sequence clustering

ULS, UL52 and their homologs were clustered using CLANS (Frickey
and Lupas, 2004). Sequences used for clustering were identiﬁed using
Jackhmmer/PSI-BLAST searches against nr70 and viral protein data-
bases and supplemented with experimentally characterized cellular homo-
logs. Non-conserved N- and C-termini were removed from sequences
before clustering. Clustering with CLANS was performed using the
PSI-BLAST option (two iterations against nr70 database with inclusion
threshold of 1e-03 and 1e-45 for UL52 and ULS, respectively).

3 RESULTS
3.1 UL8 is inactivated B-family polymerase

Systematic iterative sequence searches using Jackhmmer and
UL8 proteins as queries provided an initial hint that the UL8
family, instead of being novel, might be related to B-family poly-
merases. For example, the search with bovine herpes Virus 2 UL8
(gi: 14161473) after four iterations produced a statistically sig-
niﬁcant match (E—Value=0.001) with the B-family polymerase
(gi: 150401083) from Methanococcus aeolicus. The results of
more sensitive profileiprofile searches have further substantiated
the initial finding. Thus, HHpred readily identified (95% prob-
ability) the relationship between HHV-l UL8 and the B-family
DNA polymerase from the archaeon Thermococcus gorgonarius
(SCOP: d1tgoa2). This newly discovered relationship was also
consistently supported by other sensitive homology detection
and modeling servers (see Section 2). The identified similarity
between UL8 and B-family polymerases is limited to the
C-terminal half of UL8 sequences (~393—727 a.a. of HHV-1)
(Fig. 1). The relationship is remote as the aligned region of
UL8 proteins and B-family representatives shares only 942%
sequence identity. Our attempts to identify any characterized
homolog of the UL8 N-terminal region were unsuccessful. This
does not necessarily mean that the region harbors novel struc-
tural domain(s). B-family polymerases at their N-terminus typ-
ically have the exonuclease domain (Rothwell and Waksman,
2005). Thus, it is conceivable that the UL8 N-terminal region
represents an exonuclease-like domain diverged beyond
recognition.

To further corroborate the identiﬁed homology and to obtain
insight into the structure of UL8 C-terminal region (UL8c), we
constructed homology models for UL8c of HHV-1 (available at
http://www.ibt.lt/bioinformatics/models/hhv1_u18/) and its rela-
tives from the SimplexVirus genus (Supplementary Table S1).
Models were constructed using the structure of Escherichia coli
PolII (PDB: 3k57) (Wang and Yang, 2009) as a template from
the optimized sequence-structure alignments. To have reference
points, we constructed computational models of several B-family
polymerases using the same Ecoli PolII structure as the model-
ing template. We chose those B-family polymerases, for which
experimentally determined structures were available, and there-
fore, we could obtain the ‘ideal’ (structure-based) alignment be-
tween them and PolII. We only selected B-family polymerases
that were <30% identical to Ecoli PolII, so as to make the
situation more similar to that between UL8 and PolII. Thus,
we chose PolB of phage RB69, yeast Pol 8, Pyrococcus furiosus
PolB and HHV-l DNA polymerase UL30 and generated models
for them using structure-based alignments. Evaluation of models
was performed with Prosa. More negative Prosa Z-score values
imply more energetically favorable structure. Not surprisingly,
Prosa Z-score values for UL8c models were worse than for the
crystal structure of PolII used as a template (—7.48 for HHV-l
UL8c and —8.86 for PolII). Nonetheless, some of UL8c models
scored relatively high (Supplementary Table S1). Moreover,
UL8c models of HHV-1 and some other herpesviruses scored
better than all of the reference models, except for Pfuriosus
PolB. These results strongly suggest that UL8c and B-family
polymerases are indeed structurally similar and imply that
UL8c models are unlikely to contain serious ﬂaws.

To understand the differences between UL8c and B-family
polymerases, we performed a detailed analysis of sequence and
structure motifs. A prominent feature of UL8c is the lack of
the intact active site motif ‘DTD’ (Fig. 1 and Supplementary
Fig. S1). Only the second aspartate from this motif is conserved
in a number of a-herpesviruses. The ﬁngers subdomain, which is
important for recognition and binding of the incoming nucleo-
tide (Rothwell and Waksman, 2005), is reduced in UL8c.
Furthermore, sequence region preceding ﬁngers subdomain has
a deletion in UL8c. In addition, UL8c lacks the ‘KKRY’ motif,
known to play an important role in stabilizing B-form of the
DNA (Franklin et al., 2001). Taken together, these features in-
dicate that UL8 is not an active DNA polymerase, consistent
with the failure to detect any enzymatic activity in UL8 using
experimental approaches (Dodson and Lehman, 1991).
Consistent with modiﬁcations of UL8c DNA-binding motifs,

Herpesviral UL8 is inactive B-family polymerase

UL8 does not exhibit ssDNA or dsDNA binding on its own
(Parry et al., 1993). However, UL8 appears to modulate DNA
binding by UL5-UL52, the other two subunits of helicasei
primase complex (Chen et al., 2011).

Thus, sequence and structure analysis of UL8 indicates that it
lacks motifs necessary for polymerase activity and has undergone
a reduction of DNA-binding motifs.

3.2 Protein—protein binding sites in UL8

UL8c structural models enabled us to look at known and puta-
tive binding sites mediating interactions with other proteins.
Recently, systematic mutagenesis of charged residues into ala-
nines has been carried out for HHV-l UL8 and four replica-
tion-defective mutants were identiﬁed (Muylaert et al., 2012).
Three of the mutants can be mapped onto the model of
HHV-1 (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S1). Mutants A49
(R640A, D642A and E644A) and A53 (R677A and R678A) dis-
played a defective interaction with UL52. The interaction
between mutant A52 (D671A and E673A) and UL52 was only
slightly impaired. In the HHV-l UL8c model, these positions are
close to positions substituted in mutant A53. Our model is in
good agreement with these experimental findings, as all the pos-
itions affecting interaction with UL52 are on the same side of the
model surface.

In addition, a putative protein-binding site is located within
the very C-terminus of UL8, extending beyond the modeled
structure (Supplementary Fig. S1). The C—terminal region fea-
tures a short conserved hydrophobic motif (HHV-l UL8 747-
FLF—749) and is apparently disordered, as predicted by PrDOS
(Ishida and Kinoshita, 2007) at 5% false positive rate and
MetaDisorder3D (Kozlowski and Bujnicki, 2012). A conserved
hydrophobic motif within the disordered region is often a signa-
ture of protein-binding site. It has been established that HHV-l
UL8 interacts with DNA polymerase, and indirectly the inter-
action site was mapped within the C—terminal region of UL8
(Marsden et al., 1997). These results implicated UL8 residues,
important for binding, just upstream of the conserved C-terminal
motif. This suggests that the conserved hydrophobic motif is,
perhaps, a secondary polymerase-binding site. Alternatively, it

may mediate interaction with one of the other multiple binding
partners of UL8.

3.3 UL52 and UL5 are related to eukaryotic PrimPol
family and Pifl helicases, respectively

Since UL8 functions as part of the helicaseiprimase complex, we
decided also to look into homologous relationships of the other
two components of the complex, UL52 and UL5. HHV-l UL52
(gi: 9629434) is a 1058—residue long protein with the C-terminal
half related to archaeo-eukaryotic primases (Iyer et al., 2005).
UL52 homologs, identiﬁed by sequence searches, fall into several
clusters (Supplementary Fig. S2). These include HHV-l UL52
and other Herpesviridae sequences, UL52 homologs from mol-
lusc and cold-blooded animal herpesviruses (Malacoherpesviridae
and Alloherpesviridae families, respectively), A468R-like proteins
from Phycodnaviridae family and a cluster of Viral and eukary-
otic homologs. The latter are exempliﬁed by the recently char-
acterized human PrimPol (CCDClll), which has both primase
and polymerase activities and plays an important role in replica-
tion fork progression through sites of DNA damage (Garcia-
Gomez et al., 2013; Mouron et al., 2013). Human PrimPol is
the first example of an eukaryotic protein harboring both pri-
mase and polymerase activities. Interestingly, in kinetoplastids
this family of proteins has undergone lineage-speciﬁc expansion.
For example, Trypanosoma brucei has four copies of PrimPol
homologs. Two of the more distantly related ones to human
PrimPol (TbPRIl and TbPRI2) were shown to be active pri-
mases and to have roles essential for cell growth and kinetoplast
DNA replication (Bezalel-Buch et al., 2013). The other two
PrimPol-like proteins act as DNA polymerases with TbPPLl
also having a DNA primase activity (Rudd et al., 2013) The
PrimPol group includes Viral proteins from Marseilleviridae,
Mimiviridae, Asfarviridae and Ostreid herpesvirus 1.
Surprisingly, the latter Virus representing Malacoherpesviridae
has three copies of primases. Two of them (OsHV1_ORF7 and
OsHV1_ORF49) clustered with the PrimPol group, whereas the
third one (OsHV1_ORF66) was more similar to herpesviral
UL52 sequences.

UL5 is a member of the SF1 helicase superfamily having
5/ -3/ directionality. Using iterative sequence searches with
HHV-l UL5 (gi: 9629385), we readily detected similarity of
UL5 to eukaryotic and Viral Pifl helicases as well as to more
distantly related homologs of bacterial RecD and T4 Dda heli-
cases. We also identified previously unannotated UL5 homologs
in Malacoherpesviridae (Supplementary Fig. S3). Clustering of
sequence search results revealed that herpesviral UL5 are split
into three groups mirroring the UL52 results. Eukaryotic Pifl
homologs belong to a group displaying the closest similarity to
UL5. Pifl is found in nearly all eukaryotes. Most eukaryotes
including humans have a single Pifl family helicase, but
Saccharomyces cerevisiae has two (ScPifl and Scer3).
Interestingly, T.brucei has as many as eight Pifl paralogs, mir-
roring the expansion of its PrimPol-like proteins. Yeast proteins
represent some of the best characterized members of the Pifl
family. ScPifl affects telomeric, ribosomal and mitochondrial
DNA replication, as well as Okazaki fragment maturation
(Bochman et al., 2010). Recently, ScPifl was also found partici-
pating together with P018 in recombination-coupled DNA

synthesis (Wilson et al., 2013). Scer3 moves with the replica-
tion fork during the DNA replication and helps to pass difﬁcult-
to-replicate sites (szolinsky et al., 2006). Scer3 was found to
interact with Pole, suggesting that it is a stable component of the
replisome (szolinsky et al., 2006).

4 DISCUSSION

Our finding that UL8 is a homolog of B-family polymerases and
that it has lost the active site explains why no catalytic activity of
UL8 could be found. What could be the evolutionary origin of
UL8? One possibility is that UL8 originated from the duplication
of herpesviral DNA polymerase, UL30. Alternatively, UL8
could be derived from some ancestral form of a B-family poly-
merase. However, the sequence similarity with B-family polymer-
ases is low, precluding a straightforward answer to this question.
The analysis of homologs of UL52 and UL5, the other two sub-
units of helicaseiprimase complex, showed that their links to
eukaryotic enzymes are even clearer. Thus, all three components
of helicaseiprimase complex have mechanistic and perhaps func-
tional similarities with the corresponding eukaryotic proteins.
For example, UL8, an inactive polymerase, may be compared
with the C-terminal region of Pole, which corresponds to an
inactivated exonuclease-polymerase module serving as a pro-
tein-binding platform (Tahirov et al., 2009). UL5 has recently
been found to interact with the polymerase UL30 (Weller and
Coen, 2012), whereas yeast Pifl interacts with P018 (Wilson et al.,
2013). UL527UL5 forms subassembly as part of helicasei
primase complex. An interesting question is whether their
eukaryotic homologs interact or at least cooperate in certain
conditions. Although the direct evidence is lacking, there are
some hints that they might. For example, PrimPol and Pifl
both help to bypass difﬁcult-to-replicate sites (szolinsky
et al., 2006; Garcia-Gomez et al., 2013). The observation of the
correlated expansion of the PrimPol-like and Pifl protein
families in trypanosomes is another hint that they might be
linked functionally if not physically. At least two pairs of trypa-
nosomal PrimPol and Pifl homologs participate in the same
processes. Thus, TbPRIl and TbPIF2 function in replication
of DNA maxicircles while TbPRI2 and TbPIFl are involved in
replication and segregation of minicircles (Bezalel-Buch et al.,
2013). Obviously, differences between the herpesviral and the
eukaryotic counterparts are to be expected. However, the con-
sideration of similarities may provide help in advancing the
knowledge in both systems.

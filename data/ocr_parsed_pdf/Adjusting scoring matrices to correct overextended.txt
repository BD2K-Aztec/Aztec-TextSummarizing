Fig. 1. Homologous overextension. BLASTP with BLOSUM62 was used
to create an alignment between a RPD2 query and a homologous se-
quence from the RPD2 library. The raw BLASTP output and a sche-
matic of the sequences are shown. Homologous domains in the query
(top) and subject (bottom) sequence are represented by black boxes. Light
gray boxes in the library sequence indicate other domains. The embedded
domain in this query is from BOTE74_HELMI and the sequence in the
query outside of the embedded domain is shufﬂed. Black numbers show
the homologous domain boundaries in both the schematic and raw
BLASTP output (in boxes); gray numbers indicate the boundaries of
the neighboring domain. The boundaries of the alignment are given by
the open box, whereas the correct alignment is represented by the dark
gray box in the schematic

2010b) initially used to characterize alignment overextension with PSI-
BLAST, using protein domains and sequences annotated in Pfam version
26 (Punta et 01., 2012). From 13 672 initial Pfam version 26 families, 136
families were selected that met the following criteria: (i) model length
(>200 residues); (ii) available structure; (iii) family size (>100 members);
and (iv) taxonomic diversity (presence in two of three kingdoms of life
with the second most abundant kingdom having at least 15% as many the
members as the most abundant). Although most Pfam domain families
can be represented by a single hidden Markov model (HMM), some
diverse families require multiple HMMs. When this occurs, the related
domain families are grouped into Pfam clans. Protein domains belonging
to the same Pfam family or Pfam clan are homologous to each other.
Only a single family from any one clan was included and then only if the
family model lengths of the HMMs in the clan differed by <2-fold. Of the
136 families selected, 56 were members of clans. Four RNA polymerase
families were excluded because they have a complex and inconsistent
domain organization.

2.1.2 Selecting sequences for the RPD2 library For each of the
RPD2 families, up to 5000 non-viral full-length (>80% of Pfam model
length) domains were randomly selected. The unique protein sequences
from which the domains came were then identiﬁed and included in the
RPD2 library. Low complexity regions were lowercase masked by pseg
and stored in FASTA format. Because many of these sequences con-
tained domains other than the identifying domain, the ﬁnal RPD2 library
contains 1837 families ranging in membership from 7063 examples of the
domain to 1. In total, the RPD2 library contains 499 058 domains from
282 742 different protein sequences.

2.1.3 Creating query sets for RPD2 For each RPD2 family, 10 non-
viral full-length examples of the domain were randomly selected. These
domain sequences were used as queries against the RPD2 library.
Searches were performed with SSEARCH version 36.3.6. The example
of the domain that was able to ﬁnd the largest number of the RPD2
library domains with an E()-score 5 10’3 was selected to be that family’s
query sequence. Each selected domain was embedded in the center of
shufﬂed sequence with the same length and amino acid composition as
the original domain.

2.2 Database searches and scoring matrices

Searches were performed using BLASTP version 2.2.27+ (Camacho
et 01., 2009) or SSEARCH version 36.3.6 (Pearson, 2000). A
SSEARCH comparison of 136 query sequences against the 282742 se-
quence RPD2 library took about 2min on a 48 core machine. Bit scores,
sequence identity, expectation values and alignments were calculated by
the search algorithm. All alignments had an E()-score 5 10’“ with a
domain originally annotated by Pfam. Two types of scoring matrices
were evaluated: the BLOSUM62 routinely used with BLASTP and the
VTML matrices (VT) described by Muller et a]. (2002). For the VT, the
gap penalties described by Reese and Pearson (2002) were adjusted to
produce a smooth mean identity transition. The gap penalties used for
each matrix are shown in Table 1.

2.3 Boundary accuracy

Boundaries for each alignment were known because the query domain
was embedded in shufﬂed sequence. Alignments that extend outside of
the embedded domains into the shufﬂed sequence are overextended.
Alignments that fail to extend to the domain boundaries are incomplete.
Alignment boundaries within :|:10 residues of the embedded domain
boundary are considered correct. The beginning and end of the align-
ments were evaluated independently, and the difference between the
alignment boundaries and the embedded domain boundaries was calcu-
lated in number of residues. Incomplete alignments had negative bound-
ary errors and overextended alignments had positive boundary errors.

2.4 Sub-alignment scoring

SSEARCH from FASTA version 36.3.6 can provide location, identity
and score values for non-overlapping subsections of any alignment. In
this study, we annotated the embedded domain and non-domain regions
in each query, which provided the score and identity for the homologous
correct alignment, even if the alignment was overextended. For overex-
tended alignments, the identity and score of the shufﬂed sequence that
was included in the alignment was also calculated.

2.5 Scoring matrix adjustment

Alignments with greater than 36% identity were realigned using a series
of VTML matrices. The new matrix was selected based on the
BLOSUM62 identity given in Table 2.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Homologous overextension

Deep scoring matrices can produce inaccurate alignment bound—
aries. Figure 1 shows an example of an overextended alignment
created by BLASTP. The query was constructed using an E1—E2
ATPase (PF00122) domain from BOTE74_HELMI surrounded
by shufﬂed sequence (dashed lines). This domain is homologous
to the E1—E2 ATPase domain, also labeled PF00122, in the li—
brary sequence. The PF00122 domain extends from position 113

Adjusting scoring matrices

 

top 100 alignments for each query, overextension is corrected
73% of the time, whereas incomplete alignments are produced
only about 10% of the time. For the top 25, overextension is
corrected 86% of the time, whereas alignments become incom—
plete only 1% of the time.

We believe our estimates of alignment overextension (740%
of alignments) are conservative, both because sequence databases
are growing, allowing similarity searches to identify closer homo—
logs, and because many proteins comprise multiple domains. In
this study, we examine alignment overextension from a single
domain. Many proteins contain multiple domains separated by
non—homologous regions; proteins that contain multiple widely
dispersed common domains, like Ankyrin, fn3 or SH3 domains,
will have many more chances to overextend across non—homolo—
gous regions.

Although we understand why high identity alignments might
overextend when aligned with low targetiidentity scoring matri—
ces like BLOSUM62, matrix/targetiidentity mismatch only ac—
counts for about half of the overextensions we observed. In our
diverse sequence set, 53% of overextensions occur in alignments
that are <36% identical. Unfortunately, we cannot predict which
lower identity alignments will overextend. The amount of overex—
tension does not correlate well with the difference between align—
ment identity and scoring matrix target identity. Likewise,
overextension does not occur signiﬁcantly more often in domains
that have more identity at their ends. The increased frequency of
overextended boundaries in alignments between high identity se—
quences (Fig. 2B) is the only meaningful trend that we identiﬁed.

In contrast to high identity overextension, where the difference
in targetiidentity between the homologous region and the scor—
ing matrix can explain overextension, low identity overextension
may simply reﬂect the propensity of deep matrices to produce
long alignments, even between unrelated sequences (Fig. 3). The
long alignments in Figure 3 are not statistically signiﬁcant, but
when they occur by chance near a (low identity) homologous
domain, they can contribute to overextension. Overextension
occurs more frequently in higher identity alignments because of
targetiidentity mismatch, but the majority of overextension we
measured occurs by chance in low identity alignments, because
most of our alignments are low identity.

In this study, we have focused on overextension in pairwise
alignments because pairwise similarity searches are widely used
to annotate newly sequenced genomes. Alignment overextension
also occurs with model—based searches like PSI—BLAST; we ini—
tially identiﬁed overextension as the major cause of model con—
tamination with PSI—BLAST (Gonzalez and Pearson, 2010a).
Our strategy for reducing overextensionire—alignment with a
more correct scoring matrixiis most easily applied to pairwise
alignment because a traditional noniposition—specific scoring
matrix like BLOSUM62 or VT120 has an easily characterized
target identity and the alignment between two sequences has a
natural evolutionary distance. It is more difﬁcult to interpret the
‘distance’ between a sequence and a position—speciﬁc scoring
matrix or HMM, and it is unclear how such models might be
scaled to reduce overextension.

The expansion of modern protein databases has led to an in—
crease in the identiﬁcation of higher identity homologs. Accurate
function prediction requires a higher level of sequence identity
and an accurate alignment, two factors that are at odds with
deep scoring matrices. With modern comprehensive databases,
it is common to identify many homologs that are >40% identi—
cal. In our diverse RPD2 protein set, the median sequence iden—
tity for the top 100 homologs was 53%, much higher than the
target identity range for BLOSUM62. With more high identity
homologs and increased sequence and structural annotation,
pairwise alignments can provide essential insights to the function
of novel proteins, but only if the alignment boundaries are
accurate.

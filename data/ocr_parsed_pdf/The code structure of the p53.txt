The code structure of the p53 DNA-binding domain

 

loop are shown in Figure 2. There was no statistically significant
difference in overall survival and recurrence—free survival
between the patients with mutation in the L3 loop and those
with wild—type (P:0.0574 for the log—rank test, Fig. 2A;
P=0.277 for the Wilcoxon test, P=0.35 for the log—rank test,
Fig. 2C). In contrast, there was a significant difference in the
overall survival between the patients with the L3 loop that is
close to the (24, 16)—BCH code and the patients with the L3
loop that is far from that code (5—year overall survival: 82
versus 25%, Fig. 2B). The generator polynomial of the (24,
16)—BCH code was G(x) = x8 + 00:6 + 00:4 + 00:2 + at, provided
that the four bases were T—> 0, G—> l, A—> a and C—> a2.

In addition, there was a statistically significant difference in
the recurrence—free survival between the patients with the L3 loop
that is close to the (6, 4)—BCH code and the patients with the L3
loop that is far from that code (5—year overall survival: 47.2
versus 25%, Fig. 2D). The generator polynomial of the (6, 4)—
BCH code was G(x) = x2 + 1, provided that the four bases were
G—> 0, A—> l, T—> a and C—> a2.

4 DISCUSSION

The tumor—suppressor gene TP53 mutations are diverse in the
central region encoding the DNA—binding domain. It has not
been clear whether the prognostic signiﬁcance for survival in
breast cancer patients is the same for all types of mutations.
Are there speciﬁc types of mutations carrying a worse prognosis?
We studied the code structure of the DNA—binding domain of
breast cancer patients by using various artiﬁcial codes in infor—
mation transmission.

In this study, we found a signiﬁcant relation between the code
structure of the DNA—binding domain and the breast cancer
prognosis. Various types of mutations in the DNA—binding
domain were classiﬁed by the code structure. We indicated that
the prognostic significance of all types of mutations in the DNA—
binding domain is not the same, and that the DNA—binding
domain having a certain code structure is important for estimat—
ing the prognosis of breast cancer patients. We are convinced
that the classiﬁcation according to the code structure of the
DNA—binding domain is useful for predicting patients who
have a high mortality.

Although novel TP53 mutations are continuously reported,
the biological function is incompletely understood for many
mutant p53 proteins (Berge et al., 2013). Our classiﬁcation may
be also useful for establishing effect of individual mutation on
protein properties such as cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and
senescence.

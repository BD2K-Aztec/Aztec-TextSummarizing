(Bodenhofer et al., 2011). Additionally, visualization of clusters
and graphical representations of molecular properties are also
available, which provide insights into the compounds’ physico—
chemical similarity level.

The ChemBioServer web application is divided into six main sections:
(i) basic search, (ii) ﬁltering, (iii) advanced ﬁltering, (iv) clustering, (v) cus-
tomize pipeline and (vi) visualize compounds’ properties. The application
back-end is developed in R programming language (http://cran.r-project.
org/), while the front-end is implemented with PHP (http://www.php.
net/). 2D/3D display of compounds is accomplished by means of the
open-source Java viewer for chemical structures JChemPaint (http://
JChemPaint.sourceforge.net) and Jmol (http://www.jmol.org/), respect-
ively. Compound Fingerprints are generated with Open Babel (12). The
format of the ﬁles that are uploaded to the ChemBioServer is either SDF
or MOL. However, transformation from other ﬁle formats is facilitated
through proper links in the help page.

The ‘Basic Search’ section (i) enables the researcher to browse the
contents of a compound ﬁle that is uploaded to the server. After the
upload, SDF ﬁles are processed with the use of the ChemmineR (Cao
et al., 2008) package for R. Compounds are displayed with their molecu-
lar name in a list form with their corresponding SDF information at-
tached such as the molecular name, the connection table, the atom, bond
and property block, etc. In addition, 3D visualization of each compound
is available by clicking on the atom name.

In the ‘Filtering’ section (ii), compound mining can be performed based
on a variety of chemical properties. In the predeﬁned queries section, the
researcher is able to upload a ﬁle and select compounds that comply with
the Lipinski Rule of Five. In addition, in the combined search section,
searching can be performed by applying more advanced criteria such as
partition coefficient logP or Polar Surface Area (PSA) (Guha, 2007).

Three main ﬁltering methods are provided in the ‘Advanced Filtering’
section (iii): (a) the exact substructure ﬁltering can be accomplished by
uploading two compound ﬁles and identifying whether compounds of the
second ﬁle can be found in the ﬁrst. It should be noted that the second ﬁle
can also contain fragments of unwanted or toxic moieties; the algorithm
recognizes whether the fragment is found within any compound of the
ﬁrst ﬁle and reports it. This ﬁltering step is accomplished by converting
ﬁles to Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry Speciﬁcation (SMILES)
with the use of Open Babel (O’Boyle et al., 2011) and applying maximum
common substructure searches for pairs of molecules (Guha, 2007).
(b) Additional toxicity ﬁltering is performed by screening out compounds
that contain a collection of toxic and carcinogenic fragments that is
provided on site. (c) The vdW ﬁltering to discard molecules with steric
clashes is also provided by means of energy and radii tolerance (Jorgensen
et al., 1996). Poses that are far from the energy minimum are unlikely to
be adopted in nature and hence should be discarded. In several docking
exercises with Glide (Schrodinger, LLC), we have observed that the
post-docking poses often suffer from vdW clashes (see ChemBioServer
help page). In particular, we observed that even after Glide post-docking
minimization, ~20% of the generated poses should be discarded due to
unrealistic vdW interactions, which required automating this procedure.

The ‘Clustering’ section (iv) includes a classical as well as a modern
clustering algorithm. Compound ﬁngerprints are either provided by the
user or generated using the 166 bit MACCS Open Babel ﬁngerprint.
In the case of hierarchical clustering, the user is able to select the distance,
the linkage and a threshold value. In the case of AP clustering, the algo-
rithm takes as input a set of pairwise similarities among compound ﬁn-
gerprints, considering them as potential representative compounds
(exemplars). The clusters are calculated by exchanging messages between

data points until a maximization process converge. Thus, exemplars for
each cluster are proposed to the researcher for further investigation.
Additionally, visualization of clusters is also available as a PDF dendro-
gram plot.

In section (v), a pipeline workﬂow that combines all or part of the
previously described ﬁltering services is provided by the ChemBioServer
so as to speed up the ﬁltering process. Compound sets are successively
tested on enabled ﬁltering modules and molecules that fail are discarded.
When the process in completed, the user is provided with a single ﬁle that
contains compounds that have passed all previously enabled ﬁltering
tests.

In the ﬁnal section (vi), graphical representations of molecular proper-
ties can be created by means of the Rapha'el javascript library (http://
raphaeljs.com/). More precisely, Principal Component Analysis (W ehrens
and Buydens, 2007) of the ﬁrst principal component against the second,
based on the tanimoto coefﬁcient can be applied. In addition, graphical
representation of logP against PSA is also available. Finally, M Wagainst
PSA and logP plots can be performed. Thus, compounds that have sur-
vived from the extensive ﬁltering are then explored for the optimum
subset that will pass to the experimental test phase. We have tested this
pipeline in several test datasets and found that the Server produced ac-
curate results and tremendously helped our CADD process in one auto-
mated step (see Help section of the server).

ABSTRACT

Summary: Statistical validation of peptide assignments from a large-
scale shotgun proteomics experiment is a critical step, and various
methods for evaluating significance based on decoy database search
are in practice. False discovery rate (FDR) estimation of peptide
assignments assesses global significance and corrects for multiple
comparisons. Various approaches have been proposed for FDR esti-
mation but unavailability of standard tools or libraries leads to devel-
opment of many in-house scripts followed by manual steps that are
error-prone and low-throughput. The ProteoStats library provides an
open-source framework for developers with many FDR estimation and
visualization features for several popular search algorithms. It also
provides accurate q-values, which can be easily integrated in any
proteomics pipeline to provide automated, accurate, high-throughput
statistical validation and minimize manual errors.

1 INTRODUCTION

High-throughout shotgun proteomics generates millions of spec-
tra that are assigned to peptides by database searching in an
automated manner. A scoring function is used to calculate the
level of similarity found between the experimental spectrum and
the theoretical spectrum from a peptide. This quantitative value,
known as the score, may be a probability, an expectation value
or a simple score.

Owing to random matching of peaks in a peptide spectral match
(PSM), there is a fuzzy boundary between true and false matches
leading to sensitivity versus speciﬁcity trade-off at any chosen
threshold score. Conventional metrics like P—Value/E-Value are
intended for signiﬁcance assessment of a single hit (or PSM) but
are not suitable for global signiﬁcance assessment in large-scale
datasets. A multiple testing correction procedure known as false
discovery rate (FDR) is applied to the results for controlling the
false positives globally. Target-decoy (TD) search-based FDR es-
timation is used as a standard method for global signiﬁcance as-
sessment (Elias and Gygi, 2007; Kall et al., 2008).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Several challenges can arise in (i) dealing with multiple non-
standard file formats, (ii) presence of correct peptides in decoy
results, which should be removed prior to FDR calculation and
(iii) q—Value calculation. Leucine/Isoleucine cannot be distin-
guished by collision-induced dissociation, resulting in identical
scores for both target and decoy peptides. Such peptides need
to be removed from decoy hits. This is a non-trivial exercise if
carried out manually but critical for accurate estimation of FDR
because even one such peptide may penalize hundreds of matches
in target database. The calculation can be tedious for large data-
sets and numerous ﬁles.

FDR estimation has recently been a major ﬁeld of research
in statistical proteomics, and several methods and their reﬁned
variants have been proposed. Unfortunately, not as many tools
are available as there are FDR estimation methods. Most meth-
ods involve custom in-house scripts that may not implement all
nuances of the algorithm and thus lack provenance. Custom
pipelines only include the most popular methods like concate-
nated (Elias and Gygi, 2007) or separate (Kall et al., 2008) meth-
ods, even though the refined methods improve the results.
FDRAnalysis (Wedge et al., 2011) provides FDR for three algo-
rithms but only provides FDR for concatenated search. The bar-
rier to their widespread adoption is the lack of software. This
may also lead to different implementations of same method, code
duplication and a considerable waste of research effort.

2 DESCRIPTION OF PROTEOSTATS

To address the issues mentioned earlier, we have developed an
open-source cross-platform scripting library, ProteoStats, which
uses several FDR estimation procedures. The library is written in
Perl and can be easily interfaced with other pipelines. The library
also provides a simple programming interface for Visualizing
these results and quality control of PSMs. ProteoStats supports
OMSSA (Geer et al., 2004), MassWiz Wadav et al., 2011b),
Mascot (Perkins et al., 1999), XITandem (Craig and Beavis,
2004), Sequest (Eng et al., 1994), MyriMatch (Tabb et al.,
2007) and Comet (Eng et al., 2013), besides the generic
PerML and text ﬁle formats (Fig. 1).
TD searches can be conducted as follows:

0 Separate searches: The spectra are searched separately
against the target and decoy databases independent of
each other. Each spectrum has two best hitsione from
the target and another from decoy.

o Concatenated searches: The spectra are searched in a single
concatenated database formed by combining the target and
decoy proteins. The target and decoy candidate peptides
compete against each other. Each spectrum will be assigned
either a target or a decoy peptide as the best hit.

The two approaches are different only in the context of TD com-
petition, which can be held a posteriori (Fitzgibbon et al., 2008).
Because it is easy to perform the TD competition even after a sep-
arate search, ProteoStats library requires results from separate
search irrespective of the FDR method a user wants to select.

The ProteoStats library supports many formulations on FDR:

o Concatenated FDR (Elias and Gygi, 2007)

Separate FDR (Kall et al., 2008)

FDR with percentage of incorrect target correction (Kall
et al., 2008)

o Reﬁned FDR on separate method (Navarro and Vazquez,
2009)

o Reﬁned method on concatenated FDR (Cerqueira et al.,
2010)

The ProteoStats library estimates FDR using the desired
method in a series of steps that involve (i) native result file read-
ing and conversion to text format, (ii) removing decoy peptides
identical to target peptides, (iii) preparing target and decoy score
arrays, (iv) estimating false positives based on FDR method, (V)
iteratively calculating FDR for every decoy score as threshold
and (Vi) calculating q-Values and writing output to a ﬁle. For
Visual analysis, receiver-operating characteristic curves (ROC)
and various types of scatter plots and histograms can be plotted
from FDR ﬁles (see Supplementary Data). The output is for-
matted in an easy to manipulate CSV/text ﬁle for further pro-
cessing using any scripting language making subsequent analysis
hassle-free. For charts, Excel spreadsheets can be created. These
ﬁles can be easily imported into R environment for further data
Visualization/p0st-processing.

The test datasets, sample input and expected outputs with
ROC curves are provided along with a comparative table for
various FDR methods across search engines (Supplementary
Data). ProteoStats library has been extensively used in

MassWiz, GenoSuite (Kumar et al., 2013) and integrated
multi-algorithmic analysis on plasma Wadav et al., 2011a).
The FlexiFDR method Wadav et al., 2012) was also developed
on top of the core framework of this library.

3 CONCLUSION

Proteostats is a highly versatile, platform independent, open-
source, extensible and easy-to-use framework for FDR estima-
tion and statistical control of results from shotgun proteomics
database search. Apart from providing an assorted list of differ-
ent FDR estimation procedures, it also provides single PSM
metric-like q—Values, and Visualization features like ROC, histo-
gram, Venn diagram and scatterplot for data quality assessment
and comparative analysis.

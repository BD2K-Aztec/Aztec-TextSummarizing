Abstract

Motivation: Unraveling the molecular mechanisms that underlie disease calls for methods that go
beyond the identification of single causal genes to inferring larger protein assemblies that take part
in the disease process.

Results: Here, we develop an exact, integer—programming—based method for associating protein
complexes with disease. Our approach scores proteins based on their proximity in a protein—
protein interaction network to a prior set that is known to be relevant for the studied disease. These
scores are combined with interaction information to infer densely interacting protein complexes
that are potentially disease—associated. We show that our method outperforms previous ones and
leads to predictions that are well supported by current experimental data and literature knowledge.

1 Introduction

The association of genes with disease is a fundamental problem with
important medical applications. Gene prioritization techniques are
based on different types of data ranging from sequence and hom—
ology information to function and molecular interactions (see
Bromberg, 2013 for a review). State—of—the—art methods for priori—
tization employ protein—protein interaction (PPI) information, based
on the empirical finding that genes that cause similar diseases tend
to lie close to one another in the PPI network. Many methods have
been developed following this reasoning. Lage et al. (2007) score a
candidate gene in a linkage interval according to the clinical overlap
between the phenotypes associated with its interactors and the dis—
ease in question. Kohler et al. (2008) perform a random walk on the
PPI network, starting at the known disease genes, and rank candi—
date genes by the steady state probabilities induced by the walk.
Vanunu et al. (2010) apply a propagation algorithm that starts at
causal genes, weighted by the phenotypic similarity of the disease
they cause and a query disease, and compute a strength—of—
association function that is smooth over the network. Magger et al.
(2012) focused on the tissue where a given disease is manifested and
executed the same propagation algorithm over a tissue—specific net—
work that was inferred by gene expression data.

Another approach for performing gene prioritization is via infer—
ence from existing functional annotations. For example, Schlicker

et al. (2010) rank candidate genes by the semantic similarity of their
GO annotations (The Gene Ontology Consortium, 2000) to the GO
terms associated with the known disease genes. This approach, how—
ever, relies on the availability of gene annotations and thus could
miss related genes with yet unknown function. A related line of
works relies on the description and comparison of phenotypes using
ontologies (Robinson et (11., 2008; Smith et (11., 2005). In particular,
Hoehndorf et al. (2011) computed all the pairwise similarities be—
tween phenotypes in several organisms as well as phenotypes associ—
ated with human diseases. A model organism phenotype that
exhibits high similarity to a human phenotype may suggest the
corresponding genotype as a candidate for the human disease.
Robinson et al. (2014) integrated this approach with exome se—
quence analysis by considering both the phenotypic relevance of a
gene as well as evidence from its sequence reﬂecting the rarity and
pathogenicity of the gene’s variants.

Despite the availability of numerous methods for exposing the
genomic basis underlying human diseases, most of these methods
are limited to the discovery of individual genes. Many studies, how—
ever, link diseases to dysfunctions of assemblies of proteins working
in concert. A well—known example is the Leigh syndrome, an in—
herited neurometabolic disorder caused by deficiencies in mitochon—
drial complexes (Amberger et (11., 2009) (MIM no. #256000).
Cancer related complexes were reported by Kadoch et al. (2013)
and Santidrian et al. (2013). Therefore, a more systematic

understanding of certain disorders could be achieved by looking dir—
ectly for related protein complexes rather than focusing on single
proteins (Zhao et (11., 2013). Several papers have approached this
problem from a computational view. Vanunu et al. (2010) apply
their propagation algorithm to mark potential disease related pro—
teins, and then look for high scoring protein complexes, measured in
terms of the specificity of their interactions with respect to a random
model. The HotNet2 algorithm of Leiserson et al. (2015) considers
mutated genes across cancer patients, looking for significantly
mutated subnetworks. To this end, from each such gene HotNet2
diffuses heat over the PPI network, yielding a diffusion matrix or a
weighted digraph. The strongly connected components of this di—
graph are the inferred ‘hot’ subnetworks. Finally, the MAXCOM
method of Chen et al. (2014) scores candidate complexes from
CORUM (Ruepp et (11., 2010) by computing the maximum ﬂow
from a query disease to a target complex in an integrated network
combining disease—disease similarities, disease—gene associations and
PPIS.

In this paper we address the problem of protein complex detec—
tion by devising a framework that integrates network propagation
with a novel integer program algorithm designed to discover dense
clusters with highly specific interactions. The outline of the frame—
work is depicted in Figure 1. We test our framework by computing
protein clusters for tens of diseases and compare our predictions to
those of two leading tools for subnetwork detection, PRINCE
(Vanunu et (11., 2010) and HotNet2 (Leiserson et (11., 2015). We
show that the clusters produced by our method are both denser and
more biologically relevant. We also present expert analyses for two
diseases—epilepsy syndrome and intellectual disability, demonstrat—
ing the ability of our algorithm to find relevant disease clusters as
well as to predict novel disease protein associations.

2 Materials and methods

The computational framework we have devised works in two con—
ceptual phases: (i) identification of network regions that are poten—
tially associated with the disease under study; and (ii) inference of
densely interacting protein clusters within those regions. We de—
scribe these phases in detail in the sequel.

2.1 Constructing a disease—relevant subnetwork
As we look for complexes that are related to a certain disease, we
wish to focus on network regions surrounding proteins that are

top 1000 propagation scores for different prior sizes (100, 25, 10, from left to
right), excluding prior nodes. Each subplot shows results from 10 random
executions. Clearly, the smaller the prior size, the faster the function con-
verges to 0

already known to be associated with the disease. To find such re—
gions, we follow the approach of Vanunu et al. (2010) and apply a
network propagation algorithm that starts at the known disease—
causing (prior) proteins, and ranks all other network proteins by
computing their propagation scores. Formally, given a network
G : (V, E), a normalized weight function w : E —> JR and a prior
knowledge function Y : V —> R, we seek a function F : V —> R that
both respects the prior knowledge and is smooth over the network.
Denoting the set of neighbours of v by N(v), F is expressed as
follows:

PM = aizuemnnmmwu + (1 - o0Y0!)

The function F can be computed accurately using simple linear
algebra, but can be more efficiently approximated using an iterative
procedure.

To select the most relevant proteins from the ranked list, we first
note that for different prior sizes, the propagation function assigns
scores of different magnitudes: the smaller the prior size, the faster
the scores drop to 0. For example, on random priors of sizes 10, 25
and 100, the 200th largest score has a mean of 0.002, 0.006 and
0.018, respectively (with standard deviations around 0.001), over
10 executions (with respect to the PPI network presented below).
This is illustrated in Figure 2. Therefore, we sought to devise a nor—
malization method that resolves this bias.

Given a prior set of genes and the corresponding propagation
distribution, we executed the propagation algorithm 1000 times
over random sets of the same size. For each gene, we ranked its real

score with respect to its scores on the random data (excluding the
random instances where that gene was selected for the prior). This
provides a P—value for every gene, allowing us to focus on the signifi—
cant ones (a threshold of 0.01 is used in the sequel).

2.2 Detection of protein complexes

Given an initial network G and a disease—related subnetwork
H : (V, E), we wish to find highly interacting protein sets within H.
To this end, we follow the scheme of Vanunu et al. (2010) and de—
fine the score of a protein set C as the log likelihood ratio between a
protein complex model, in which every two proteins in a complex
interact with some high probability [3 (set to 0.9, results are robust
in the range 0.8—0.95), and a random model which assumes that
interactions in the input network occur at random with a probability
proportional to the proteins’ degrees. Denote by d” the degree of
node v in G, and by t the number of edges in G. As the (approxi—
mate) probability of an interaction (1', j) to appear in a random
degree—preserving network is 17,-,- : didi/ 2t, the likelihood score for
an interaction (1', j) which participates in C is L; : log(/)’/p,-,-).
Similarly, the likelihood score for a non—interaction between pro—
teins i,/' in Cwould be Lgl- : log((1 — li)/(1 — 17,7». Denote by V[C]
and  the sets of nodes and edges of C, respectively. The likeli—
hood score of C is computed as:

MC): 2 Lii+ 2 L3;-

(iri)EElCl iriEVlCl « WEE

To detect high scoring protein sets, we formulate an integer lin—
ear program (ILP) that makes use of two sets of variables. First, for
each node i E V, a binary variable U,- will indicate whether i is part
of the formed cluster. Second, we could now define for every 1', j E V
a binary variable e,,- that indicates whether i and j are both in the
formed cluster. The objective function would then be:

1 O
maxi: Lira/'4' Z Lireii

(1106B (me Vx V\E

However, as the number of such variables is quadratic in (V), this
would be a burden on the ILP performance. We therefore define (3,,-
variables only for edges rather than all node pairs, and estimate the
penalty on missing edges as a constant Lg- : y : —2.3, as we found
L0 to be well approximated by it (in a network of 150 000 edges,
when the geometric mean of di, di varies between 2 and 100, L3-
ranges between —2.3 and —2.26).

The following integer program finds a highest scoring cluster:

i6N(i)

The equalities 1 and 2 set R and T as the number of nodes and
edges in the cluster, respectively. Constraint 3 stipulates that 8,7

equals 1 if and only if both its endpoints were selected for the clus—
ter. Constraint 4 requires that every cluster node be connected to at
least half of the other cluster members, ensuring that the cluster’s
diameter is at most two.

The above program is quadratic as it contains the term R2 in the
objective function. To linearize it, we exploit the fact that the size of
a real complex is typically no more than 20 (Vanunu et (11., 2010).
Thus, we can define a small set of if—then statements that determine
R2. Assuming the cluster size R is in the range [m,M], the following
constraints are added:

R—c+1 R

T S gc S : V6 6 [m,M] (5)

—R 1 M —R

L S 55 S +—C Vc e [m,M] (6)
c M

$c+gc — 1 S as S Saga yo 6 [m,M] (7)

sq : 2 old, (8)

m g c g M
Constraints 5 and 6 set the auxiliary binary variables g5 and $5 to
1 if and only if R 2 c, or R g c, respectively. Constraint 7 combines
g5 and $5 to define as : 1 if R : c, or otherwise as : 0. Finally, as R
must be equal to exactly one c in the range [m,M], the sum in 8

R . . . .
equals R2. Consequently, the term (2) 1n the ob]ect1ve functlon

can be replaced by the linear term % (sq — R).

It is worth noting that the above ILP is significantly faster than a
naive linearization approach that runs the basic quadratic program
iteratively with R fixed in each iteration.

2.3 Implementation details and parameter selection
Following Vanunu et al. (2010), in the propagation phase we as—
signed similar weight (0r : 0.5) to the contribution of the prior data
on disease genes versus the network topology and its confidence
scores. The genes with the most significant propagation scores were
chosen using a strict P—value cutoff of 0.01. The input network for
the clustering phase was the PPI subnetwork induced by those genes.
In the cluster detection phase, we used the likelihood scores
described in Section 2.2, and excluded hubs with degree above 500.
We instructed the ILP algorithm to find the top scoring cluster with
size between 4 and 20, then removed its nodes from the network
and iterated. We repeated this process 10 times or until no cluster
could be found (typically due to the strict connectivity constraint 4
in the ILP).

3 Results

3.1 Gene—disease association retrieval

We collected high—quality disease—protein associations from several
databases: OMIM (Amberger et (11., 2009), OrphaData (Orphanet,
www.orphadata.org) and DISEASES (Pletscher—Frankild et (11.,
2014). From the latter source we used only the ‘knowledge channel’
which contains manually curated associations from the Genetics
Home Reference (Mitchell et (11., 2006) and the UniProt
Knowledgebase (The UniProt Consortium, 2014).

The unification of the data from the three databases required
careful handling of several aspects. First, a common dictionary was
required for disease identification. Second, different databases de—
scribe diseases in different resolutions. For example, the ALS disease
has 20 subtypes in OMIM, each of which is associated with one or

two genes; in the other two databases this disease is represented
using only one to three subtypes. To handle the different standards,
we categorized the diseases using the Disease Ontology (DO)
(Schriml et (11., 2012), which provides a hierarchical structure of dis—
eases and groups of diseases. For each gene—disease association from
one of the databases, we propagated it upstream through the ontol—
ogy hierarchy. The linkage between DO terms and OMIM diseases
was performed using an available mapping in the DO database; the
integration with OrphaData was name based; the DISEASES data—
base was already standardized with DO identifiers. Using these map—
pings, we extracted 2753 disease—gene associations from OMIM,
923 associations from OrphaData and 3887 associations from
DISEASES, which in total span 1099 net disease terms, or 1546
terms after accounting for the ontology hierarchy. We removed
terms with less than 10 genes or terms that are not directly associ—
ated to a gene in any of the databases and are located more than one
level above some leaf node. To avoid redundancy, for each path
from the root to some leaf we retained at most one term (the most
specific). The final list contained 115 diseases.

3.2 Performance evaluation

We executed our algorithm on each of the tested diseases, providing
it as input the disease’s prior genes (Section 3.1). Our input PPI net—
work was retrieved from the HIPPIE database (Schaefer et (11.,
2012), filtered for its 148 441 medium or high confidence inter—
actions, over 14 388 nodes. We compared the algorithm’s perform—
ance to two state—of—the—art methods for predicting disease
associated protein subnetworks, PRINCE (Vanunu et (11., 2010) and
HotNet2 (Leiserson et (11., 2015 ). In the PRINCE implementation,
we used their suggested propagation score threshold of 0.015 to de—
termine the set of genes to cluster. As HotNet2 is limited to return—
ing subnetworks over its input genes only, we defined the input heat
of a gene as a large constant c if it is a prior gene, and 1 otherwise;
we tested two values for c, 10 and 1000, and obtained similar re—
sults, henceforth we report the results achieved with c : 10. A sub—
network produced by HotNet2 was considered significant if the
empirical P—value reported for its size or any smaller size was less
than 0.05.

Our ILP algorithm predicted 638 clusters, spanning all the 114
diseases that had at least one prior gene in the PPI network (the ac—
tual minimum prior size was 6). The PRINCE algorithm returned
402 clusters. Expectedly, the number of clusters that PRINCE gener—
ated per disease strongly depended on its prior set size
(P < 6 X 10‘7, Pearson correlation), while the correlation was
much weaker for our algorithm (P<0.03). This gap can be ex—
plained by the ﬂexibility of our propagation P—value scheme, com—
pared to the fixed cutoff approach of PRINCE. The HotNet2
algorithm generated 1215 clusters which cover only 26 diseases; this
ratio was due to the behaviour of the statistical test, which in many
cases failed to find any significant size while in other cases returned
a small size, resulting in tens of subnetworks.

Next, we compared the densities of the clusters output by the dif—
ferent algorithms. The average density of a cluster produced by our
algorithm was 0.72, calculated aggregatively over all 638 clusters
(7697 edges versus 2984 non—edges). In comparison, the same statis—
tic for PRINCE was 0.52, and for HotNet2 only 0.22 (likely due to
the fact that HotNet2 captures also path—like patterns). We also
compared the distributions of the individual cluster densities
induced by the three algorithms. To account for the different num—
ber of clusters produced by each method, we limited the comparison
to the top 5 clusters per disease (as HotNet2 provides no ranking, 5

arbitrary clusters of the smallest size were selected). Further, to ac—
count for the fact that constraint 4 in the ILP has an explicit positive
effect on the density, we applied a variant that excluded it. The dens—
ity values induced by our algorithm were significantly higher than
those of PRINCE (P < 3 X 10‘3, Wilcoxon rank sum test).
Expectedly, the density values were also higher than those of
HotNet2 (P < 10‘45 ). The results are summarized in Figure 3(a).

We further wished to test if our predicted dense clusters signifi—
cantly overlap known biological complexes. To this end, we tested
the overlap of each of the predicted clusters with 2276 known biolo—
gical complexes that we collected from CORUM (Ruepp et (11.,
2010) and GO (The Gene Ontology Consortium, 2000) (GO data
from Nov 2015). Out of the 638 predicted clusters, 328 (51%) had
a statistically significant overlap with at least one complex, accord—
ing to a hypergeometric test, corrected for multiple hypothesis test—
ing using False Discovery Rate (FDR) < 0.05 (Benjamini and
Hochberg, 1995). In comparison, only 145 of the PRINCE clusters
(36%), and 363 of the HotNet2 clusters (30%) significantly inter—
sected a curated complex (Fig. 3(b)).

To validate that the predicted clusters are relevant for the dis—
eases for which they were computed, we used independent sets of
genes that we reserved for validation. We picked these validation
genes from the text—mining and experimental channels in the
DISEASES database (Pletscher—Frankild et (11., 2014), which may be
of lesser quality than those we used for the priors. The intersections

between the ILP predicted genes (taken together over all clusters per
disease, without the prior genes) and the validation sets for 34 out
of 105 diseases (having some validation information) were
statistically significant (FDR—corrected hypergeometric P—
value < 0.05; Fig. 4). A similar analysis for PRINCE yielded 33 dis—
eases with statistically significant intersections; interestingly, the
two methods captured 21 common diseases, which implies that the
methods somewhat complement each other. Finally, only two dis—
eases in the output of HotNet2 were found significant, when con—
sidering only the 23 diseases with at least one cluster and non—empty
validation sets; of these two, one disease was not enriched by any of
the other methods (severe combined immunodeficiency), and an—
other one was enriched by both methods (schizophrenia).

To compare the predictive power of the three algorithms for the
remaining diseases (those for which the FDR was above 0.05), we
tested whether the predicted genes were related to similar diseases.
To this end, we used the pairwise disease similarities reported by
Hoehndorf et al. (2015), which are based on phenotype identifica—
tion using a text—mining approach. For each predicted gene in a dis—
ease d, we looked which of its associated diseases (extracted from
both the prior and the validation data) is most similar to d, and re—
corded the maximal similarity score. We computed the average score
over all the predicted genes for d and defined it as the score of d. We
compared the score distributions as induced by the three algorithms.
While the scores induced by our algorithm and by PRINCE were
comparable, the scores of our algorithm were significantly higher
than those of HotNet2, indicating that our predictions are more
relevant in their context (P < 3 X 10‘3 , Wilcoxon rank sum test).

3.3 Biological case studies

After establishing the utility of our method, we applied it to care—
fully analyze two test cases for which we had expert knowledge.
First, we executed our framework on a set of 97 proteins associated

with the term ‘epilepsy syndrome’ from the Disease Ontology. This
term is the root of a hierarchy of epilepsy subtypes, classified by age
at onset, triggering factors, patterns of seizure and other criteria.
Our algorithm predicted 10 clusters, displayed in Figure 5 (a). The
majority of these clusters are synaptic, consistent with the classifica—
tion of epilepsy as a synaptopathy. The top ranked cluster (in red
color) contains 7 proteins (with 17 internal interactions out of 21
possible ones), out of which three are from the prior, KCNH1,
KCNQ2 and KCNQ3. Mutations in KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 have
long been known to cause benign familial neonatal seizures (BFNS)
(Biervert et (11., 1998; Castaldo et (11., 2002), with recent increasing
evidence also for other types of epileptic diseases (Miceli et (11.,
2015; Weckhuysen et (11., 2012). Proteins encoded by these genes
form potassium channels that transmit electrical signals (called M—
current) regulating neuronal excitability in the brain. Reduced or
altered M—current may lead to excessive excitability of neurons, re—
sulting in seizures. Mutations in KCNH1, another member of the
voltage—gated potassium channel, have also been associated with
epilepsy (Simons et (11., 2015).

Our highest scoring cluster predicts another member of this fam—
ily of genes, KCNQ5, which is widely expressed throughout the
brain. The protein encoded by this gene yields currents that activate
slowly with depolarization and can form heteromeric channels with
the protein encoded by KCNQ3. It has recently been shown that
KCNQ5 has a role in dampening synaptic inhibition in the hippo—
campus (Fidzinski et (11., 2015). In particular, mice lacking func—
tional KCNQ5 channels displayed increased excitability of different
classes of neurons. Thus, KCNQ5 might be an interesting candidate
for further analysis in the context of epilepsy.

The predicted cluster also suggests a role for the Calmodulin
(CaM) proteins CALM1, CALM2, CALM3, which are calcium—
binding messenger proteins with diverse roles in growth and cell
cycle, signal transduction and synthesis and release of

Intellectual disability clusters

Fig. 5. Predicted disease clusters for epilepsy and intellectual disability. These figures show the top ten ranked clusters predicted to play a role in (a) epilepsy and
(b) intellectual disability. In each subfigure, different clusters are shown in distinct colors; the highest scoring cluster is colored red. Diamond nodes indicate
genes from the prior. Three levels of edge thickness denote increasing ranges of interaction likelihood scores. Solid versus dashed edges denote intra-cluster ver-

sus inter-cluster interactions, respectively

neurotransmitters. Recently, it has been shown by Ambrosino et a1.
(2015) that KCNQ2 BNFS—causing mutations express alterations in
CaM binding and that in some cases CaM overexpression restored
normal function of the KCNQ2/KCNQ3—induced channels. Our
prediction thus supports these results by highlighting the importance
of the interactions between KCNQ2 and the CaM proteins.

As a second biological case study, we applied our algorithm to
predict protein complexes related to intellectual disability, a devel—
opmental disorder characterized by significant limitations in intel—
lectual functioning and in practical, communicational and social
skills. The corresponding DO term was associated with 234 prior
genes. Our algorithm predicted 10 clusters, displayed in Figure 5 (b).
The top scoring cluster, which contains 17 proteins and 96 inter—
actions, includes 11 members of the chromatin remodeling BAF
complex (6 of them from the prior). This complex is responsible for
DNA packaging and is thus regarded as a ‘program activation’ com—
plex, making series of genes available for transcription. Mutations
in chromatin regulators are widely associated with human mental
disorders, such as intellectual disability, Coffin—Siris syndrome and
Autism (Ronan et 41]., 2013). Another predicted chromatin regula—
tor, CREBBP, is associated with Rubinstein—Taybi syndrome, whose
phenotypes include moderate to severe learning difficulties.

Our top cluster also contains the KLF1 protein, which is known
as a transcription regulator of erythrocyte development. Mutations
of KLF1 are associated with dyserythropoietic anemia, a rare blood
disorder characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis. Recently, Natiq
et a1. (2014) have reported on a patient with severe developmental
delay, in which they observed chromosomal microdeletion contain—
ing (among others) the KLF1 gene. The exact impact of KLF1 on in—
tellectual disability could thus be a subject for further analysis.

Finally, the EPAS1 gene is a hypoxia—inducible transcription fac—
tor activated at low oxygen levels. As hypoxia during birth is one of
the reasons for intellectual disability, this prediction may highlight a
different aspect of the disease and could be a candidate for further
investigation.

4 Conclusions

We presented a network—based framework for discovering disease
related protein complexes. We conducted several large—scale valid—
ations to show that the predicted clusters are densely interacting and

significantly overlap known complexes and disease proteins. We
also presented an expert analysis for two diseases, suggesting candi—
date proteins for further examination.

Currently, our approach does not take into account differences
in the confidence of prior disease genes, nor other relevant informa—
tion such as their association to diseases with similar phenotypes,
expression patterns in the relevant tissues and mutation studies in
model organisms. We believe that such data integration will allow
predictions with higher coverage and accuracy.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The identity of cells and tissues is to a large degree
governed by transcriptional regulation. A major part is accomplished
by the combinatorial binding of transcription factors at regulatory
sequences, such as enhancers. Even though binding of transcription
factors is sequence-specific, estimating the sequence similarity
of two functionally similar enhancers is very difficult. However, a
similarity measure for regulatory sequences is crucial to detect
and understand functional similarities between two enhancers and
will facilitate large-scale analyses like clustering, prediction and
classification of genome-wide datasets.

Results: We present the standardized alignment-free sequence
similarity measure N2, a flexible framework that is defined for
word neighbourhoods. We explore the usefulness of adding reverse
complement words as well as words including mismatches into
the neighbourhood. On simulated enhancer sequences as well
as functional enhancers in mouse development, N2 is shown to
outperform previous alignment-free measures. N2 is flexible, faster
than competing methods and less susceptible to single sequence
noise and the occurrence of repetitive sequences. Experiments on
the mouse enhancers reveal that enhancers active in different tissues
can be separated by pairwise comparison using N2.

Conclusion: N2 represents an improvement over previous
alignment-free similarity measures without compromising speed,
which makes it a good candidate for large-scale sequence
comparison of regulatory sequences.

1 INTRODUCTION

Mammalian organisms consist of several hundred different cell
types. Every cell has the same repertoire of genes; however,
only a subset will be expressed to enable cell type-speciﬁc
phenotypes. Many different factors regulate gene expression,
of which genetically encoded transcriptional regulation seems

to play the major part (Wilson et (11., 2008). Sequence-dependent
gene regulation is mainly achieved through the binding of
transcription factors at short DNA motifs. These transcription factor
binding sites often occur in regulatory Clusters in the genome,
called cis-regulatory modules (CRMs). Some CRMs can repress
transcription, whereas others, referred to as ‘enhancers’, can enhance
gene expression. Studies in Drosophila showed that the combination
of binding sites together with the set of transcription factors
actively recruited to a CRM determines its cell type speciﬁcity
(Goto et al., 1989; Small et al., 1991; Zinzen et al., 2009). More
generally speaking, regulatory sequences with a similar binding site
content can be expected to drive similar expression patterns. This is
analogous to coding sequences, where sequence similarity has been
used for many years to estimate functional similarity. The pairwise
similarity of coding sequences is usually computed using global
(Needleman and Wunsch, 1970) or local (Smith and Waterman,
1981) alignments. This approach works well for sequences which
are at least partially alignable; however, this is not the case for non-
homologous CRMs. The location and orientation of binding sites in
CRMs that show similar cell type-speciﬁc activity may differ widely,
making it impossible to produce alignments.

Alignment-free methods compare sequences according to their
word content, see (Vinga and Almeida, 2003) for an overview. The
initial purpose was to design a fast and accurate measure of pairwise
(dis-)similarity that could be used in databases where traditional
alignments were too slow (Blaisdell, 1986; Carpenter et al., 2002;
Hide et al., 1994). In the meantime, alignment-free methods have
been applied in other contexts such as phylogeny (Wu et (11., 2009)
and motif ﬁnding (Gordan et al., 2010). The idea to describe a
sequence by its word content directly ﬁts the model of CRMs, where
we assume that a similar ﬁinCtion is reﬂected in a similar binding
site content.

Word count-based methods have been used to compare regulatory
sequences (Kantorovitz et al., 2007; van Helden, 2004). However,
these methods calculate the similarity of sequences based on exact
word counts, whereas transcription factor binding sites are generally
more ﬂexible patterns. Furthermore, the genomic orientation of
CRMs and of the binding sites within is most often unknown,
highlighting the need to compare sequences according to the word
counts on both strands simultaneously. As an example, the word
w = CATAAT might be bound by the same transcription factor as the
words CTTAAT and ATTATG, the former having one substitution,
the latter being on the reverse strand. Exact word comparison
methods consider these words dissimilar. More generally, let n(w) be

Similarity of regulatory sequences

 

the set of words which are similar to w (the ‘neighbourhood’ of w).
To overcome the limitation of exact word comparison methods, we
need to develop a similarity measure that compares sequences based
on word neighbourhoods. Theoretical approaches that consider
approximate word matches have been studied before (Burden et (11.,
2008; Forét et (11., 2006); however, no applicable method has been
published for the purpose of pairwise comparison.

In this study we deﬁne N 2, an alignment-free comparison method
that integrates all words in the neighbourhood of w. We compare N2
to other alignment-free methods on simulated sequences and tissue-
speCiﬁC enhancer sequences identiﬁed in vivo in mouse embryos.
The code and an executable ﬁle of the N2 similarity and other
alignment-free methods presented here is available as part of the
open-source C++ library Squn (Doering et (11., 2008).

2 METHOD
2.1 The N2 similarity score

Traditionally. the idea of alignment-free methods is to compare two
sequences S1 and S2. of length 11 and 12. based on the numbers of occurrences
of all words w of length k over the alphabet E = {A, C , G, T}. Let A be the
set of all such words w with |A| being the total number of words (4k in the
case of DNA sequences). We associate a sequence S of length 1 with the
word count vector

NS =(N51,N52,...,N$IAI), with (1)
l—k-l—l
N3: 2 1(S[i...i+k—1]=w). (2)

i2]

To overcome the restriction to exact word counts. we extend Equation (2) to
word neighbourhood counts. We deﬁne the set of words in the neighbourhood
of the word w as n(w). The neighbourhood may be deﬁned appropriately for
every application. for example. to ﬁt transcription factor binding motifs.
to allow for reverse complement word counts or to include mismatches.
Integrating neighbourhood counts for every word w reduces the inﬂuence
of w itself. This leads to word counts ‘smoothing’. i.e. inexact words are
considered similar. and also to ‘blurring’. since inexact words might not be
related. To control for these effects. we associate every word 14/ in n(w)
with a weight aw/ which may differ for the considered application. We then
compute the weighted word neighbourhood counts NMW) for every word w
of the sequence S:

N50,.) 2 Z aw/Nﬁ/ .
w/er1(w)
Depending on the choice of n(w). Nrfw) might be the sum of highly dependent
variables since word occurrences of overlapping words such as Cw and
W are strongly correlated. Additionally. the variance of individual word
counts should be considered. since. for example. a high number of CAGCTG
occurrences is more informative than a high count of self overlapping
words such as AAAAAA where a Poly-A stretch of length 15 already gives
10 occurrences. Furthermore. some words are more likely to occur than
others. GC-rich words for example are less frequent in mammalian genomes
than AT-rich words. We correct for inter-variable dependency. word count
variances and word probabilities by standardizing the word neighbourhood
counts:
NS

S
NS = r1(w) _]E[Nn(w)]

l/ViNiwﬂ

Since the word counts might be dependent. the covariance of all words in the
word neighbourhood has to be computed to obtain V[Nrf(w)] (Section 2.2).

We now calculate the normalized standardized neighbourhood count vector

 

NS 2(1ng .1952 , ...,rvgw) with
A N5,
N3: “S
HIV II
where ||-|| represents the Euclidean norm. We deﬁne the N2 similarity of

two sequences as the inner product of their normalized standardized word
neighbourhood count vectors:

N2(S1,S2)=<Nsl ,st > (3)
=ZN31 x1932. (4)
weA

As a consequence of the normalization. —1 5 N2(S1,S2)5 1. and S1 2S2 =>
N2(S1,S2)= 1. i.e. equal sequences will always have the maximum pairwise
similarity of 1.

2.2 Calculation of expected value and variance

The N2 score can be computed with Markov models of any order. Here.
we illustrate the calculation of the expected value lE[Nrf(w)] and variance
V[Nrf(w)] assuming a ﬁrst-order Markov model. For clarity. the superscript
indicator for sequence S is omitted in the following. Let the sequences
be modelled by a ﬁrst-order homogeneous stationary Markov chain with
transition probabilities 71(1 , j) (Robin at (11.. 2005). The probability p.(w) that
a word w occurs at a speciﬁc position 1 depends on the probability that the
ﬁrst letter occurs. denoted p.(w[1]) (stationarity of the Markov chain) and
can be calculated as follows:

k
p.(w)=p,(w[1])>< Hn(w[j—1],w[j]).

1:2

With this at hand. we can calculate the expected value lE[N,,(w)] of the
word neighbourhood counts (Robin at (11.. 2005):

EINW/l=(l-k+1)M(W’)-

The variance is important to correct for the dependency of overlapping
words in the word neighbourhood. The variance V[N,,(w)] of the word
neighbourhood counts corresponds to the variance of the sum of the weighted
word counts NW:

with 6 indicating word overlaps:

In the case where w:w’. we have (COV[NW,Nw/] :V[Nw]. The word count
variance can be calculated as follows (Robin at (11.. 2005):

Terms (17) and (11) are costly to compute and have minor effects on the
variance and covariance. In the following. we will therefore neglect those
terms. thereby assuming that the occurrence of non-overlapping words is
independent of the sequence in between (11(w[1])%rr’(w[k],w[1])).

2.3 Implementation and instances of N2

The implementation that we provide for N2 is part of the Squn library
(Doering at (11.. 2008). It requires a set of sequences in .fasta format as
input and returns a matrix with all pairwise similarity scores. The word
length k (default k:5) and the background model order (default 1) may
be chosen manually and the normalized standardized word neighbourhood
counts may be returned to obtain additional information on important words.
The calculation of the scores is divided into two steps. a pre-processing step
and a comparison step.

The pre-processing step is run for every sequence individually.
We estimate the background Markov model. count the words and calculate
the word’s probabilities and covariances. To avoid computing the full
covariance matrix. only required entries are dynamically computed and

stored. We then compute the standardized normalized word neighbourhood
counts. The running time of this step depends on the length of the input
sequences. the Markov model’s order. the word length and the size of the
word neighbourhood. It is linear in the number of input sequences.

In the comparison step. the inner product of the standardized normalized
word neighbourhood counts is computed for all pairs of sequences. The
running time of this step depends on the word’s length and is quadratic in
the number of input sequences.

The most basic instance of N 2. with n(w) : w will be referred to as N 2*. In
our implementation. n(w) may be extended to include its reverse complement

(r6),
MAW) = {W rC(W)} (18)
all words equal to w with one mismatch (mm).
n,,,,,,(w) : {w’ ldisthm,,,,,mg(w, w’) <: 1} (19)
or the combination of both (mm, rc). where
nmm,rc(w) : {W/, rc(w’)|disth,,,,,,,,mg(w, w’) <: 1} . (20)

In the following. we will refer to these instances as N2". N2”””. N2”""’”.
The word count of w (and its reverse complement when selected) is always
weighted with aw : 1. for all other words 14/ in n(w) an alternative weight
aw/ may be chosen. The weights for mismatch neighbourhood counts are
indicated in superscript. we use aw/ : 1 (N 2”""(1‘0)) if not stated otherwise.
Note that in Equations (19) and (20) our neighbourhood deﬁnition only
covers direct neighbours. not neighbours of neighbours.

2.4 Other methods

The simplest score between two sequences S1 and S2 is obtained by
calculating either the euclidean distance (Blaisdell, 1986) or the inner product
(Lippert at (11.. 2002) of the word count vectors NS 1 and NS2 as deﬁned in
Equation(1). Both methods are called D2 and have been applied to biological
data (Carpenter et (11.. 2002; Hide at (11.. 1994). Here we focus on the latter
version using the inner product:

D2(S1,S2):<NSI,N52 >

= 23Nﬁl >< N52 .

w EA

D2 is directly dependent on the length of the sequences. it can therefore not
be used for comparing sequences of different length.

The D2 z-score (D2z) was proposed to obtain a standardized D2 score for
which the signiﬁcance can be estimated (Kantorovitz at (11.. 2007):

D2(51152)—1E[D2(51152)]
x/VID2(51 152)]

The expected value for D2 has been studied for approximate word matches.
and upper and lower bounds for the variance have been calculated (Burden
at (11.. 2008). This work is largely of theoretical nature for Bernoulli
background models and no implementation is provided. and therefore we
could not integrate this work into the analysis (Section 4).

The D2" score (Reinert at (11.. 2009) standardizes the word counts instead
of the inner product. Similarly to N 2. D2" is deﬁned as the inner product
of the standardized word counts as shown in Equation (3). but in this case
n(w) only contains w itself. and the background model is computed on the
concatenation of both sequences.

Let p.(w) be the probability of w. the expectation ofNﬁ is then estimated by
lE[N$] :(1—k+ 1)p.(w). The authors assume a Poisson distribution. which
implies that the variance is equal to the expected value. D2" was originally
proposed with a Bernoulli background model for the computation of p.(w).
Here. we extended this score to use Markov background models of higher
order. For the purpose of pairwise comparison. the D2. D2" and D2z scores
have been implemented in the Squn library (Doering at (11.. 2008) and are
part of the executable that is available online.

Similarity of regulatory sequences

 

2.5 Estimating the background Markov model

Calculation of the expected value and variance of the word counts assumes
that we know the background model that describes the sequence. For N 2.
we estimate the background model separately for every sequence. This
allows us to precompute word probabilities and variances (Section 2.3)
leading to a great reduction in computational costs. Since CpG dinucleotides
in mammalian genomic sequences are very rare (Gardiner-Garden and
Frommer. 1987). a Bernoulli background model is insufﬁcient to estimate
word probabilities. This can be seen on simulations. where the ﬁrst-order
Markov model consistently outperforms the Bernoulli model across all
methods (Supplementary Table $1). The optimal order for the Markov
background model for enhancer sequences is an unknown function of
organism complexity and sequence length. Due to the limited size of
enhancer sequences. estimating higher order Markov models likely results
in overﬁtting and poor estimates. Our analysis will therefore rely on a ﬁrst-
order Markov chain as background model for all methods throughout this
analysis.

2.6 Masking repeats

Repeats such as SINE elements have a substantial inﬂuence on
pairwise scores. We use the UCSC pre-masked genome sequence [hg19.
RepeatMasker (www.repeatmasker.org). TandemRepeatsFinder (Benson.
1999)] in order to hide those repetitive elements. Any repeat-masked
sequence is split into a set of repeat-free subsequences by cutting out all
repeat regions. Words are counted in this set such that no artiﬁcial words
are created by concatenation. We use (number of counted words)+k— 1 as
an estimation of the length of the repeat-free sequence. Repeat-masked
sequences are treated equally for all methods. Note that this is slightly
different to the original method proposed for D2z. which introduced artiﬁcial
words by concatenating sequences.

3 RESULTS
3.1 N2 can be computed quickly

Genome-wide datasets consist of many thousand regulatory
sequences. The computation of pairwise similarities needs to be
efﬁcient for large-scale usage. We estimated the running time of
each score on sets with various numbers of sequences where we
computed the matrix of all pairwise similarities (quadratic number of
scores computed). The methods show strong differences in practise
(Fig. 1), butN 2 and its variants are always faster than the other scores
with a statistical model for realistically Chosen numbers. Computing
pairwise scores for 5000 enhancers with k=6 takes 2h for N2*
(4h for N2”, 20h for N2”’”"”), it takes about 42h for D2* and
91 h for D21.

The computation of N2 is dominated by the pre-processing
step, which scales linearly in the number of sequences since the
neighbourhood counts are calculated once for every sequence in
advance (Fig. 1, Table 1, Section 2). In contrast, D21 and D2* cannot
pre-compute normalized counts like N2, and scale quadratically
in the number of sequences. D2z calculates z-scores on pairs of
sequences which are not pre-processed (Kantorovitz et (11., 2007),
and D2* calculates the background model on the concatenation of
sequences that cannot be pre-computed (Reinert et (11., 2009). While
this is likely to increase the accuracy of the model, running times
are drastically higher. Computing pairwise scores for realistically
large datasets is therefore nearly impossible for both D21 and D2*.
This makes the N2 score very attractive for large-scale applications
such as Classiﬁcation of regulatory sequences, or applications that
support pre-computed data structures such as database searches.

3.2 N2 is robust against single sequence noise

Ideally, the pairwise score between two sequences should reﬂect
the sequences’ similarity. However, in practise, word count-based
methods can be heavily inﬂuenced by noise speciﬁc to individual
sequences, meaning that some sequences will intrinsically have high
(or low) scores (Lippert et (11., 2002; Reinert et (11., 2009). Without
proper correction, the pairwise score is an attribute of the individual
sequence rather than of the pair of sequences. This is especially
prominent for D2, where a high number of occurrences of a repetitive
self-overlapping word (such as AAAAA) in one sequence will always
induce high pairwise scores. To quantify the inﬂuence of single
sequence-speciﬁc noise on pairwise scores, we studied the behaviour
of D2, D2z, D2 and N2 for scoring pairs of unrelated sequences
simulated by the same background model. We calculated scores for
all sequence pairs (Si,Sj) for 500 such unrelated sequences. We
Chose a threshold 1 to select the top 5% highest scoring sequence
pairs (high scoring pairs). For every sequence Si, we calculated the
number of high scoring pairs Ci: Ci=Zj1(score(Sl-,Sj)31). Since
all sequences were generated by the same model, the expected value
of Ci, lE(C,-), is equal for all sequences Si. Here, 5% of the 499
sequence pairs of S,- are expected to have a score greater than I,
thus lE(C,-)=24.95. As as reference, we calculated C={C1,...,C,-}
when we randomly assign scores to sequence pairs. This method
is not inﬂuenced by the sequence at all and therefore recapitulates
the expected behaviour for the unrelated sequence pairs (Fig. 2,

scores for 500 sequences generated by the same model were calculated. C,
measures the number of sequence pairs for sequence S, among the highest
5% of all scores (high scoring pairs). Since all sequences were created
using the same model. the distribution of C :{C1,...,Ci} from alignment-
free methods should be similar to the distribution of C obtained from a
random scoring method (‘expected’. black line). A different distribution
would indicate that the number of high scoring pairs is strongly dependent on

black line). We then calculated C for the four alignment-free
sequence comparison methods.

The distribution of C when N 2* is used is Close to the expected
distribution for unrelated sequences (Fig. 2). This shows that N2
is robust against single sequence-speciﬁc noise as the numbers of
high scoring sequence pairs are not inﬂuenced by the individual
sequences (see Supplementary Figs S1 and S2 for N 2’ C and
N 2mm’r C). In contrast, D2 and D21 show a very different distribution
of C from the expected behaviour in the non-uniform case. Figure 2B
shows that the number of high scoring pairs strongly varies,
suggesting that the expected number for C,- is different for every
sequence Si, even though all sequences were generated by the
same model. This shows that the number of high scoring pairs
detected with these methods is strongly inﬂuenced by the individual
sequence, indicating that pairwise scores measure the individual
sequence composition and not the similarity of the sequence pair.
Prior work comparing regulatory sequences using alignment-free
methods did not consider this effect (Dai et (11., 2008; Kantorovitz
et (11., 2007). The above results conﬁrm that neither the D2 nor the
D2z-score should be applied to real biological sequences (Lippert
et (11., 2002; Reinert et (11., 2009).

Other sequence noise such as repeats and stretches of low
complexity occurs frequently in genomic data. N2 is more robust to
this type of noise than D2* and D21 due to its correction for word
overlaps and normalization of counts (Supplementary Table S2).
Our analysis suggests that N2 should be used when repeat-masking
is not an option.

3.3 Simulation studies

To test the performance of N2 on simulated data, we randomly
generated sequences with a similar dinucleotide content as the
mouse genome (Thomas-Chollier et (11., 201 1) (mm9) as background
sequences (negative set). We then implanted m randomly Chosen
motifs of length 5 r times into the same background sequences to
simulate CRMs (‘positive set’; m1r8: m=1, r=8; m4r2: m=4,
r=2). Following (Kantorovitz et (11., 2007), we computed all
pairwise scores for the corresponding negative and the positive
sets. The pairwise scores from the negative and the positive sets
were combined and ranked. Based on this ranked list, we evaluated
the performance of the above methods for pairwise sequence
comparison using the area under ROC curve (AUC ROC) and area
under precision—recall curve (AUC PR). We further estimated the
interpolated precision at 5% recall which we term 5% precision
for short. Results show average values over 25 simulations, each
time drawing 100 random sequences of length 1000 bp and inserting
random motifs, thus covering different motif compositions in an
unbiased way. We tested the performance counting words of size
k=6 using a ﬁrst-order Markov model for word probabilities (see
Supplementary Tables S3 and S4 for k: 5).

We simulated two different settings to evaluate the performance
of the neighbourhood concept of N 2. First, we implanted randomly
sampled 5mers into the forward and backward strand of the
sequences to simulate the orientation independence of binding sites
in CRMs. We speciﬁcally designed the N 2’ C variant for this scenario
and, indeed, N 2’ C performs best (Table 2). Second, we randomly
sampled words and implanted these with one mismatch at a random
position to simulate more ﬂexible motifs. The N 2mm variant was
designed for this scenario as it considers the word neighbourhood for
the similarity. In these simulations, the N 2’”’” variant with mismatch
weights (1w: 1.0 shows the best performance, demonstrating the
value of neighbourhood counts to score sequences with approximate
word matches (Table 3, see Supplementary Figs S3 and S4 for
different Choices of (1w). These simulations conﬁrm the value of
extending exact word count methods to word neighbourhoods.

3.4 Pairwise comparison of tissue-speciﬁc enhancers

The above simulations demonstrated the ability of N2 to distinguish
artiﬁcial CRMs from unrelated sequences. Currently, our knowledge
on regulatory sequences is limited and simulations can only

approximate the real nature of enhancers. Tissue-speciﬁc enhancers
in mouse embryos have been identiﬁed in a genome-wide manner
using the co-activator protein p300 (Blow et (11., 2010; Visel et (11.,
2009). These datasets allow us to test whether alignment-free
methods are able to discriminate in vivo identiﬁed enhancers that
show similar activity from genomic background. We used enhancers
active in forebrain, midbrain, limb and heart tissue of the developing
mouse embryo as positive sets (Blow et (11., 2010; Visel et (11., 2009).
We compared pairwise scores from these tissue-speciﬁc enhancers
with pairwise scores from genomic sequences of the same length
randomly sampled from the mouse genome, ensuring a maximum
of 30% of repetitive sequence for every negative sample. To obtain
accurate estimations, we calculated the average over 25 samples,
each time drawing 500 sequences from the positive set. Using the
same evaluation measures as in the previous section, we tested the
ability of alignment-free sequence comparison methods to detect
ﬁinctional similarity of regulatory sequences.

The Choice of parameters will inﬂuence the results obtained
from alignment-free comparisons. For N2, the main parameters
are the length of the k-mers k and the weights of the
words in the neighbourhood (aw). We therefore tested k=4,5,6
and mismatch weights (1w = {1,0.75,0.5,0.25,0.1,0.05,0.01,0.001}
(Supplementary Figs S5—S8). This analysis indicates that (1w should
be larger for higher values of k where the expected number of k-mer
occurrences is <1. While different parameters might improve results
for different datasets (Kantorovitz et (11., 2007), we selected k=6
and mismatch weights of 1 as reasonable parameters throughout the
analysis to have a consistent and comparable setup.

Figure 3 and Table 4 show the results for pairwise comparison
of tissue-speciﬁc enhancers with alignment-free methods. Across
all tissues, N 2mm(1‘0):r C gives the best results, demonstrating
that N2 is most suitable to detect tissue-speciﬁc activity of
regulatory sequences. The results also conﬁrm the value of the
word neighbourhood concept: comparing N2“ with N2* shows
that the neighbourhood extension to the reverse complement is
always preferable (Table 4). Extending the word neighbourhood to
all words with one mismatch (N2mm(1‘0):rc) further improves the
results by 6—15% (Table 4). These results support the usage of N2
with word neighbourhood counts to score the similarity of regulatory
sequences.

Tissue-speciﬁcity 0f enhancers. The above results indicate that
tissue-speciﬁc enhancer sequences indeed have a similar word
content. However, a comparison of ChIP-Seq data with randomly
sampled genomic sequences might be biased towards measuring
similarities introduced by the technology, such as similar GC content.
To test this, we veriﬁed whether we can discriminate enhancers
according to the tissue where they drive expression. For that purpose,
we computed all pairwise scores of enhancers active in the same
tissue (positive set) and all pairwise scores between enhancers active
in other tissues (negative set), discarding all enhancers active in
multiple tissues. To correct for length differences between datasets
from different tissues, we selected 750bp in the middle of the
reported enhancer sequences. Figure 4 shows that tissue-speciﬁc
enhancers can be discriminated by alignment-free methods (see
Supplementary Fig S9 for the other datasets). While the performance
decreases compared to using random sequences as the negative set,
these results show that activity in a similar tissue is indeed reﬂected
in a higher sequence similarity. gain, the neighbourhood extensions
of N2 improves the results, further highlighting the value of this
concept for regulatory sequences.

4 DISCUSSION

In this study, we showed that N2 improves alignment-free sequence
comparison through its ﬂexible extension to word neighbourhood
counts, thereby covering approximate and orientation-independent
word matches. Previously, the D21 score has been extended to allow
for approximate matching words using estimates for the expectations
and the variances based on a Bernoulli background model; however,
no implementation is available (Burden et (11., 2008; Forét et (11.,
2006). The framework that we present here is much more general
and powerful. We allow for any desired word neighbourhood and
associate words with weights such that the signal of words matching
exactly is not lost. Furthermore, N2 can be computed on any
background model order, which is essential to properly describe
genomic sequences. Finally, N2 is much faster than D2z even
without approximate matching, suggesting that a z-score calculation
for an approximate D2 score would be infeasible for any dataset of
realistic size.

Enhancers active in different tissues were used as the background set.

The differences between N 2* as used in this study and D2* are
mainly due to the estimation of the background model. The better
performance of D2* suggests that the concatenation of the sequences
improves the accuracy of the background model; however, it
drastically increases the running time. Here we observe that the
improvement due to the extension to the word neighbourhood (N 2*
versus N2mm’rc) is better than the improvement due to different
background model estimates (N 2* versus D2*, Table 4).

With simulation studies we showed that N2 performs well on
the task it was designed for, namely ﬁnding similarities between
sequences based on shared words. Importantly, N2 is also able
to measure similarity of in vivo identiﬁed enhancer sequences.
This allows us to verify and increase our understanding of the
architecture of regulatory elements: word count-based similarity
measures are able to detect tissue-speciﬁc activity of enhancers,
suggesting that CRMs contain scattered binding sites that contribute
to their tissue speciﬁcity. Extending the word neighbourhood to the
reverse complement (N 2’ C) improves the performance, showing that
binding sites can occur on both strands of the CRM. Extending
the neighbourhood to words with one mismatch (N 2’ mm") further
improves the performance on experimentally identiﬁed enhancers.
This suggests that there are subtle signals like a common content
of similar but not equal words which are Characteristic of genomic
enhancers.

In this work, we assume that a high number of shared words
represents a similar binding site content of enhancers. This
assumption is violated by repeats, having a high number of shared
words only due to high sequence similarity. For this reason, we
mask repeats before calculating pairwise scores. Although some
transcription factor binding sites have been found in repetitive
sequences (Kunarso et (11., 2010; Zemojtel et (11., 2009), the sequence
similarity of repeats is largely unrelated to regulatory activity and
will eclipse any shared word count from common DNA binding
motifs. We therefore recommend the usage of repeat masked
sequences when comparing regulatory elements.

The N2 similarity can be applied to other tasks than pairwise
comparison. Alignment-free methods have been used to predict
CRMs in ﬂies and mouse (Kantorovitz et (11., 2009). Our results
on pairwise comparison of enhancers suggests that the N2 similarity
could as well be used to predict the regulatory outcome of enhancers.
In contrast to pairwise comparison, where we only rely on two
sequences, prediction would allow to use training data, therefore
we expect that the performance would improve for this task.
Nevertheless, the large size of mammalian genomes limits prediction
of regulatory sequences in a genome-wide manner due to an
inevitable large number of false positive predictions. Among the
applications where N2 might be very insightful are Clustering and
Classiﬁcation of regulatory sequences obtained from genome-wide
studies using transcription factor or co-aCtivator binding data (Lee
et (11., 2011), DNase hypersensitivity sites or enhancer-speciﬁc
histone modiﬁcations.

5 CONCLUSION

In this study, we have presented N 2, a novel alignment-free measure
of sequence similarity that overcomes the limitations imposed by
traditional exact word count-based methods. We have included
the general concept of weighted word neighbourhood counts and
shown that it improves the ability to detect similarity between
regulatory sequences. The task of pairwise comparison of regulatory
sequences is much harder than traditional pairwise alignment since
only very few shared words might lead to a similar activity. We
have demonstrated on a large-scale dataset of mammalian enhancer
sequences that pairwise sequence similarity of non-homologous
regulatory sequences is able to estimate similar in vivo activity. We

are therefore getting closer to understanding the sequence-dependent

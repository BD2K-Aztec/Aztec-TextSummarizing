Abstract

Summary: Functional Gene Networks (FGNet) is an R/Bioconductor package that generates gene
networks derived from the results of functional enrichment analysis (FEA) and annotation cluster—
ing. The sets of genes enriched with specific biological terms (obtained from a FEA platform) are
transformed into a network by establishing links between genes based on common functional an—
notations and common clusters. The network provides a new view of FEA results revealing gene
modules with similar functions and genes that are related to multiple functions. In addition to build—
ing the functional network, FGNet analyses the similarity between the groups of genes and pro—
vides a distance heatmap and a bipartite network of functionally overlapping genes. The applica—
tion includes an interface to directly perform FEA queries using different external tools: DAVID,
GeneTerm Linker, TopGO or GAGE; and a graphical interface to facilitate the use.

Availability and implementation: FGNet is available in Bioconductor, including a tutorial.

1 Introduction

Due to the increasing number of omic studies, efficient functional ana—
lysis of large lists of genes or proteins is essential to understand the
biological processes in which they are involved. Functional enrich—
ment analysis (FEA) is the most popular bioinformatic methodology
to obtain significant functional information from sets of cooperating
genes. FEA methods search in biological databases (such as Gene
Ontology and KEGG pathways, among others) and use statistical test—
ing to find biological terms and functional annotations that are signifi—
cantly enriched in a list of genes. However, in most cases the results of
these analyses are very long lists of biological terms associated to
genes that are difficult to digest and interpret. Some tools cluster the

FEA results, like DAVID-PAC (Huang et (11., 2009) and GeneTerm
Linker (Fontanillo et (11., 2011), but their output is provided as large
tables and there are not many tools to integrate and visualize these re—
sults. Here we present Functional Gene Networks (FGNet), an R/
Bioconductor package that uses FEA results to perform network—
based analyses and visualization. The main network is built by estab—
lishing links between genes annotated to similar functional terms. In
this way, FGNet generates and provides a network representing the
links and associations between the clusters of genes and enriched
terms. The network summarizes and facilitates the interpretation of
the biological processes significantly enriched in the initial list of
genes, revealing important information such as: distance and overlap

GeneCodis with GeneTerm Linker (that returns metagroups, Mg) DDN i 3 3 ; DDN i g i 3

and TopGO (that only returns gtsets) (Alexa et (11., 2010). The pack—
age can be also applied to the results from other EA tools, as long as
the input results are transformed into tables of genes and associated
terms.

2.2 Construction of the functional network

The functional network is built based on the analysis of all the gtsets
provided by the FEA tool. These sets allow to generate a boolean ma—
trix M of genes by gtsets, in which each element mgﬁs : 1 if gene g is
in set 5. This membership matrix is then transformed into an adja—
cency matrix A n X n; being n the total number of genes and at,- the
number of gtsets s in which a gene—pair is included: a,”- :
Z(m,-,S >< mi75)(1 — 5,3,), where 5 is a Kronecker delta (5,,- : 1 ifi:/',

S

5,3,- : 0 if i 9E i). This adjacency matrix is used to generate the func—
tional network by establishing a weighted link between each pair of
genes (g,, g,) in which ah,- # 0. Finally, the clustering of gtsets provided
by the FEA tool is used to generate a second genes’ adjacency matrix
with the number of common clusters/metagroups (Fig. 1A), that is
used to define and allocate gene groups. The network produced is pro—
vided as an igrap/o object for further analysis, and can be exported to
other network—based tools like Cytoscape.

2.3 Visualization and plots of the functional network

The main plot of the network presents the functionally associated
genes (Fig. 1B). Edges link the genes that are in the same gtsets.
Nodes within the same Cl/Mg are placed together using a force—
directed Frnchterman—Reingold layout, within a common back—
ground colour. Genes in only one Cl/Mg are plotted with the colour
of such group, while genes that are included in more than one Cl/
Mg are left white.

2.4 Analysis of functional modules in the network

To facilitate the analysis and quantification of the modules and the
overlap between groups, FGNet also provides a distance matrix and
a heatmap (Fig. 1C), plus an intersection network (Fig. 1D). The dis—
tance matrix is calculated based on the pairwise binary distance in
the adjacency matrix of common Cls/Mgs. These distances are
analysed by hierarchical average linkage and plotted as a heatmap
that reveals the proximity and similarity between the groups of
genes (Cls/Mgs). The intersection network is a bipartite network
which includes only the genes associated to several Cls/Mgs (white
nodes in Fig. 1B,D), showing their connectivity to such Cls/Mgs.
This intersection network facilitates the identification of multifunc-
tional genes. (For more details see FGNet documentation in
Bioconductor).

3 Example of use

We applied the method to several datasets and confirmed that the
functional network greatly facilitates the analysis of enrichment re—
sults. Figure 1 shows the results of FGNet for a list of 175 genes

differentially expressed in human samples of entorhinal cortex
neurons from Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients (obtained from
Gene Expression Omnibus database, GEO: dataset GSE4757).
Performing a FEA through GeneTerm Linker, we obtained six meta—
groups that we labelled according to their main annotations: (Mg1)
cell adhesion; (Mg2) voltage—gated ion/potassium channels; (Mg3)
axon and cell projection; (Mg4) dendrite and neuronal cell body;
(Mg5) synaptic neuroactive ligand—receptor interaction and (Mg6)
MAPK signaling and Alzheimer. The network of these six Mgs (Fig.
1B) provides a global overview of the functionally overlapping genes
and allows to identify hub genes that interconnect groups. For ex—
ample, CNTNAP1 and NLGN4X appear as hubs in Mg1.
CNTNAP1 (that regulates distribution of K+ channels) links Mg1
and 2; and NLGN4X (that facilitates synaptic neurotransmission)
links Mg1 with 4 and 5. NLGN4X is the gene with highest between—
ness centrality in this network. Another important hub is APOE, re—
cently associated to Alzheimer. The distance matrix (Fig. 1C) allows
to quantify the similarity between gene groups, showing that the
closest Mgs are 3, 4 and 6, sharing eight nodes. This is also pre—
sented in the intersection network (Fig. 1D). Finally, the functional
network can reveal further information about some Mgs. For ex—
ample, if a Mg shares many genes with several other Mgs, it will in—
dicate that such Mg brings the most common features that define

the studied biological state. This is the case for Mg6, which, in fact,
is annotated to Alzheimer’s Disease.

Abstract

Summary: Seq2pathway is an R/Python wrapper for pathway (or functional gene—set) analysis of
genomic loci, adapted for advances in genome research. Seq2pathway associates the biological
significance of genomic loci with their target transcripts and then summarizes the quantified values
on the gene—level into pathway scores. It is designed to isolate systematic disturbances and com—
mon biological underpinnings from next—generation sequencing (NGS) data. Seq2pathway offers
Bioconductor users enhanced capability in discovering collective pathway effects caused by both

coding genes and cis—regulation 0f non—coding elements.

Availability and implementation: The package is freely available at http://www.bioconductor.0rg/

1 Introduction

Functional gene-set analysis (fGSA) improves biological interpret-
ability of genomic features with respect to prior knowledge and has
led to important biological discoveries (Khatri et (11., 2012). Its
power lies in the fact that it detects statistical significance over an
entire dataset of gene-sets and yields biologically meaningful inter-
pretations (Subramanian et (11., 2005). Recently, researchers revealed
driver pathways that predispose individuals to disease (Vandin
et (11., 2012) and shed light on the development of targeted therapy
(Gonzalez—Perez et (11., 2013) by performing fGSA on genes prox-
imal to significantly disease-associated loci. However, with the
increasing growth of genomic sequencing measurements, non-
coding regulatory loci pose a critical challenge to fGSA, as nearly
99% of the nucleotides in the human genome do not code for
proteins but instead richly harbor functional regulators of genes
(Kellis et (11., 2014).

‘Gene-based’ fGSA methods neglect non-coding regulatory infor-
mation because they have no readily annotated gene function and
cannot be assigned to a specific biological pathway. For example,

a popular tool for discovering cis-regulatory regions before any sub-
sequent fGSA, links genomic loci to only the nearest genes (Wang
et (11., 2011). Other fGSA algorithms take into account single-
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) only located in or near coding genes
(Koster et (11., 2014; Nam et (11., 2010) or exonic mutations (Boca
et (11., 2010; Gonzalez—Perez et (11., 2013; Leiserson et (11., 2013).

‘Sequence-derived’ fGSA regarding the functional impact of not
only coding genes, but also non-coding regulators, is necessary. A
growing body of evidence supports the strategy of connecting gen-
omic loci and coding genes using a many-to-many mapping and con-
sidering long-distance cis-regulation. First, non-coding regions
richly harbor functional regulatory elements in humans (Kellis et (11.,
2014; Schierding et (11., 2014). Second, nearly half of the disease-
associated SNPs are located in gene deserts (Visel et (11., 2009).
Third, our recent study suggests that a disease-associated SNP
located in an intron could be the enhancer of a neighboring gene ra-
ther than of its host gene (van den Boogaard et (11., 2014).

The first sequence-derived fGSA method is GREAT (the
Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool) (McLean et (11.,
2011). GREAT quantifies an fGSA score by determining if the total

SNPzT) to the results of GREAT (Binomial FDR< 0.05, observed
regions >3, region fold enrich >2). We applied a search ra—
dius : 5 kb for both methods. The valuable biological processes ob—
tained only with seq2pathway include GO:0001701 (in utero
embryonic development) that was predicted recently (Fig. 1) in a
comprehensive study on human height (Wood et al., 2014).

When we applied seq2pathway to RNA—seq data, individualized
gene—set profiles allow the derivation of statistics at the pathway
level directly rather than at the gene level. The advantages of seq2—
pathway lie in noise and dimension reduction, its desired biological
interpretability, as well as a platform for novel integrative systems
biology analysis (Yang et al., 2015a)

4 Conclusion

It is a breakthrough in genome analytics coordinates to assign region
significance scores such as binding affinity estimates from ChIP—Seq
onto a uniform gene—set scale. This feature facilitates the integrative
analysis of multiple datasets (Yang et al., 2015a). The most critical
issue in functionally interpreting genomic loci is to bridge non—
coding regions with gene function. Seq2pathway offers the capacity
to discover collective pathway effects caused by long—distance
cis—regulation of non—coding elements. Importantly, seq2pathway
enhances an alternative tool to integrate a number of ‘omics’
datasets into a condensed space of quantitative gene—set scores.
This functional level integration will help generate assumptions,
constraints, and interpretation in systems biology.

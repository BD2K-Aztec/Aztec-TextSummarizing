ABSTRACT

Motivation: Identification of transcriptional regulatory networks
(TRNs) is of significant importance in computational biology for
cancer research, providing a critical building block to unravel disease
pathways. However, existing methods for TRN identification suffer
from the inclusion of excessive ‘noise’ in microarray data and false-
positives in binding data, especially when applied to human tumor-
derived cell line studies. More robust methods that can counteract
the imperfection of data sources are therefore needed for reliable
identification of TRNs in this context.

Results: In this article, we propose to establish a link between
the quality of one target gene to represent its regulator and
the uncertainty of its expression to represent other target genes.
Specifically, an outlier sum statistic was used to measure the
aggregated evidence for regulation events between target genes
and their corresponding transcription factors. A Gibbs sampling
method was then developed to estimate the marginal distribution
of the outlier sum statistic, hence, to uncover underlying regulatory
relationships. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method,
we compared its performance with that of an existing sampling-
based method using both simulation data and yeast cell cycle
data. The experimental results show that our method consistently
outperforms the competing method in different settings of signal-
to-noise ratio and network topology, indicating its robustness for
biological applications. Finally, we applied our method to breast
cancer cell line data and demonstrated its ability to extract
biologically meaningful regulatory modules related to estrogen
signaling and action in breast cancer.

1 INTRODUCTION

Identiﬁcation of transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) is
essential to understanding the functional roles of molecules and the

mechanisms of complicated biological processes. In cancer research,
those identiﬁed regulatory networks, also referred to as regulatory
modules, can give insight into important biological pathways that
drive the development of disease, based on which novel drugs
or therapies may be developed. In addition to high-throughput
microarray techniques that proﬁle the entire transcriptome of cells,
more speciﬁc information about regulation can be obtained from
protein—DNA interaction data derived from DNA motif sequence
analyses or ChIP-on-chip experiments. Binding motif is also called
transcription factor binding site, a segment of DNA regulatory
sequence, to which a speciﬁc regulatory protein binds preferentially.
ChIP-on-chip experiments can provide whole-genome analysis of
binding site locations of all regulatory proteins. Both binding motif
data and ChIP-on-chip data provide an initial structure of the
unknown network topology. The availability of the above techniques
has promoted extensive researches on regulatory networks in the last
decade and some of which are quite successful in applications such
as yeast studies.

Early exploration in gene modules depends heavily on
statistical methods such as principle component analysis (Alter
et al., 2000) and independent component analysis (Lee and
Batzoglou, 2003). These statistical methods have strong assumptions
that the components are mutually orthogonal or statistically
independent, which can hardly be satisﬁed in real biological
systems. Other statistical approaches include dynamic Bayesian
networks (Friedman et al., 2000), probabilistic Boolean networks
(Shmulevich et al., 2002) and similarity-based methods (Hempel
et al., 2011). In particular, Hempel et al. (2011) has performed
a comparative analysis using 21 different measures and 6 scoring
schemes, investigating their ability in reconstructing gene regulatory
networks. Many of the earlier mentioned methods either utilize
information from gene expression data alone (i.e. do not utilize
prior network knowledge from protein—DNA binding data) or are
infeasible for learning large network structures (Chickering, 1996).
On the recent integrated use of gene expression data and binding
data such as ChIP-on-chip data, Liao et al. (2003) proposed a
computational method called network component analysis (NCA),
which is based on a log-linear model of the relationship between
mRNA abundance and transcription factor activity. Subjected to
some mild identiﬁability conditions referred to as NCA criteria, the
NCA method can be used to effectively estimate hidden transcription
factor activities. Chang et al. (2008) later developed a fast version
of the NCA method with a closed-form solution by using matrix
factorization techniques.

Robust identification of TRNs

 

Despite the earlier mentioned promising progress made for gene
regulatory module identiﬁcation, two major concerns need to be
ﬁirther addressed. First, microarray gene expression data are often
corrupted by noise, and the situation is even worse in real microarray
data acquired from patients with cancer. Second, protein—DNA
binding data, derived from either ChIP-on-chip experiments or
motif sequence analyses, often contain false-positive and false-
negative connections, ﬁirther complicated by the discrepancy
between binding afﬁnity and true regulation. Recent studies show
that transcription factors regulate their target genes in a condition-
speciﬁc manner, i.e. the regulation is not only determined by the
potential of binding strength but also depends on the environmental
condition. To address these concerns, especially regarding false-
positive connections in the binding data, Brynildsen et al. (2006)
showed that by selecting only a subset of genes with high conﬁdence,
a signiﬁcant increase in the ﬁtting performance can be achieved
and more variations in gene expression data can be explained.
Based on the concept of network versatility, Brynildsen et al.
used ‘condition number’ (CN) (i.e. ratio of the largest eigenvalue
to the smallest eigenvalue) of expression matrix to measure the
consistency between the target genes; however, the robustness of
CN is not guaranteed; as a matter of fact, it degrades quickly as
noise level increases or network topology becomes denser (see
Supplementary Material S5), thus limiting its further applications
to cancer studies.

As such, more robust methods are needed in order to correctly
infer condition-speciﬁc gene regulatory modules from noisy data
sources. In this article, we propose a new Gibbs sampling-based
method for target gene identiﬁcation and regulatory network
reconstruction. Our method is capable of reducing false-positives
contained in binding data by iteratively selecting the highly
conﬁdent genes from an initial pool. In particular, a novel statistic
for testing the conﬁdence of target genes, namely outlier sum
(OS) of regression t-statistic, is speciﬁcally designed to pin-down
conﬁdent target genes; based on this statistic a Gibbs sampling
strategy is utilized to sample target genes in a high probability
as governed by the underlying distribution. This Gibbs sampler on
OS statistic is an effective and robust approach to gene regulatory
module identiﬁcation because of the following features: (i) the
regression t-statistic is a effective metric to statistically measure the
dependency of genes and works particularly well when signal-to-
noise ratio (SNR) is low; (ii) the OS of regression t-statistic reﬂects
the aggregated evidence of the regulation between one transcription
factor and its target genes; (iii) the Gibbs sampling scheme allows
us to study the marginal conﬁdence of the target genes, which may
be regulated by multiple transcription factors; (iv) in addition to
target gene identiﬁcation, a procedure of signiﬁcance analysis is
also incorporated into our scheme to test the statistical signiﬁcance
of transcription factors being studied.

Experimentally, we have tested the OS-based Gibbs sampler
on both simulation and yeast cell cycle data to demonstrate its
effectiveness and efﬁcacy. We compared the performance of our
method with a sampling method based on CN under different
SNRs and network topologies. The results showed that our
method exhibited an increasing advantage for regulatory network
identiﬁcation over the competing method as the SNR decreases.
The performance also remained robust when the network topology
became denser or more false-positive connections were introduced.
We then applied our Gibbs sampler to breast cancer cell line data

2 METHODS

Our Gibbs sampling method based on OS statistic aims to reliably identify
regulatory networks consisting of transcription factors and their target genes.
Figure 1 shows the workﬂow of our proposed sampling-based framework.
The Gibbs method starts from the initial topology (A) of the TRN by
selecting a pool of candidate target genes for each transcription factor.
Regression analysis among the candidate gene expression X is performed
and the regression t-statistic is then aggregated into an OS. A Gibbs strategy
is adopted so that we can sample genes according to their marginal OS
of regression t-statistic. After the sampled distribution is converged. both
transcription factors and their target genes can be ranked for regulatory
module reconstruction. Moreover. a statistical procedure based on OS
statistic is designed to test the signiﬁcance of transcription factors. which
can help us prioritize some important regulatory modules for real biological
studies.

2.1 A log-linear model for regulatory network
identiﬁcation

The expression levels of genes in live cells are controlled by many activated
regulatory proteins in the form of transcription factor activities (TFAs) as
binding to the promoters of the genes. Liao at al. (2003) have modeled the
relationship between gene expression level and TFA as a log-linear model
that can be written in the following compact form:

E=A><P, (1)

where E is an N X M gene expression matrix and A is an N X L connectivity
matrix representing the regulation strength of a regulatory network. Here.
P(with a size of L X M) is a matrix representing the unknown TFAs.

The log-linear model of transcription regulation depicts a bipartite network
constituted by transcription factors and their target genes. An initial skeleton
of the network can be constructed from binding data such as ChIP-on-chip
data and motif information. For a given transcription factor. we deﬁne a
group of genes with binding potentials above given threshold as ‘candidate
genes” or ‘candidate pool”. However. due to experimental imperfections and
the gap between binding ability and true regulation. the initial skeleton
or ‘snap-shot” of the regulatory network deﬁned by the candidate genes
contains a lot of false connections. Among all the candidate genes for a
given transcription factor. those true target genes. with supporting evidence of
gene regulation from both gene expression data and proteiniDNA interaction
data. are referred to as ‘foreground genes”; on the other hand. the term.
‘background genes”. refers to those genes whose gene expression shows
little evidence to support true regulation but are included in the initial
regulatory network (due to experimental error or technological deﬁciency
in proteiniDNA interaction data). It is reasonable to assume that the TFA

estimation based on foreground genes is more reliable than that from the
entire population of genes or a group of initial target genes contaminated
by background genes. Hence. identiﬁcation of foreground genes becomes a
crucial step for reliable reconstruction of gene regulatory modules. With a
group of highly conﬁdent genes with strong regulatory evidence from both
gene expression and binding data. we can assess the signiﬁcance of any given
regulatory module in a condition-speciﬁc manner. while gaining an improved
estimation of the activity of transcript factors regulating the network.

2.2 Target gene identiﬁcation based on regression
model and OS statistic

The log-linear model in equation (1) states that a foreground gene”s
expression is a direct result from activities of corresponding transcription
factors. Therefore. we can use foreground genes” expression to indicate
hidden TFAs. Suppose that we assign L foreground genes. [61,92,...,63].
each to represent one unique transcription factor. These L ‘representatives”
are referred to as ‘seed genes” or ‘seeds” for the L transcription factors. We
can write the expression of any candidate gene as linear regression form in
terms of the seed gene expressions as follows:

y=Xi3~ (2)

where y denotes expression of the candidate gene. X: [x]. x2....xL] is the
expression of the L seed genes. 13 = [131,132, . . .ﬁL]T is the scalar coefﬁcient
vector. Under some mild assumptions. it can be derived that 13,» = 0 indicates
that gene y is not regulated by TF i (see Supplementary Material S3). Hence.
we can conduct a signiﬁcance test on 13,. to determine whether a gene is
regulated by TF i. The least square estimate of 13 (Montgomery. 2006) is
given by 3: (XTX)_”XTy= CXTy. Note that we also denote C=(XTX)_l
in the earlier equation. The hypotheses for testing the signiﬁcance of any
individual coefﬁcient 13,» are as follows:

H0(null hypothesis):ﬁi =0; H1(alternative hypotheisis) : 13,» 750.

A suitable test statistic for the earlier hypotheses is given by

b M—L—l 'Cii

 

where SSRzyTy—ETXTy (squared sum of residuals) and M—L—l is the
degree of freedom. Ci, is the ith diagonal element of C =(XTX)_1. The
test statistic deﬁned in equation (3) is a conditional function. testing the
signiﬁcance of regression between gene y and seed gene 9,» for TF i. based
on the seed genes selected for other transcription factors. If the absolute
value of t is larger than a given threshold (e.g. 1.96. corresponding to 95%
conﬁdence level in Gaussian approximation). it means that candidate gene
y is a foreground gene with signiﬁcant regression effect on seed gene 9,»
conditioned on other seeds; otherwise. gene y is more likely a background
gene.

The regression test discussed earlier can be utilized to identify foreground
genes in the candidate pool for given transcription factors based on selected
seed genes. However. we do not know beforehand whether the L seed genes
are foreground genes or not. Fortunately. we know that there are multiple
foreground genes in the candidate pool. which suggests that we can use
foreground genes to support each other. Assume that the candidate pool.

genes are denoted as set $117; the background genes are denoted as set (Dig;

a random gene Qik e @,(1 5 k SKi) as seed gene 9,» and carry out regression
analysis between each single gene in 8, (except Qik itself) and the L seed
genes [91,...,9,_1,9,=9,,,,9,+1,...,QL]. Using the remaining candidate genes

null distribution very well because a background gene should not have a
strong regression relationship with either true target genes of TF i or other
background genes.

To determine whether a seed gene for TF i is well selected (which means
Qik is a true target gene). we propose to use the OS statistic (Tibshirani. 2007)
of Qik as follows:

OS=lele'1(llk/'l—’a/2,M—L—1)~ (4)

where I (x) = 1 whenx 30; I (x) = 0 otherwise. Equation (4) shows that for any
selected seed Qik of TF i. we will sum up all tkj that are ‘outliers” to the null
distribution using a threshold ta/2,M_L_1. If the selected Qik is a foreground
gene. the corresponding OS statistic should be signiﬁcantly larger than 0.
Contrarily. the 05,} will be close to 0 if Qik is a background gene. The OS
statistic represents a conditional test of the quality of a selected seed for TF i .
given L— 1 seed genes for other transcription factors. which will be further
discussed in the next subsection.

2.3 A Gibbs sampler on the OS statistic

The OS statistic deﬁned in the previous section is speciﬁcally designed to
test the signiﬁcance of a seed 9,» by evaluating its suitability to be a true target
gene of TF i based on other seeds. Hence. we can View the OS statistic as a
conditional function as follows:

OS|9,=fOS(9M,...,9,_1,9,+1,...,9L), (5)

wherefoso denotes the test function of OS. From equation (5). we can see that
the power of the OS statistic is inﬂuenced by the quality of the other seeds
61-0 2 1, . . .,L, j 75 i). If the conditional seeds for other transcription factors are
contaminated by background genes. the performance of test statistic z from
regression analysis may degrade. consequently weakening the power of the
OS statistic. Hence. the OS statistic that we seek for TF i should be preferably
deﬁned only by the seed genes of TF i. i.e. a desirable. univariate function
foswi) instead. However. there is no effective way to directly derive foswi)
from equation 5 analytically. Fortunately. we can use a Monte Carlo strategy
to convert the conditional function deﬁned in equation (5) into a probability
density function as follows:

where K0 is an unknown normalization constant (see Supplementary
Material SI for more details). Consequently. we can re-interpret
the problem of calculating foswi) as how to estimate the marginal
probability distribution. [7(9,»)[o<o<0S (60]. from the conditional distribution
p(9i|61,...,9i_1,6i+1,...,9L). In particular. we can estimate the marginal
density p(6i) by employing a Gibbs sampling strategy (Casella and

where t denotes the tth step in the sampling iteration process. At iteration
t. we will sequentially sample one seed gene for each TF based on
the corresponding conditional probability density function. After we have
sampled one gene for TF i. the seed for this transcription factor will be
updated by the newest sample. Through a sufﬁcient number of sampling
iterations. we will have a group of samples that are drawn from the marginal
distribution of seed genes for each TF. From equation (6). we know that
during the sampling procedure. we are also estimating the marginal function
of the OS statistic because it equals to the probability density function
except a normalizing constant. This means that genes with larger marginal
probability density have consistently larger marginal OS. Hence. we can
approximate the empirical probability density function of p(6i) by calculating
the frequency of the samples. The candidate genes for 9,» with large frequency
count are more likely the true target genes for TF i. Note that the convergence
of Gibbs sampler is theoretically guaranteed and number of iterations needed
before convergence has been recommended based on real data analysis
(Supplementary Material S2).

Besides for target gene identiﬁcation. one advantage of the proposed Gibbs
sampling method is that it can facilitate to identify true (active) transcription
factors. OS statistic is an index showing the possibility that one gene is a
true target gene for given TF. If one TF is a background (inactive) TF that
presumably does not regulate any target genes. the test statistic 1 will hardly
be signiﬁcant between any two of its candidate genes. As a result. the OS of
all the candidate genes should be close to 0. On the other hand. if one TF is
a true regulator. the true target genes of this TF should support each other
and yields large OS. Hence. the OS-based sampling method can prioritize
both transcription factors and their corresponding target genes to reconstruct
regulatory networks from gene expression and binding data.

2.4 Signiﬁcance test of identiﬁed transcriptional
regulatory modules

Our Gibbs sampling method is designed to extract a conﬁdent set of
target genes through a probabilistic manner for condition-speciﬁc regulatory
module identiﬁcation. However. when working on the real microarray data
such as breast cancer data. we need strong statistical evidence to support and
justify the identiﬁed regulatory modules before we can proceed to conduct
costly biological experiments for validation. To address the concern that the
results obtained from certain dataset is not by chance. we propose a workﬂow
to test the statistical signiﬁcance of any given regulatory module based on
the OS distribution associated with the corresponding transcription factor.
We summarize the procedure for testing the signiﬁcance of the regulatory
module of TF i as follows:

(1) Generate a null distribution of the regression t-statistic from the entire
gene set being studied. denote as N1.

(2) Suppose TF i has n candidate target genes in the initial pool. Generate
the null distribution of the OS statistic of size it based on N1. denote
as N2,”

(3) Test whether the sampled distribution for TF i has the same mean as
the null distribution N2,” The statistical signiﬁcance (i.e. P value) is
conventionally denoted as [7,».

Through this signiﬁcance test procedure. we are able to highlight the modules
with strong evidence supporting regulation events under certain condition by
both microarray data and binding information. More detailed information
regarding the signiﬁcance test on regulatory modules is provided in the
Supplementary Material S4.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Simulation and yeast data

We ﬁrst tested our sampling method on simulation data to assess
its performance for target gene identiﬁcation. We used Matlab
functions to synthesize an initial network that consists of ~200
target genes each with 30 experiments and 20 transcription factors
with linearly independent TFAs. Among all the target genes, one-
half of them are foreground genes whose expression are generated
according to equation (1) to guarantee the linearity, while for the
other half, namely background genes, we randomly generate their
gene expression proﬁles for this experiment. We compared the
performance of our proposed sampling method for target gene
identiﬁcation with an existing Gibbs sampling method that is based
on CN evaluation (Brynildsen et (11., 2006). As demonstrated in
this article, the competing method outperforms traditional model-
ﬁtting methods (e.g. Ordinary Least Squares; Huber, Cauchy and
Fair weighted robust regressions) by reducing the over-ﬁtting to
background genes. We evaluated the algorithm performance based
on several simulated datasets with different SNRs. Figure 3a shows
the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for target gene
identiﬁcation using the two Gibbs samplers based on OS and CN,
respectively.

From Figure 3a, we can see that for different SNRs (5, 2 and
0 dB), our OS-based sampling method consistently outperforms
the CN-based sampling method with a 0.1 increase in area-under-
curve (AUC). When SNR decreases to 0 dB, the CN-based sampling
method performs slightly better than random guess (AUC = 0.5),
while the OS-based sampler still maintains a reasonable performance
with the AUC of 0.695.

For a more realistic simulation of transcription regulatory
networks, we use the SynTReN software (Van den Bulcke et al.,
2006) to generate synthetic networks and gene expression proﬁles.
SynTReN extracts sub-networks from known yeast networks and
utilizes Michaelis-Menten and Hill kinetics to model the interaction
kinetics. The main difference between the expression data generated
by SynTReN and those by equation (1) is that SynTReN models the
expression of target genes as a nonlinear function of the expression
of their regulators, which is a more realistic representation of
biological regulation relationships than equation (1). The network
topology and expression data generated by SynTReN are better
mimic of the real TRNs than simple linear combinations. We
generated a network consisting of 100 foreground genes and 100
background genes regulated by 24 TFs in total. We also set different

levels of experimental noise to test the robustness of our proposed
method against the quality degradation of gene expression data.
Figure 3b shows that as the noise level increases, both methods
suffer from performance degradation by a corresponding decrease
in the AUCs. However, under the same noise condition, our OS-
based sampling method consistently performs better than the Gibbs
sampler based on CN with an average AUC increase of 0.1
(Supplementary Tables S5 and S6).

To ﬁirther demonstrate its improved performance, we compared
GibbsOS to four other existing methods [i.e. rank correlation
(Hempel et (11., 2011), linear angle regression (Efron et (11.,
2004), FastNCA (Chang et (11., 2008) and COGRIM (Chen et (11.,
2007)] on SynTReN-simulated networks. Both ROC and precision-
recall analyses were performed; the results have demonstrated
that GibbsOS consistently outperforms the existing methods when
different levels of noise are introduced (see Supplementary Material
S6 for more details).

We also applied the GibbsOS method to Spellman”s yeast cell
cycle data (Spellman et (11., 1998) for ﬁirther algorithm validation.
The experimental results are detailed in the Supplementary Material
S7 (Table S7); many important transcription factors associated with
different cell cycle phases were identiﬁed, and their target genes are
functionally enriched in cell cycle-related biological processes (note
that we used the Gene Ontology term ﬁnder from Saccharomyces
Genome Database for ﬁinctional enrichment analysis). These results
have clearly showed that our GibbsOS approach can discover more
signiﬁcant clusters associated with mitosis, cell cycle regulation and
processes than the CN-based sampler can.

3.2 The impact of network topology and false-positive
connections in prior knowledge

As mentioned in the Introduction section, protein—DNA interaction
data have imperfections with certain false-positive and/or false-
negative rate. In this article, we focus on addressing the problem
of ﬁltering out false-positive connections as obtained from ChIP-
on-chip or binding motif data. Speciﬁcally, we aim to separate
foreground genes from background genes by integrating gene
expression data and protein—DNA interaction data. A high false-
positive rate in ChIP-on-chip data means that in the initial candidate
pool, a large number of candidate genes are background genes.
Following the simulated studies in Section 3.1, we systematically
studied the inﬂuence on the performance as the density and false-
positive rate in initial network topology varied in a certain range.
We compared the performance of GibbsOS method with that of the
CN-based method for regulatory network identiﬁcation.

Figure 4 shows the ROC comparison result on simulated networks
with different false-positive rates. Note that a parameter, nfznb,
is used to control the proportion of foreground genes contained
in the initial candidate pool. More detailed information regarding
the comparison study can be found in Supplementary Table S8.
From Table S8, we can see that our proposed GibbsOS method
is quite robust against the increased number of background genes
in initial topology by sustaining a reasonable AUC of 0.86883,
when the actual proportion of false-positives (PFPs) in the network
reaches 87% (nf:nb 8 1:8). Comparatively, we also see that GibbsOS
outperforms the CN-based method in our simulation setting.

Besides the PFPs, network topology will affect the performance
of the proposed method for regulatory network identiﬁcation

and the CN-based method (b), when false-positive rate in the initial topology
increases. ‘nf:nb” is a parameter used to control the ratio of foreground genes
and background genes. ‘nfznb = 1:1” means that the number of foreground
genes is equal to that of background genes

through other factors such as network size (cardinality), network
degree (connection density) and number of transcription factors. To
comprehensively evaluate the robustness of our GibbsOS method,
we studied the ROC/AUC performance under three typical network
conﬁgurations with different network sizes and degrees (as shown
in Supplementary Fig. S14). The majority of genes in Network
A have degree 1 or 2, which means that the overall network
topology is quite sparse. The average degree in Network B increases
to more than 3 and Network C is densely connected with an
average degree of ~5. Network A and C are similar to the example
networks in (Boscolo et (11., 2005), and network B is similar to
the example in (Tran et (11., 2005). We have carried out a quite
comprehensive study to evaluate the robustness of GibbsOS on
these synthetic networks that differ in size, average degree, PFP
and number of transcription factors. The detailed results can be
found in Supplementary Material S8 (Figs. S 15—S 16 and Tables S2—
S3); the experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed
GibbsOS method maintains a reasonably good power for regulatory
network identiﬁcation (AUC > 0.8). GibbsOS only shows minor
performance degradation as the topology of network becomes denser
or the number of background genes increases (see Supplementary
Material 58).

4 BREAST CANCER DATA

We applied our Gibbs sampler to two breast cancer cell line
datasets to identify regulatory modules associated with two different
estrogen-associated conditions: estrogen induced (Creighton et (11.,
2006) and long-term estrogen deprived (LTED) (Aguilar et (11.,
2010). The estrogen-induced dataset consists of three estrogen-
dependent breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, T47D and BT—474)
treated with 17ﬂ-estradiol (E2 or estrogen) in vitro over a time
course ranging from 0 to 24 h. The original paper reported four
E2-induced clusters with clear over-expression patterns at different
starting or ending points. The LTED MCF-7 dataset contains eight
time points ranging from day 0, when the cells were ﬁrst cultured in
media depleted of estrogen, up to 6 months when the cells are fully
estrogen independent. We used Hierarchical Clustering Explorer to
identify two clusters that are over-expressed or under-expressed

after day 90, which is a critical time point when these (and
other) LTED cell models have recovered from the initial effects of
estrogen deprivation and begin to proliferate again (Aguilar et (11.,
2010; Martin et (11., 2003; Masamura et (11., 1995) (Supplementary
Material S9).

To understand the role that estrogen signaling plays in
transcriptional regulation that leads to estrogen independence, and
ultimately to breast cancer progression, we selected 26 estrogen
receptor (ofﬁcial gene symbol: ESR1) related transcription factors
(Supplementary Material S10). These transcription factors are
known to be directly or indirectly associated with ER signaling and
participate in important cellular ﬁinctions such as apoptosis and cell
cycle regulation. Because comprehensive ChIP-on-chip data are not
fully available for the human transcriptome, we used binding motif
information for these 26 transcription factors to construct an initial
pool of target genes. A threshold (e.g. 10 percentile of binding motif
scores) was used and genes with binding motif scores larger than
this threshold were regarded as candidate targets. To study gene
regulatory modules in a condition-speciﬁc manner, we then divided
the genes identiﬁed in each condition into two groups, namely
‘early up-regulated” and ‘late up-regulated”. We applied our Gibbs
sampler to both groups of genes under different E2 conditions and
identiﬁed signiﬁcant transcriptional regulatory modules associated
with each condition. The P-values of the binding motifs are listed
in Supplementary Tables S9 and S10.

In summary, we observed that ESR1 has strong regulatory activity
in the estrogen-induced condition but is no longer a signiﬁcant
transcriptional modulator in LTED cells, which is consistent with
global transcriptional reprogramming and decreased reliance on
pro-proliferative ESR1 signaling during the acquisition of estrogen
independence. V$AP1_Q2_01, V$AP1_Q4_01 and V$CREB_Q2
were all highly enriched in the early E2 up-regulated condition,
while V$NFKB_Q6_01 had strong regulatory activity under LTED
conditions. The latter observation echoes a recent study in which
up-regulation of NFKB contributes to endocrine resistance in ER-
positive breast cancer cells (Chen et (11., 2010; Pratt et (11., 2003;
Riggins et (11., 2005).

When we compared the early up-regulated group under estrogen-
induced conditions (indicative of the acute response to E2) to
the late up-regulated group under LTED conditions (indicative of
E2 independence), we uncovered several underlying regulatory
networks (Fig. 5). AP1 and ESR1 were uniquely activated under
estrogen-induced conditions while expression of NFKB, TP53 and
CEBPA target genes were associated with the LTED condition.
STAT family transcription factors and SP1 showed strong regulation
under both conditions. For these regulatory networks, the expression
patterns and corresponding motif binding sites of target genes can
be found in Supplementary Material S12. We further obtained
network information of the transcription factors from Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis software. From Figure 5, we can see that ESR1
is extensively connected to other transcription factors in a variety
of ways, indicating its crucial role in mediating transactional
regulation under E2 conditions. ESR1 can either interact with SP1
and TP53 through protein—DNA interactions and protein—protein
interactions, or promote/inhibit activities of NFKB, CEBPA and C-
fos, which is the component of AP1 protein complex. Although
STAT family proteins do not directly interact with ESR1, their
association with the estrogen receptor may be indirectly obtained
from interactions with SP1, NFKB and AP1. Hence, we conclude

Fig. 5. Identiﬁed transcriptional modules and their interactions associated
with different estrogen conditions. Note that the interactions between
different transcription factors were obtained from Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis (IPA) (www.ingenuity.com). AP1 and ESR1 are signiﬁcantly
enriched in early up-regulated estrogen-induced group while NFKB, CEBPA
and TP53 have signiﬁcant regulatory activities with late up-regulated long-
term deprived group. Meanwhile, there is strong evidence showing that
SP1 and STAT family proteins are important mediators for transcriptional
regulation under both groups. Identiﬁed signiﬁcant target genes are listed in
Supplementary Tables S 1175 18

that ESR1 remains highly active under estrogen-induced conditions
while its canonical transcriptional function is weakened in LTED
conditions. Concomitantly, alternate transcriptional pathways are
activated through either direct or indirect crosstalk with estrogen
receptor.

Interestingly, the TRANSFAC motif V$STAT_01 was activated
in all four groups, suggesting that this family of transcription
factors is particularly important in breast cancer progression and
estrogen independence. This is a general STAT-binding motif
that does not preferentially recruit any particular family member.
However, under LTED conditions the family member STAT5B is
the most signiﬁcantly up-regulated, suggesting that this member
of the STAT family is responsible for driving the network in this
setting. This is consistent with the known activities of STAT5B in
breast cancer; a naturally occurring mutant of STAT5B ﬁinctions
as a dominant-inhibitory molecule that blocks ESR1 transcriptional
activity (Yamashita et (11., 2003), STAT5B is an essential target
of BCARl/c-Src signaling in Tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer
(Riggins et (11., 2006), and a constitutively active variant of STAT5B
can independently induce Tamoxifen resistance in ER+ breast cancer
cell lines (Fox et (11., 2008).

Given the apparent importance of STAT5B signaling in this
context, we more closely examined the V$STAT_01 target genes
that our method identiﬁed (Table S16). GCSH (Hungermann
et (11., 2011), CYP1B1 (Angus et (11., 1999; Han et (11., 2010),
CISH (Fang et (11., 2008), and PHB (He et (11., 2008) have all
previously been shown to be either associated with or directly
regulated by estrogen/ESR1 signaling, yet all four of these
genes are strongly up-regulated under late LTED conditions. Our
ﬁndings therefore suggest that STAT signaling via STAT5B may

functionally replace ESR1 activation of key genes that support
the pro-proliferative and/or pro-survival phenotype of LTED cells,
ultimately contributing to the acquisition of estrogen independence
and breast cancer progression.

5 DISCUSSION

Identiﬁcation of transcriptional regulatory modules plays a key role
in understanding the mechanism of cancer progression. However,
intrinsic defects of microarray data and ChIP-on-chip/binding-motif
that caused by noise and the discrepancy between gene proﬁles
and prior binding knowledge make it challenging to correctly
recover hidden regulation patterns. The CN-based sampling method
proposed by Brynildsen et (11. is endeavored to ﬁlter out the
‘background genes” with no regulation patterns but are falsely
introduced by binding data. The CN is deﬁned as the ratio of the
largest eigenvalue to the smallest eigenvalue, which may be affected
by noise because the smallest eigenvalue typically represents the
noise power while the larger eigenvalues represent the signal. Hence,
as SNR decreases, the algorithm suffers from increasingly large
performance degradation. On the other hand, the CN of a gene proﬁle
matrix measures the linear independency of gene expression levels
regardless of which speciﬁc genes having linear dependency. Thus,
the evaluation of the seed gene for a given TF may be impaired by
highly correlated seeds for other TFs.

For more robust identiﬁcation of gene regulatory modules
including both target genes and transcription factors, we propose a
Gibbs sampler based on OS of regression t-statistic. The robustness
of the new statistic against experimental noise in microarray data is
inherited from that the regression t-statistic maintains a reasonable
statistic power when the data are relatively noisy.

In real biological applications such as breast cancer cell line
study, we are fully aware of the fact that a considerable number
of genes may be co-expressed through some unknown mechanism
while only a small portion of them should be the true drivers of
cancer progression under certain condition. By using a signiﬁcance
test on OS, we are able to identify the TFs that have the
maximum consistency between its binding knowledge and the target
genes” expression pattern. We generate different null distributions
associated with different target gene pool sizes to prevent the
algorithm from being biased to TFs with more candidate genes.
However, we are also aware of one limitation of GibbsOS for its
relying on a hard threshold to screen binding data for an initial pool
of target genes. Therefore, the proposed Gibbs sampling framework
is only aimed to address the problem of false-positive connections,
not the one of false-negative connections.

6 CONCLUSION

We proposed a Gibbs sampler to identify condition-speciﬁc
transcriptional regulatory modules based on the OS of regression
t-statistic. By utilizing a Gibbs strategy, we are able to estimate
the marginal distribution of the OS statistic for each transcription
factor and evaluate the signiﬁcance of the corresponding regulatory
module. Our proposed method is aimed to extract the true
target genes through the integration of both microarray gene
expression data and chip-on-chip/binding motif data. The simulation
experiments demonstrated the robustness of the method against
noise and network structures, while we further validated its efﬁcacy

on yeast cell cycle data. Moreover, we showed that our method
could successfully identify important regulatory modules related to
estrogen signaling and action in breast cancer.

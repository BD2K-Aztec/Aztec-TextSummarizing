Abstract

 

Summary: Assessing linkage disequilibrium (LD) across ancestral populations is a powerful ap—
proach for investigating population—specific genetic structure as well as functionally mapping re—
gions of disease susceptibility. Here, we present LDlink, a web—based collection of bioinformatic
modules that query single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in population groups of interest to
generate haplotype tables and interactive plots. Modules are designed with an emphasis on ease
of use, query flexibility, and interactive visualization of results. Phase 3 haplotype data from the
1000 Genomes Project are referenced for calculating pairwise metrics of LD, searching for proxies
in high LD, and enumerating all observed haplotypes. LDlink is tailored for investigators interested
in mapping common and uncommon disease susceptibility loci by focusing on output linking cor—
related alleles and highlighting putative functional variants.

Availability and implementation: LDlink is a free and publically available web tool which can be ac—

cessed at http://analysistools.nci.nih.gov/LDlink/.

1 Motivation

Genome—wide association studies (GWAS) have identified robust
genotype—phenotype associations for a range of disease phenotypes
(Chanock, 2014; Welter et (11., 2014). Linkage disequilibrium (LD),
the non—random association of regional variants due to the low
probability of meiotic recombination, has facilitated GWAS by ena—
bling the search for markers of risk alleles based on the principle of
indirect testing, namely, identification of a proxy for the underlying
variant biologically responsible for the phenotype. This can be ac—
complished with a small fraction of known variants that ‘tag’ other
highly correlated variants. Once disease susceptibility loci are identi—
fied, however, the process of choosing plausible variants to explain
the observed signal requires a careful assessment of all correlated
variants, based on local LD structure. Knowledge of population—
specific LD structure and intuitive bioinformatic tools for

interrogating LD are therefore essential for designing association
studies and localizing functional variants.

Bioinformatic tools are available for assessing LD (Barrett et (11.,
2005; Johnson et (11., 2008), but not specifically designed to winnow
down perspective candidates to putative functional variants.
Existing tools report standard measures of LD with different levels
of functional annotation, but none report which alleles are corre—
lated between two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in LD.
Knowing which proxy allele is correlated with a ‘risk’ allele from a
GWAS associated variant is essential for functional studies, espe—
cially when plausible functional variants are not directly genotyped.
While at times this relationship can be accurately inferred when cor—
relations are high and minor allele frequencies are low, additional
bioinformatic analysis is needed when correlations are modest and
minor allele frequencies approach 0.5. Such analyses can be time

LDlink is a web—based LD analysis tool designed to easily query
pairwise linkage disequilibrium between SNPs. The web—based mod—
ules (LDhap, LDmatrix, LDpair and LDproxy) utilize reference haplo—
types from 26 different population groups in Phase 3 of the 1000
Genomes Project (1000G) (Genomes Project et (11., 2012) to produce
haplotype tables and interactive plots. LDlink fills in current gaps of
existing LD analysis tools by integrating expanded population refer—
ence sets, updated functional annotations, and interactive output to
explore possible functional variants in high LD. A thorough explor—
ation of the variation and linkage structure that exists across popula—
tions should facilitate fine mapping disease susceptibility regions and
assist researchers in characterizing functional variants based on geno—
type—phenotype associations with potential clinical utility.

2 Implementation

Genetic reference data for LDlink originates from the Phase 3 re—
lease of the 1000G (Genomes Project et (11., 2012). The release con—
tains over 5000 haplotypes from individuals spanning 26 ancestral
population groups. Statistical phasing techniques of the genotyped
data allow for the construction of extended haplotypes that are
available for public download from the 1000G ftp site in VCF for—
mat. The genotyped set is complete with all individuals having called
genotypes at every included locus. Sample panel files map each indi—
vidual to their respective ancestral subpopulation of membership.

Ancestral super—populations include African, Ad—mixed American,
East Asian, European, and South Asian. LDlink is ﬂexible to allow
for any combination of super or sub—population as input based on
the investigator’s interest.

The other required input for LDlink modules is reference SNP
(RS) numbers of the query SNPs. An indexed SQL database of dbSNP
version 142 is used to match queried RS numbers with the genomic
coordinates (GRCh37) of the SNPs of interest. Only biallelic SNPs are
permitted for query. SNPs with alleles other than A, C, G or T and in—
sertions or deletions are not supported at this time. Available LDlink
SNP functional annotation output includes dbSNP’s predicted func—
tional effect of variants in coding regions and RegulomeDB scores
(Boyle et (11., 2012) for variants in non—coding or intergenic regions.

Available modules include LDhap, LDmatrix, LDpair and
LDproxy (Fig. 1). LDhap calculates population—specific haplotype
frequencies of all haplotypes observed for a list of query SNPs.
Queried SNPs need not be contiguous and all observed 1000G
haplotypes are enumerated. The LDmatrix module creates inter—
active heat map matrices of pairwise LD statistics from a list of SNP
RS numbers and a specified population. An interactive hover tool
displays LD metrics, correlated alleles, and nearby RefSeq genes.
LDpair generates 2 by 2 tables of observed haplotypes for a pair of
SNPs and reports haplotype and allele frequencies as well as meas—
ures of linkage disequilibrium. The LDproxy module interactively
explores proxy and putatively functional SNPs for a query SNP in a
selected 1000G population. Interactive plots show linkage disequi—
librium over genomic distance where data point size, color and
labels are used to highlight minor allele frequency and predicted

function. Combined recombination rates are estimated from
HapMap data. An interactive hover tool is also available to display
LD metrics, correlated alleles and nearby RefSeq genes. All modules
either require manual entry of RS numbers or uploading a saved list
of RS numbers as well as selection of a 1000G populations of
interest. Interactive output is displayed beneath the input tab and
automatically updates when new input is added. An important
limitation to keep in mind when using the 1000G phased genotype
data is the possibility of switch rate errors, particularly when
querying haplotype information on variants separated by large
genomic distances.

All LDlink modules are written in Python 2.7 and run on a vir—
tual machine with UNIX operating system. Tabix version 0.2.5 is
used to access phased genotypes of query SNPs from indexed VCF
files (Li, 2011). The Python Bokeh package (0.8.0) is used to gener—
ate interactive plots. All web content is programed in HTML5 for
cross platform compatibility.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Next-generation RNA sequencing offers an opportunity to
investigate transcriptome in an unprecedented scale. Recent studies
have revealed widespread alternative polyadenylation (polyA) in eu-
karyotes, leading to various mRNA isoforms differing in their 3’ un-
translated regions (3’UTR), through which, the stability, localization
and translation of mRNA can be regulated. However, very few, if
any, methods and tools are available for directly analyzing this special
alternative RNA processing event. Conventional methods rely on an-
notation of polyA sites; yet, such knowledge remains incomplete, and
identification of polyA sites is still challenging. The goal of this article is
to develop methods for detecting 3’UTR switching without any prior
knowledge of polyA annotations.

Results: We propose a change-point model based on a likelihood
ratio test for detecting 3’UTR switching. We develop a directional
testing procedure for identifying dramatic shortening or lengthening
events in 3’UTR, while controlling mixed directional false discovery
rate at a nominal level. To our knowledge, this is the first approach
to analyze 3’UTR switching directly without relying on any polyA an-
notations. Simulation studies and applications to two real datasets
reveal that our proposed method is powerful, accurate and feasible
for the analysis of next-generation RNA sequencing data.
Conclusions: The proposed method will fill a void among alternative
RNA processing analysis tools for transcriptome studies. It can help to
obtain additional insights from RNA sequencing data by understanding
gene regulation mechanisms through the analysis of 3’UTR switching.

1 INTRODUCTION

The past two decades have witnessed dramatic changes
brought on by high-throughput technology in both statistics
and the biological sciences. Hybridization-based microarray
technology, which emerged in the late 1990s, had been
widely applied by researchers for more than a decade and
led to a myriad of seminal advances. During the past few
years, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has matured as a

more powerful and accurate tool. It is replacing the once dom-
inant microarray technology in all areas of application be-
cause of its affordable cost and highly accurate digital
resolution (Wang et al., 2009). For transcriptome study, the
introduction of RNA-Seq technology along with new analytic
methods makes it possible to address an increasing number of
compelling biological questions that may not be possible using
microarray technology. In particular, alternative RNA spli-
cing and processing, common phenomena in eukaryotes,
play so critical a role in gene function regulation that they
receive much attention in RNA-Seq analysis (Keren et al.,
2010) and motivate quite a few methodological developments.
For example, Mixture of Isoforms (MISO) uses a probabilistic
mixture model to quantify alternative splicing and processing,
and it, then, tests the equality of transcript isoform ratios be-
tween samples (Katz et al., 2010); multivariate analysis of
transcript splicing (MATS), by using a Bayesian statistical
framework, offers the ﬂexibility to identify differential alter-
native splicing and processing events that match a given user-
defined pattern (Shen et al., 2012); DEXSeq uses generalized
linear models to test for differential usage of exons and pro-
vides reliable control of false discoveries by taking biological
variation into account (Anders et al., 2012); other develop-
ments include (Griffith et al., 2010; Rogers et al., 2012;
Trapnell et al., 2013). Despite the success of these methods,
detecting 3/ untranslated regions (3/UTR) switching remains
challenging. Very few, if any, methods and tools are available
for directly analyzing this special alternative RNA processing
event.

The pre-mRNA 3/ end processing plays a crucial role in eu-
karyotic mRNA maturation (Colgan and Manley, 1997;
Proudfoot, 2011). Through cis elements in the 3’UTR of
mRNAs, post-transcriptional gene regulation frequently occurs
and determines the stability, localization and translation of
mRNA (Martin and Ephrussi, 2009; Moore, 2005). These roles
are mediated by interactions with RNA-binding proteins and
microRNAs (miRNAs) (Licatalosi and Darnell, 2010). Over
half of mammalian genes contain alternative cleavage and poly-
adenylation (or polyA) sites, which lead to various mRNA iso-
forms differing in their 3/UTRs (Zhang et al., 2005). Alternative
cleavage and PolyAdenylation (APA) in 3/UTR, including
shortening and lengthening events, have recently been identiﬁed
as global phenomena under different cell conditions (Flavell
et al., 2008; Ji et al., 2009; Mayr and Bartel, 2009; Sandberg
et al., 2008) and different species (Sherstnev et al., 2012;
Smibert et al., 2012; Ulitsky et al., 2012). They have also

Change-point model for 3’UTR switching

 

drawn much attention in cancer studies (Fu et al., 2011; Lembo
et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2012; Mayr and Bartel, 2009).

In contrast with the increasingly recognized importance of
APA, computational methods and tools for the APA analysis
using RNA-Seq are underdeveloped. In unraveling APA regu-
lation, Ji and colleagues scored relative expressions by taking
the ratio of short reads density in extended and common re-
gions, as defined by distal and proximal polyA sites, respect-
ively (Ji et al., 2011). A higher score, therefore, indicated
higher abundance of long 3’UTR isoform. A similar approach
was taken in a recent tandem 3/UTR analysis, where the stat-
istical significance was assessed by Fisher’s exact test for the
switch score under different conditions (Wang et al., 2008).
The same group further improved the approach and imple-
mented a new computational tool, MISO (Katz et al., 2010).
Specifically, tandem 3’UTR was treated as special alternative
processing, and thus the quantification of expression level for
each isoform can be estimated by computing Percent Spliced
Isoform. These existing methods, however, have one critical
drawback, namely, they rely on prior knowledge of annotated
polyA sites. For example, MISO constructs 3’UTR isoform
based on polyA sites information collected from the PolyA
site database (Lee et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2005). It is
noted that the polyA sites from the current database are com-
putationally inferred from cDNA (complementary DNA) /
EST (expressed sequence tag) sequences. It is far from com-
plete and may also contain false-positive findings. Therefore,
these approaches that depend on polyA information may not
be precise or powerful because of incomplete information of
all potential cleavage sites on 3/UTR.

In this article, we propose using a change-point model for
identifying 3’UTR switching. To our knowledge, this is the
ﬁrst available method that allows investigators to directly ana-
lyze 3’UTR length changes without being dependent on polyA
site information. To determine whether a 3’UTR is shortening or
lengthening to a certain extent, we further develop an additional
testing procedure to make directional decisions. We show that
this directional procedure can control the mixed directional FDR
(mdFDR) at a pre-specified nominal level. Simulation studies in
various settings and applications to two real NGS datasets have
demonstrated that our proposed change-point model and the
testing framework are powerful and accurate. The methods de-
veloped in this article have been implemented using Java in a
computationally efﬁcient and user-friendly software package
available from http://utr.sourceforge.net/. This tool will allow
investigators to analyze next-generation RNA sequencing data
in an effective and efﬁcient way.

The rest of the article is organized as follows. First, we intro-
duce a change-point model based on a likelihood ratio test, fol-
lowed by an iterative procedure for computing P—Values. We then
present a new directional testing procedure for identifying dra-
matic shortening or lengthening events while controlling
mdFDR at a nominal level. We perform simulation studies to
investigate numerical performance of the proposed method.
Moreover, we apply the proposed method to analyze two real
RNA sequencing datasets for identifying genes with length
changes in their 3/UTRs. Finally, we conclude and discuss the
results and methods.

2 METHODS

2.1 A change-point model for 3’UTR switching

The 3’UTR switching problem and the change-point model are illustrated
via a toy example in Figure 1. We assume there are two 3’UTR isoforms,
isoform 1 and isoform 2, ending with a distal and proximal polyA site,
respectively. These two polyA sites deﬁne common and extended regions.
We consider expression ratio of the two isoforms across two conditions,
treatment and control, which can be quantiﬁed by the percentage of read
counts from the treatment condition (Fig. 10). We expect a constant ratio
throughout the whole 3’UTR (p, = C, for i: 1,. . . ,T) if the isoform
usages are identical under these two conditions. A ratio change at a cer-
tain position 1: implies a ratio change between the two isoforms, which is
the so-called 3’UTR switching. We wish to test the null hypothesis H,
that the ratio [7,- is constant against the alternative hypothesis that, for
some point I in the 3’UTR, the ratio changes from [70 to [7,,

I70, i=l,...,‘i:—1,
p1, i=1,...,T.

H13Pi=

When the change-point location I is known, e.g. based on isoform know-
ledge if it is available, detecting the change is straightforward. However,
[70, p, and, most importantly, I are unknown in our problem.

We start with a setup for the sequenced reads on 3’UTR with length T.
Let {X , | t< T} be the number of reads whose ﬁrst base maps to the left of
base location t of a given 3’UTR under the treatment condition.
Similarly, let {Y, | t< T} be the number of such reads under the con-
trol condition. We denote m" and my to be the total num-
ber of reads in the treatment and control conditions, respectively. Let
U: {U1, U2, . . . , Umx} and V: {V1, V2, . . ., me} be the event locations
for processes {X ,} and {Y,}, namely, U and Vare the mapped positions of
reads from the treatment and control samples. We let m = m" + my be
the total number of reads combined from treatment and control samples,
and then we obtain combined event locations {W1, W2, . . . , Wm}. We
deﬁne an indicator variable Z,- to denote whether an event is a realization
of the treatment process or control process as follows:

1,1fWiEIU1,U2,---,Umx},
'_ 0,#Wie{V1,V2,...,me}.

For any short read 1' in the combined process, we use the term ‘success’ to
refer to Z,- = 1, that is, the read is from the treatment process. Hence,
following Worsley (1983), we deﬁne a change-point model on the indices
{1, . . . , T} for read counts by the binomial log-likelihood function.
Considering a candidate change point at r, for l < ‘E< T, we have a gen-
eralized likelihood ratio statistic

 

A 1 _ A
A,= Z {Zk xlog@+(l —Zk)xlog 17,0}
kE[1,171] 1’ 1 _p

 

+ Z {Zk xlog&+(l —Zk)xlog1_pf},
kE[1,T] 1’ 1_p

where 150, f), and f) are the maximum likelihood estimates of success
probabilities:

171
I; = k:1Zk A = 21::sz
0 r—l’ ’ T—‘i:+l’
ﬁ:Z[:1Zk
—T .

This is an exact binomial generalized likelihood ratio statistic and can
help to quantify the ratio change. Because the change-point location I is
unknown, we compute the statistic for all candidate loci ‘l.’ = 2,. . . , T-I,
and ﬁnd the one yielding the maximal change. The solution is

i: = argmax A,.

2.2 A general iterative procedure for calculating P—Value

We seek to compute the signiﬁcance P-value for the maximum test sta-
tistic. To this end, following Worsley (1983), we use a general iterative
procedure to calculate how likely the maximum likelihood ratio statistic L
would be less than A;, denoted as Pr(L<A; ), under the null hypothesis.

For the combined process in Section 2.1, let S, and Sk’ be the total
numbers of successes (from the treatment process) at intervals [1, k — l]
and [k, T], respectively, (k =2, . . . ,T— 1). The likelihood ratio test statis-
tic A, depends only on S, and Sk’. Given that S = S, + Sk’, and S = m"
is ﬁxed, A, depends only on S1,.

Therefore, given A; and the test statistics, events of Lk <A; can be
expressed as events of the form ak 5 S, 5 bk for suitable choices of
Gk = inﬂSk ILk<A;} and bk 2 sup{Sk I Lk<A;}. For k = l, . . . , T, we
deﬁne Fk(v) = Pr(ﬂff:1 events of Li<A2 |Sk = v) so that the P-value
can be derived as follows:

(1) Initially, set F1(v) = l, for al 5 v 5 b1.
(2) For 25k 5 T— 1, ﬁnd Fk(v) for ak 5 v 5 bk by

(3) A ﬁnal iteration for k = T at v = S will produce
F T(S) = Pr(L < A2).

(4) The desired probability will be Pr (L 3 A2) = l — Pr(L<A2).

The procedure is based on a dynamic programming approach. Its
working logic is similar to the forward/backward algorithms used in
hidden Markov models (Rabiner, 1989). Because the statistic A, depends
only on Sk, as a naive approach, we may enumerate all possible values

of Sk for each position and consider all combinations S 1S 2. . . ST, then
pick the ones having L<A2 and sum their likelihoods to obtain the
ﬁnal solution Pr(L<A;). Let D be the maximum number of possible
values for Sk, k=1,2...,T, then the computational complexity for
this brute-force approach is 0(DT), namely, exponential in terms of
the problem size T.

In contrast, our algorithm solves this complex computation iteratively.
Fk(v) represents the likelihood that no testing statistics 3 A; can be
found from position 1 to k, given Sk = v. So when k reaches the terminal
point T and v: S, we can obtain the ﬁnal solution Pr(L<A2). To com-
pute Fk(v), we only need Fk,1(.), as illustrated in Supplementary Figure
Sl. Specifically, Fk(v) will assume that u successes are contributed by
Fk,1(u) (namely, sampled from Mk L 1) and the remaining (v — u) suc-
cesses come from mk, whose likelihood is then governed by the hypergeo-
metric function hk(u,v). From the ﬁgure, we know that the
computational complexity for one iteration, as determined by the
number of edges, is 0(D2). The total computational complexity is, there-
fore, O(TD2), namely, linear in terms of the problem size T.

2.3 A directional multiple testing procedure for identifying
dramatic shortening or lengthening events

If the usage of the long isoform increases, we call it lengthening, and if it
decreases, we call it shortening. Identifying shortening or lengthening
events may be critical for downstream analyses, such as analyzing
miRNA target sites. The signiﬁcance we compute in the previous section
is for a two-sided test. That is to say, when the null hypothesis is rejected,
we can only state that there is a change, either lengthening ([3, >130) or
shortening ([3, <130). In practice, on rejecting the null H0, one may often
conclude that the change is either lengthening or shortening based on the
sign of ([3, — [30). There is a chance that this decision strategy will make a
false statement about the sign, which is termed a directional error, or a
type III error (Benjamini et al., 2005). It is desirable to control this error
when making directional conclusions, which may not be negligible when a
large number of tests are conducted simultaneously. In our applications,
we often test for tens of thousands of genes at a time.

In the multiple-testing ﬁeld, it is often argued that an exact null
hypothesis is never true in reality; instead, more likely only signiﬁcant
differences matter (Benjamini et al., 2005; Williams et al., 1999). Here for
our 3’UTR switching problem, small change may happen by chance and
is irrelevant to the phenotype of interest. Dramatic change may be more
robust and easier to replicate. Therefore, focusing on dramatic change is
particularly meaningful, as we often have only one or few replicates in
RNA-Seq experiments.

We propose to use the odds ratio (OR) at the estimated change-point 'E
to measure the change direction and magnitude, reasoning that the pro-
posed method essentially chooses the location that gives the strongest
association in a 2 x 2 contingency table among all possible locations.
Thus, we perform Fisher’s exact test at the estimated change-point i: to
make such directional decisions. We formulate this problem as control-
ling false discoveries within the multiple-testing framework. Using a simi-
lar deﬁnition as in Guo et a]. (2010), we denote the mdFDR to be a
combination of two parts. One is the false discovery rate (FDR), resulted
from the change-point testing procedure. The other is the pure directional
FDR (dFDR), derived from Fisher’s exact test,

 

C F C+F
mdFDR—FDR+dFDR_E{m}  _E{RV1}

where C is the number of falsely rejected true null hypotheses and R is the
total number of rejected hypotheses among H1, . . . , Hm. F denotes the
total number of false null hypotheses among H1, . . . , Hm that are cor-
rectly rejected while at least one directional error has been made when
deciding on the signs of the components.

Change-point model for 3’UTR switching

 

To control mdFDR, the expected proportion of Type I and directional
errors among all the rejections, we propose a directional testing procedure
as follows:

(1) Apply the BH procedure (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) at level
or to test whether there is a signiﬁcant change among all the
m hypotheses.

(2) Let R denote the number of hypotheses rejected.

(3) For every i=1, . . . ,R, perform one-sided Fisher’s exact test for
testing OR>d (d: I).

(4) If Fisher’s exact test has a P-value Pjiwm 5 get, then reject the null
hypothesis.

It is shown that a similar BH procedure using the same two-sided
P-value twice can control the mdFDR at level or (Benjamini et al.,
2005). The directional testing procedure proposed here has its novel ex-
tension in comparison with the BH procedure in Benjamini et a]. (2005).
Speciﬁcally, the same signiﬁcance P-values are reused in testing direction
and controlling directional errors in (Benjamini et al., 2005); in contrast,
our procedure uses an additional one-sided Fisher’s exact test for detect-
ing dramatic change and the rejection is based on these new P-values. We
show in our simulation studies that our new testing procedure can control
mdFDR at the nominal level. It is noted that when d = 1, the one-sided
test determines the direction of 3’UTR changes. The user may set d to be
much larger than 1 to detect genes with more dramatic 3’UTR changes.

3 SIMULATION STUDIES
3.1 Power and FDR evaluation of the change-point model

We ﬁrst present simulation results to demonstrate the perform-
ance of our change-point model. We assume there are two
3’UTR isoforms with different ending polyA sites as shown in
Figure 1. The gene expression ratio before and after the change
point (Fig. 1C) will critically influence how easily the change can
be detected. So we generated the 3/UTR with different expression
ratios under two conditions. Speciﬁcally, under condition 1, the
entire 3/UTR has a constant expression level, whereas, under
condition 2, the expression level was increased by K-fold in the
common region and the extended region remained the same as in
condition 1. Gene expression level was measured in reads per
kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM), Mortazavi et al.,
2008). We simulated two constant expression levels RPKM: 1
and RPKM=2 for condition 1. These two RPKM values are
commonly used for determining expressed genes in RNA-Seq
real data analyses (Ji et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2013). We
assumed that the total number of mapped reads was 100 mil-
lion/sample and the 3/UTR length was 1000 bp. We considered
three possible change points at 250, 500 and 750bp of the
3/UTR. We varied the fold change K in the common region
from 2 to 4 with increments of 0.5. The null distribution was
simulated by setting K: I for estimating type I errors. We simu-
lated 500 3/UTRs with change (K > I) and 500 3/UTRs without
change (K: I) to estimate the power and FDR of our proposed
method, respectively. We set FDR nominal level=0.05. The
simulation was repeated 50 times, and we reported the averaged
power and FDR.

The simulation results are summarized in Figure 2. We see that
FDR was controlled at the nominal level 20.05 in all settings,
suggesting that the proposed method is a valid testing procedure.
Moreover, we find that the fold change, expression level and

change-point position all inﬂuence 3’UTR switching detection.
First, the power of our proposed method increases with the fold
change from small to large. This is expected because the change
is more likely to be detected when the signal becomes stronger.
Second, the power increases when the gene expression level in-
creases. Under the same fold change, the power of RPKM = 2 is
always higher than that of RPKM = 1, suggesting that increasing
the number of reads that are covered in the 3’UTR will also
benefit change detection. Third, the position of the change
point has an impact on the performance too. The change point
in the middle yielded the highest power, compared with the
change points close to the two ends.

3.2 Power and mdF DR evaluation of the proposed
testing framework

We next evaluate the power and mdFDR for the proposed two-
step testing framework. To simulate alternative hypotheses with
mixed ORs, we used similar simulations as above but with the
following modiﬁcations. For the 500 3/UTRs with fold change,
we divided them into two groups with 250 each. The fold change
for the first group is uniformly distributed from 1 to 3, and the
second group is uniformly distributed from 3 to 5. We set d: I
and d = 3 to test the changes with OR >1 and OR >3, respect-
ively. We applied our proposed directional testing procedure at
mdFDR level: 0.05.

As we can see from Figure 3, our proposed testing framework
is able to control mdFDR at the nominal level: 0.05 for all the
settings. Similarly, the power increases when the expression level
doubles from RPKM = 1 to RPKM = 2, and the change point at
the middle position is easier to detect than those closer to the two

Fig. 3. Power and mdFDR evaluation of the directional testing proced-

posed testing framework is capable of controlling mdFDR at the nominal
level. It is easier to capture the 3’UTR switching events when the OR is
higher, the expression level is higher or the change point is closer to the
middle

ends. It is noted that when the hypothesized OR is changed, the
results change accordingly. For example, if we are interested in
detecting the 3/UTRs with OR >3 by setting d :3, the testing
procedure then favors the second group of 3/UTRs with
OR~unif(3, 5) and would not reject the 3/UTRs in the first
group with OR~unif(1, 3). When we set d :1 for testing the
3/UTR changes with OR >1, the 3/UTRs in the group with
OR~unif(3, 5) are easier to detect because the signal is relatively
stronger than that of d = 3. This explains the power difference
between testing OR >1 and OR >3 as shown in Figure 3.
In summary, it is easier to capture the switching events when
the OR is higher, the expression level is higher or the change
point is closer to the middle.

4 REAL DATA APPLICATIONS

4.1 Application to regular RNA-Seq data

We ﬁrst applied our proposed method to analyze regular RNA-
Seq data that have been commonly produced to profile transcrip-
tome changes. MYC is a notable transcriptional factor that has
been frequently activated in many human cancers with profound
cellular inﬂuence. Although MYC-binding sites and target genes
have been documented extensively in the past decade, thanks to
the widespread application of high-throughput technology, the
role of MYC and MYC target genes in androgen-controlled
breast cancer growth remains unclear. To elucidate MYC regu-
latory network in molecular apocrine breast cancers, Ni and col-
leagues used RNA-Seq to proﬁle transcriptome changes before
and after MYC knockdown by siRNA in MDA-MB-453 breast

cancer cells with androgen stimulation (Ni et al., 2013). In sum-
mary, they transfected MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells with
control (siCtrl) or MYC siRNA (siMYC) for 48 h, followed by
treatment with 10 nM DHT (DiHydroTestosterone, the most
potent androgen) or vehicle (veh) for 6h, resulting in three con-
ditions: siCtrl-veh, siCtrl-DHT and siMYC-DHT. High-
throughput 50 bp single-end sequencing was performed on
Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform for each sample, generating total
numbers of short reads ranging from ~26 million to ~39 million.
Following the authors, we made two comparisons, siCtrl-DHT
versus siCtrl-veh and siMYC-DHT versus siCtrl-DHT, but to
detect 3’UTR shortening events instead of gene expression level
changes.

We downloaded the dataset from NCBI (National Center for
Biotechnology Information) Gene Expression Omnibus (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under GSE45202. We aligned the
raw reads to hg19 reference genomes using a conventional
RNA-Seq aligner Tophat (Trapnell et al., 2009) V1.3.1 with de-
fault parameters. Coverage ﬁlter can help to reduce false-positive
findings and is a heuristic strategy commonly used in existing
RNA sequencing tools and analyses. Following MISO (Katz
et al., 2010), we required that each 3/UTR should have at least
20 supporting reads in both samples, leading to 8052 and 7878
genes in the two comparisons, respectively, for further analysis.
Our method was applied to detect shortening events with OR >2
at an mdFDR level of 0.05. We identiﬁed 947 shortening 3/UTRs
in siCtrl-DHT versus siCtrl-veh and 1524 shortening 3/UTRs in
siMYC-DHT versus siCtrl-DHT, respectively, with 461 genes in
common. There are 1063 genes uniquely identiﬁed in the com-
parison of siMYC-DHT versus siCtrl-DHT but not in the com-
parison of siCtrl-DHT versus siCtrl-veh, which may be
associated with MYC knockdown given the DHT treatment.
We describe two examples of signiﬁcant MYC-dependent
shortening events, LDHA and OGDH, on the UCSC genome
browser (Fig. 4), to demonstrate that our proposed method
worked well in detecting such 3’UTR switching without relying
on any polyA annotations. Because of space limitation, we only
displayed the 3’UTR region despite that the actual reads spanned
the whole gene body. We observed a highly non-uniform distri-
bution of data in the 3/UTR, a common phenomenon in RNA-
Seq data, which may be caused by polyA mRNA selection bias
(Wang et al., 2009). We included the polyA track in the genome
browser, which showed the annotated polyA sites (colored bars)
from the PolyA_DB. We observed dramatic changes before and
after the predicted change points. Clearly, the two genes LDHA
and OGDH tend to use the proximal polyA site instead of the
distal site in siMYC—DHT. These change points are also consist-
ent and supported by the polyA sites annotated in the
PolyA_DB. Together, these results suggest that our proposed
method works well to detect 3’UTR switching without relying
on any polyA annotations.

LDHA catalyzes the conversion of L-lactate and NAD to
pyruvate and NADH in the final step of anaerobic glycolysis.
It has been shown to be highly correlated with breast cancer
growth (Wang et al., 2012). OGDH encodes one subunit of the
2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex that catalyzes the overall
conversion of 2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate) to succinyl-
CoA and CO(2) during the Krebs cycle. It also plays an
important role in breast cancer cells (Qattan et al., 2012).

Fig. 4. Examples of two MYC-dependent 3’UTR shortening events. The
vertical lines indicate the estimated change points predicted by our pro-
posed model. We observed dramatic changes before and after the pre-
dicted change points. Clearly, the two genes LDHA and OGDH tend to
use the proximal polyA site instead of the distal site in siMYC-DHT.
These change points are also consistent and supported by the polyA sites
annotated in the PolyA_DB (colored bars in the PolyA_DB and Poly(A)
tracks). Together, these results suggest that our proposed method works
well to detect 3’UTR switching without relying on any polyA annotations

These shortening genes may be worthwhile for further biological
study because the loss of distal region, if containing miRNA
target sites, may help escape degradation destiny or translational
repression.

We further conducted a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
of these 1063 MYC-dependent shortening genes using a hyper-
geometric test. The canonical pathways and Gene Ontology
(GO) gene sets definitions were downloaded from the
Molecular Signatures Database (http://www.broadinstitute.org/
gsea/msigdb/index.jsp). The results are summarized in Table 1
(Canonical pathways) and Supplementary Table S1 (GO gene
sets). It has been suggested that MYC plays a crucial role in
several aspects of cellular function, such as metabolism,
growth, replication, differentiation and apoptosis (Ni et al.,
2013). These pathway results suggest interesting transcription
relevant functions of these 1063 MYC-dependent shortening
genes, such as splicing, intron processing and transcript elong-
ation. These genes are primarily associated with mRNA

processing and gene expression, which are critical in cancer de-
velopment (David and Manley, 2010; Sotiriou et al., 2006). The
original studies (Ni et al., 2013) focused on conventional differ-
ential expression analysis. Capturing 3/UTR switching from the
same RNA-Seq dataset using our proposed method would shed
additional light on cancer transcriptome regulations and suggest
new roles of MYC.

To compare with the existing methods that rely on polyA
annotations for 3/UTR switching analysis, we also run MISO
(Katz et al., 2010; version 0.4.1 with default parameters) to ana-
lyze this RNA-Seq dataset for identifying 3/UTR shortening
events. We ﬁltered tandem 3/UTR events following the MISO
manual as follows: (i) at least one inclusion read, (ii) one exclu-
sion read, such that (iii) the sum of inclusion and exclusion reads
is at least 10 and (iv) the A \11 is at least 0.2 and (V) the Bayes
factor is at least 10, and (i)i(v) are true in one of the two samples.
MISO did not output any tandem 3/UTR events, although it did
report other alternative splicing events, such as skipped exons,
intron retentions, etc. This shows that methods depending on
polyA annotations may suffer from low power in 3’UTR switch-
ing analysis. The capability of our method for detecting 3’UTR
switching will ﬁll a void among current alternative splicing and
processing analysis tools.

4.2 Application to special RNA-Seq data

We analyzed another breast cancer dataset (Fu et al., 2011) to
highlight the ﬂexibility of our proposed method to handle special
RNA-sequencing data. To improve efficiency of capturing APA
sites, Fu et a]. (2011) developed a novel strategy to sequence only
reads with poly(A) tails followed by a linear trend test method
for analyzing APA site switching. Speciﬁcally, they modiﬁed
oligo-d(T) tagged with sequencing primers after polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) to sequence polyadenylated reads. They
performed their SAPAS (Strategy of sequencing APA Sites)
method to proﬁle APA sites of human breast cancer lines and
compared it with normal cell lines, generating in total ~31 mil-
lion short reads with 75 bp length from the Illumina platform.

We downloaded the dataset from the NCBI sequence read
archive (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi; acces-
sion number SRA023826). PolyA containing reads cannot be
mapped to the genome directly. Therefore, we used Bowtie2
(Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) local model to align those
polyA containing reads because this model does not require
end-to-end mapping. We then applied our method to identify
3’UTR shortening events. The authors reported their results at
FDR level: 0.01. To make a comparison, we reported shorten-
ing events at the same mdFDR level of 0.01 for OR >1.
We identiﬁed 972 shortening events in the breast cancer cell
line (MCF_7) in comparison with the control sample
(MCF_10A). Their linear trend test method was conservative
according to the authors and detected only 428 shortened
3/UTRs (Fu et al., 2011). We found that 85% of their shortening
genes were also detected as shortening by our method. The larger
numbers of 3’UTR shortening events we identiﬁed under the
same significance level suggest the higher power of our method.

To demonstrate the accuracy of these findings, we ﬁrst exam-
ined the four genes that were validated in their studies. All the
four genes, DDX5, SEC61A1, HSBPl and FAM134A, were
detected to be shortening in MCF_7 by our method. The short-
enings of these four genes were all experimentally conﬁrmed (see
the PCR results in the Supplementary Material of Fu et al.,
2011). Moreover, Visualization of the identiﬁed shortening
events highlighted the accuracy of our prediction. Figure 5
shows two genes OAZl and SDCl that were missed by the
linear trend method but demonstrated clear shortening patterns.
Both genes are known to be related with cancer (Kastl et al.,
2010; Nikolova et al., 2009). Finally, we conducted the GSEA
for these 972 shortening genes. The results are summarized in
Table 2 (canonical pathways) and Supplementary Table S2 (GO

gene sets). Interestingly, we also found the mRNA splicing path-
way to be the most signiﬁcantly enriched in this breast cancer
dataset, as in the first breast cancer dataset we analyzed in
the previous section. In particular, these genes are related to
spliceosome, a large ribonucleoprotein complex that guides
pre—mRNA splicing in eukaryotic cells. Recent studies have
demonstrated the contribution of spliceosome as a core compo-
nent in oncology (Quidville et al., 2013) and its role in determin-
ing 3/UTR length (Berg et al., 2012). Taken together, these
results indicate the accuracy of our proposed method in captur-
ing 3/UTR switching. Overall, this real data application
highlights the ﬂexibility of our method for analyzing NGS data
that are specially generated to sequence and capture polyaden-
lyation cleavage sites.

5 CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

We propose a change-point model based on a generalized likeli-
hood ratio statistic for identifying 3/UTR length change in the
analysis of next-generation RNA sequencing data. We develop a
directional multiple testing procedure for identifying dramatic
shortening or lengthening events. The numerical performances
of our approach are investigated using both simulated and real
data. The results show that our proposed method is powerful,
accurate and ﬂexible for analyzing various types of next-gener-
ation RNA sequencing data.

Some experimental approaches may measure polyA sites ex-
plicitly, e.g. the one for the breast cancer dataset of (Fu et al.,
2011) we analyzed. They can provide results serving directly to
identify polyA sites. It is noted that detecting polyA sites and
3’UTR switching are two different problems, although related.
Essentially, 3’UTR switching implies polyA site usage change. It
will beneﬁt from the discovery of polyA sites but does not require
this information directly. As a simple strategy, one may first use
an algorithm to identify polyA sites and then apply a simple
approach such as Fisher’s exact test to detect changes.
However, the polyA site discovery step may not be trivial be-
cause of the heterogeneity of the cleavage sites at polyA sites
and/or low coverage at some locations. For example, the authors
of the Fu et a]. (2011) dataset performed a modiﬁed snowball-
like clustering (Tian et al., 2005) and then empirically took the

Change-point model for 3’UTR switching

 

cleavage clusters with more than one read as polyA sites. It may
be complex and non-trivial to optimize such a two-step ap-
proach. In contrast, it is an advantage of our method over
two-step strategies by providing a one-stop integrated solution.

The dynamic programming strategy has greatly reduced the
computational complexity of our algorithm from exponential
0(DT) to linear 0(TD2). In practice, the typical 3/UTR size T
is ~100(%2000 bp. We observed that most legitimate regions [ak,
bk] for Sk have size <150 for the conventional RNA-Seq data
from Ni et a]. (2013) we analyzed. We ran our program on a
computing node with 800MHz CPU and 4 GB memory. It took
only ~6h to analyze the whole dataset of (Ni et al., 2013) for
the two comparisons at the speed of a few seconds/ gene.
Therefore, our program is so efﬁcient that it does not require
high-performance computing facility and can run feasibly on
most computers.

Many genes may have more than two polyA sites. Given more
than two polyA sites, the alternative model (H1) in our method
assuming two polyA sites will fit less well but still better than the
null model H0 assuming one polyA site. The null remains the
same. Thus, our testing procedure remains valid even though it
may not be optimal under some circumstance. In other words,
the actual FDR may be lower than the nominal FDR cutoff
when more polyA sites are involved. Empirically, the user may
use a more lenient cutoff if he feels our procedure is (over) con-
servative. Our method may not always be optimal when the
signal is subtle. For instance, when there are multiple change
points that are all subtle, a more powerful test can be designed
by considering all change points. However, we do not expect
many such instances. Moreover, if they are interested, the users
may manually inspect further those identified genes to see
whether there is more than one change point and where they are.

It is noted that the expression of 3’UTR and its regulation can
be complex. For example, there are transcripts that are solely
composed of 3’UTR (Carninci et al., 2006; Mercer et al.,
2011). Although the development of our tool is motivated for
the need to detect 3/UTR switching, it may also identify changes
caused by such transcripts. Depending on applications, caution
thus should be used with regard to the biology and the interpret-
ation of the identified change points.

The proposed method can be improved in several ways. First,
one limitation is that the current method cannot handle sample
replicates. We may extend it by computing joint likelihood over
multiple samples, assuming the same change point across sam-
ples but allowing [30, [3, and 13 to vary for different sample com-
parisons. Second, we assume there are only two isoforms with
one change point. We may extend it for multiple isoforms with
K > I change points. In principle, we may search similarly for the
K points that yield the most signiﬁcance with computational
complexity of 0(LK), where L is the whole UTR length. We
may further assume K is unknown and determine it using
model selection (Shen and Zhang, 2012). Third, statistical infer-
ence of conﬁdence estimates is as important as point estimates.
For example, the conﬁdence intervals on the estimated change
points could provide more information as needed for some
downstream analyses, such as determining the loss/ gain of
miRNA target sites. This can be obtained based on the values
accepted by a level a of likelihood ratio test (W orsley, 1986).
Fourth, in addition to 3’UTR switching analysis, our proposed

method can also be extended to other applications. For example,
one can merge together the multiple 3/UTRs of a gene, if any, to
perform alternative last exon analysis. Moreover, if input vector
is the coverage of entire exon regions of a gene, our proposed
method can also detect premature cleavage and polyA events,
another set of interesting biological phenomena that has received
much attention recently (Kaida et al., 2010). We are working on
these extensions.

To our knowledge, the proposed approach is the first one to
allow the analysis of 3’UTR switching without relying on any
polyA annotations, one major limitation of existing methods.
The closest existing approximate solution may be those requiring
polyA annotation information, e. g. MISO compared in our ana-
lysis. These existing tools also have the same limitations as our
method, such as not capable of handling sample replicates, not
supporting multiple isoforms and no confidence interval esti-
mates for the change point. These limitations warrant develop-
ment of new bioinformatics methods.

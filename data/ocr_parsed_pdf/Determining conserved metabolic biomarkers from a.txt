Abstract

Motivation: Metabolite databases provide a unique window into metabolome research allowing
the most commonly searched biomarkers to be catalogued. Omic scale metabolite profiling, or
metabolomics, is finding increased utility in biomarker discovery largely driven by improvements
in analytical technologies and the concurrent developments in bioinformatics. However, the suc—
cessful translation of biomarkers into clinical or biologically relevant indicators is limited.

Results: With the aim of improving the discovery of translatable metabolite biomarkers, we present
search analytics for over one million METLIN metabolite database queries. The most common me—
tabolites found in METLIN were cross—correlated against XCMS Online, the widely used cloud—
based data processing and pathway analysis platform. Analysis of the METLIN and XCMS common
metabolite data has two primary implications: these metabolites, might indicate a conserved meta—
bolic response to stressors and, this data may be used to gauge the relative uniqueness of potential
biomarkers.

of regional racism across the United States (Chae et 41]., 2015). With
this in mind and starting from the premise that the majority of users
searching the METLIN database are from the population engaged in
metabolomic studies we set out to use analytics to survey the broad
range of metabolomics research reflected in METLIN search data
and reveal the most commonly encountered biomarkers.

The potential impact of biomarker research is far reaching,
involving diagnosis, prognosis, drug efficacy and the development of
personalized medicine. One particularly intriguing aspect of bio—
marker discovery is the prospect of reducing the overall cost of
health care by increasing the level of medical care through early
diagnosis, or through the development of patient specific therapies
(Davis et 41]., 2009). It is therefore understandable that a significant
effort has been dedicated to the discovery of unique disease—specific
molecules as evidenced by the thousands of biomarker—related
papers (Drucker and Krapfenbauer, 2013; Poste, 2011).

The importance of biomarker discovery coupled to the accessi—
bility of new, high sensitivity analytical technology has contributed
to this broad interest (Poste, 2011), however a lack of standard best
practices has meant that discoveries often have very little practical
value. The thousands of papers that have been published on bio—
markers have yielded relatively little success (Poste, 2011), for ex—
ample while the number of biomarker publications have increased
by over 20% each year, the number of patent applications for
clinical biomarkers remains level (Drucker and Krapfenbauer,
2013). Metabolomics—based biomarker discovery publications are
progressively contributing to this body of work and also show the
same trends, with the exception of the robust inborn errors of me—
tabolism screens, there are relatively few new clinical metabolite
based tests (Xia et 41]., 2013).

Metabolomic experiments, whether they are accomplished
through the use of traditional GC/MS technologies (first demon—
strated in the early 1970s by Linus Pauling and Horning; Horning
and Horning, 1971; Pauling et al., 1971), or current liquid chroma—
tography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) instrumentation, are well
suited for gaining a comprehensive and quantitative view of the
metabolome. These approaches have the ability to detect thousands
of metabolites from biological samples with high resolution, high
sensitivity and a dynamic range typically exceeding four orders of
magnitude (Patti et 41]., 2012). As a result, it is possible to quickly
generate datasets rich in metabolite information.

A typical workﬂow for metabolomics involves several steps;
first, mass spectral data is collected for each sample in each sample
group. Next the data is analyzed by any number of data processing
platforms including Metabolic profiler (Bruker), Simca—P
(Umetrics), Markerlynx (Waters), Mass Profiler Pro (Agilent),
MetAlign (Lommen, 2009), MZmine (Pluskal et 41]., 2010),
MAVEN (Melamud et 41]., 2010), MetaboAnalyst (Xia et 41]., 2012)
and XCMS Online (Tautenhahn et 41]., 2012) to identify the features
that significantly change between sample groups. The significantly
dysregulated features are then given a putative identification by
searching metabolite databases such as METLIN (Supplementary
Fig. S1).

METLIN (Smith et al., 2005) is a highly accessed database used
for metabolite identification. Since its inception in 2004 METLIN
has grown to contain over 240 000 metabolites, 13 000 of which
also have MS/MS data in both positive and negative ionization
modes at four different collision energies (Supplementary Fig. S1).
More than 10 000 users and over 600 citations of the original publi—
cation are indicators of its wide application. In addition, METLIN
has been integrated with XCMS Online, providing metabolite iden—
tifications for the users of this cloud—based data processing platform.

The consistent increase in METLIN use (Supplementary Fig. S1) is
largely due to the wide spread adoption of mass spectrometry as an
exploratory tool by biologists and biochemists. This has been facili—
tated by the increased access to mass spectrometry technologies that
are sensitive and easy to use. Furthermore, the development of user—
friendly bioinformatic platforms and integrated statistical tools
(mentioned earlier) has removed a significant technical barrier
(Gowda et 41]., 2014).

Technology has also leveled the playing field so that researchers
are typically using similar tools, which for the most part are com—
posed of liquid chromatography coupled to an atmospheric pressure
ionization source and either time—of—ﬂight (TOF), quadrupole time—
of—ﬂight (QTOF) or quadrupole orbi—trap (Q—Exactive) mass ana—
lyzers with a consistent degree of quantitative and mass accuracy.
Thus, the masses searched in METLIN provide a representation of
the discriminatory metabolites from metabolomic experiments.
Here, in order to gain a perspective on the metabolites being
searched, METLIN archival data was searched and examined to de—
termine commonly observed metabolites across one million queries.

2 Results and discussion

Researchers using metabolomics are currently investigating a wide
array of biological problems, thus the masses searched in METLIN
should be a reﬂection of the diversity of these experiments.
However, because metabolism is to some extent conserved we also
expect to find commonly dysregulated metabolites to be searched at
a high frequency. This assumption was evaluated using Figure 1,
which provides an overview of database queries that were submitted
by approximately 5000 researchers. This data represents an

aggregate of one million searches that returned METLIN identifica—
tions. Interestingly, while a great diversity of metabolites was
searched, we found that there are in fact preferentially searched
masses. Additionally, over 80% of the searched metabolites fell into
a bimodal distribution between the mass ranges of 150 and 450
(Fig. 1), consistent with small molecules that are measured in metab—
olomics. Because commonly dysregulated metabolite masses will be
detected at high frequency and therefore will be searched more
often, we suggest that the distribution of this ‘mass spectrum’ is a
manifestation of a conserved metabolic response.

The results obtained from our analysis of METLIN searches pro—
duced a list of masses, the number of times each mass has been
searched and the number of metabolite IDs that are returned for
each query as represented by their neutral mass (Fig. 2). The most
frequently searched mass in METLIN was 180.06. We have puta—
tively identified this metabolite as glucose by accurate mass, al—
though this query returns a total of 31 possible metabolites when
using the database’s default mass accuracy of 30 ppm. This example
illustrates an important consideration that is implicit in this kind of
meta—data analysis. Some commonly searched masses might be the
result of the dysregulation of many isomers as opposed to the dysre—
gulation of one common molecule.

Metabolite identification via MS/MS is still obligatory in metab—
olomics if one wishes to classify a metabolite as either a specific or a
nonspecific signal. Indeed, molecule identification is the most crit—
ical aspect of untargeted metabolomics when attempting to under—
stand metabolism. The identification process is outlined in
Supplementary Figure S2 where a search returns possible metabol—
ites based on the input mass accuracy and collision energy and me—
tabolite identification is facilitated by the comparison of research
MS/MS data to MS/MS data compiled in the METLIN database by
matching the precursor mass followed by MS/MS matching based
on x—rank (Mylonas et (11., 2009). METLIN MS/MS searches were
not as frequently performed as accurate mass searches, nor were
these searches stored, we instead mined XCMS Online to facilitate
the metabolite identifications.

To identify core metabolites and further validate (Supplementary
Fig. S2) our assumption that the masses most often searched in
METLIN are related to the most commonly dysregulated bio—
markers, we also searched meta—data generated by XCMS Online.
We were able to cross—compare the METLIN hit list to the most
common biomarkers observed in a subset of 2000 XCMS Online ex—
periments. XCMS Online (xcmsonline.scripps.edu) is a web—based
platform that was designed to simplify the data analysis of untar—
geted metabolomic experiments. In 2012 an email was sent out to
all XCMS Online users with an invitation to participate in this com—
munal effort to identify shared metabolites across a heterogeneous
population of biological specimens and a wide spectrum of pheno—
typic conditions. Participation in this meta—analysis was done on an
opt—in basis only and all data was masked, anonymized and aggre—
gated for statistical analysis. These experiments show that some of
the searched masses are most likely due to the appearance of isomers
for example while glucose searched at a high frequency it was not
commonly dysregulated in real samples.

Using the XCMS data as a guide, we next analyzed a battery of
sample types using LC—MS/MS in an attempt to identify the most
common biomarkers from real samples. MS/MS data for the most
common metabolites encountered in the communal XCMS Online
experiments are presented in the Supplementary Material. From the
100 most frequently occurring metabolites with available MS/MS
data 24 compounds were identified and listed in Supplementary
Table S1, another 24 metabolites were characterized as

phospholipids. MS/MS spectra were available for an additional 52
compounds but these have not been identified yet (all spectra and
tables are available as Supplementary Material). Comparative ana—
lysis across XCMS results and the most common METLIN searches
revealed a significant overlap. We found that all XCMS results, with
exception of 4 metabolites, are within the 90th percentile of the most
searched masses in METLIN and half of those in the 90th percentile
actually fall within the 99th percentile.

The highest ranked identified molecule in Supplementary Table S1
is linoleic acid. This fatty acid is a useful marker for fat intake and me—
tabolism in humans (Arab, 2003). Although, it is interesting that this
molecule would feature so prominently in our list of common metab—
olites as we can reasonably exclude the possibility that a dispropor—
tionate number of XCMS Online users are investigating nutrition. To
understand how often this metabolite is reported as a biomarker we
performed an ISI web of knowledge search for the name of the metab—
olite paired with the word biomarkers. The search produced 273 sep—
arate publications and, following a more detailed survey of the
literature, we found that there are at least 10 different conditions
linked to the dysregulation of linoleic acid.

The published reports coupled to the MS/MS data shed light on
the high occurrence of searches for m/z 281.24. We find that linoleic
acid is a commonly dysregulated metabolite and while there is little
doubt that dysregulation of linoleic acid is discriminatory for all the
reported conditions, we would argue that this property makes lino—
leic acid a relatively non—descript biomarker.

In contrast, METLIN searches corresponding to the biomarkers
choline, betaine and trimethylamine N—oxide amount to a total of
25 searches, and N,N—dimethylsphingosine amounts to 2 search re—
sults. The former biomarkers link diet, and gut microﬂora to cardio—
vascular disease (Wang et (11., 2011) and it might be the number of
complicated natural relationships that keep these molecules off of
the list of the most common dysregulated metabolites. The latter
biomarker, N,N—dimethylsphingosine, is linked to pain (Patti et (11.,
2012) but was only found after it was honed in on using a multi—
group analysis strategy. In this case the experimental design allowed
for the extraction of a subtle metabolite change from the back—
ground of nonspecific responses.

Another observation from these experiments is the number of
unknowns being observed. The XCMS data are summarized in
Figure 3. In this histogram we have plotted the 300 most commonly

observed m/z value

Fig. 3. Observed m/z values and frequency for the 300 most common metab-
olites in the meta-analysis of 2000 untargeted metabolomic experiments
across a heterogeneous population of biological specimens and a wide spec-
trum of phenotypic conditions. The inset shows MS/MS matching the feature
corrisponding to tryptophan

dysregulated m/z values (the white bars indicate contaminant ions
the black bars show identified metabolites the light gray bars are un—
knowns with MS/MS data and the dark gray bars are unknowns
without MS/MS data). The picture given by this plot is that a signifi—
cant number of the metabolite features that are commonly encoun—
tered are unknown. Additionally, we find a large proportion of the
histogram represents known contaminates. This finding underscores
the importance of proper sample handling and the identification of
contamination sources (Weber et al., 2012).

These data are highly dynamic and will evolve with technological
advances and changes in standard procedures. As technology will de—
fine metabolome coverage, it is likely that the current standard prac—
tices will be reﬂected in the METLIN search data. For example a
relatively recent occurrence is the use of hydrophilic interaction chro—
matography (HILIC) separation technologies coupled to mass spec—
trometry (Buszewski and Noga, 2012; Spagou et al., 2010). HILIC is
used for the analysis of polar metabolites as an alternative to the dom—
inant reversed—phase liquid chromatography (RPLC). Indeed HILIC
has been utilized to study central metabolism (Bajad et al., 2006;
Heiden et al., 2010; Ivanisevic et al., 2013). Although RPLC is still by
far the most utilized separation method, therefore METLIN search
data results are likewise primarily driven by RPLC—MS, which gener—
ally involve hydrophobic molecules.

3 Concluding remarks

Overall this METLIN—XCMS data provides an opportunity to exam—
ine which pathways are commonly related to stress responses and
those that reflect more specific responses. For example linoleic acid
had a high search frequency in METLIN and appears in 273 manu—
scripts in the context of biomarkers, a result that is corroborated in
our XCMS experimental results making it a conserved biomarker.
That is to say it is a general marker for a system under stress that is
conserved across many species under various perturbations. By mak—
ing this data available we are hopefully providing other researchers
with a template for biomarker discovery and translation.

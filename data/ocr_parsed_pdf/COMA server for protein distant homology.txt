ABSTRACT

Summary: Detection of distant homology is a widely used
computational approach for studying protein evolution, structure and
function. Here, we report a homology search web server based on
sequence profile—profile comparison. The user may perform searches
in one of several regularly updated profile databases using either a
single sequence or a multiple sequence alignment as an input. The
same profile databases can also be downloaded for local use. The
capabilities of the server are illustrated with the identification of new
members of the highly diverse PD-(D/E)XK nuclease superfamily.

1 INTRODUCTION

The concept of homology (common evolutionary origin) is at
the heart of most studies dealing with protein sequence, structure
and function. In the absence of protein structure, inference of
homology usually has to rely exclusively on sequence data. At
present, most sensitive sequence-based methods use comparison of
multiple sequence alignments (MSA) represented as either Hidden
Markov Models (Madera, 2008; soding, 2005) or sequence proﬁles
(Sadreyev and Grishin, 2003; Wang et (11., 2009). New sequence-
based methods may help in revealing previously unappreciated
evolutionary relationships even for proteins with known structures
(Alva et al., 2010).

With the goal of improving distant homology detection, we
have recently developed a new method (COMA; Comparison Of
Multiple Alignments), based on sequence proﬁle—proﬁle comparison
(Margelevicius and Venclovas, 2010). The new method has at
least two major features distinguishing it from other proﬁle—proﬁle
comparison methods. The ﬁrst feature is position-speciﬁc variable
gap penalties that are more biologically relevant than the ﬁxed
ones. The second one is a global score system leading to improved
estimation of statistical signiﬁcance of detected similarities. The
standalone software implementing the COMA method provides
all the tools necessary for proﬁle search and construction of
custom proﬁle databases, making it suitable for large-scale studies.
However, the use of standalone tools requires a certain level
of expertise and substantial computer resources. Thus, to make
this method accessible for larger biological community, we have
developed a web server. The server is based on the latest version
of the COMA algorithm, which is almost 2-fold faster than the

original one without sacriﬁce in sensitivity. This has been achieved
by the introduction of simple heuristics to ﬁlter out clearly random
matches by requiring several high scoring segments on the same
diagonal of the dynamic programming matrix. The server includes a
number of add-ons for easier analysis and interpretation of homology
search results such as merging alignments of multiple hits and
structure modeling. The portability of the standalone software has
also been improved by changing representation of proﬁle databases
from binary to the text format. Thus, the regularly updated server
proﬁle databases can be downloaded and used locally on different
platforms.

Here, we describe major features of the COMA server and provide
an example of its use for uncovering distant homology.

2 FEATURES AND USAGE

The main server window features a simple and intuitive user
interface for setting-up homology search jobs. The input for the
server is either a single protein sequence or a user-supplied MSA.
If the input is a single protein sequence, the server will use it to
initiate a PSI-BLAST (Altschul et (11., 1997) search against one
of the speciﬁed sequence databases to collect homologs and to
generate a query-based MSA. If the input is MSA. the user can
choose whether to use the alignment to jump start a PSI-BLAST
search or to use it as is for the subsequent construction of the query
sequence proﬁle. The PSI-BLAST run can be controlled by several
parameters. Alternatively, the user may entrust the server to handle
a PSI-BLAST run. In such case, the server will attempt to collect
as many related sequences as possible, while keeping PSI-BLAST
results free from contamination by unrelated sequences.

The actual homology search is done by comparing query-
based sequence proﬁle constructed from the corresponding multiple
sequence alignment against the selected proﬁle database (at present
SCOP, PDB and PFAM). The user can choose the E-value cutoff
and the maximum number of resulting alignments to be displayed
in the output. In addition, there are a number of advanced options
for controlling the construction and comparison of proﬁles. These
options may be useful for expert users.

Instead of waiting for homology search results in the interactive
mode the user may bookmark the link to the web-page, where the
results will be displayed, or may choose to receive the html link to
the results by e-mail upon completion of the speciﬁed job. Every
completed job is stored for a certain period of time (presently one
month), during which the user has unlimited access to the results.

The structured output of the homology search (see Supplementary
Fig. l) is provided on the web page and includes (i) summary of the
input data and job parameters, (ii) an overview of the proﬁle hits in
color-coded graphical representation and (iii) query-hit alignments.
The output gives a concise information regarding structure, function

and other relevant information for reported hits. Hits are linked to
original databases (PDB, SCOP or PFAM) and to the search results
within the collection of PubMed articles using annotation of hits as
keywords.

The output is enriched with additional functionality. The user may
extract the combined alignment between the query and any number
of hits for further analysis. If the search was performed against PDB
or SCOP, the server provides a possibility to generate a 3D model
of the query based on the corresponding alignment.

3 EXAMPLE OF NOVEL HOMOLOGY DETECTION

To illustrate the utility of the COMA server for distant homology
detection, we describe the discovery of new evolutionary links to
the highly diverse PD-(D/E)XK nuclease superfamily.

Using COMA to query individual PFAM families against a
custom-made proﬁle database of PD-(D/E)XK representatives,
we noticed that the Rail family (PF08652) has produced
intriguing results. The absolutely conserved D and EXK motifs
within the Rail family were aligned to the active site motifs
of PD-(D/E)XK representatives hinting at possible evolutionary
relationship. Using recently solved structures for Rail family
members (Schizosaccharomyces pombe Rail and mouse Dom3Z)
(Xiang et (11., 2009) we could directly assess this hint. DaliLite
(Holm et al., 2008) searches with Rail/Dom3Z structures against
PDB indeed found PD-(D/E)XK proteins as the best matches
with signiﬁcant Z-scores (e.g. A exonuclease was detected with
Z-score=4.7). The analysis also revealed that Rail/Dom3Z have
the structurally conserved core characteristic of PD-(D/E)XK
nucleases including all three active site motifs (Fig. 1). To explore
this relationship ﬁirther, we constructed MSA for the conserved
Rail/Dom3Z sequence region (e.g. 181—345 in mouse Dom3Z;

search against structure databases (SCOP and PDB; Supplementary
Figs 1 and 2). Server not only detected A exonuclease as a top
hit with the signiﬁcant E-value (<10T4), but also aligned all three
active site motifs in agreement with DaliLite. Taken together, these
results make a convincing case for homology between the Rail
family and PD-(D/E)XK nucleases. The novelty of this ﬁnding is
underscored by the fact that the determined Rail family structures
were considered to represent a new fold (Xiang et al., 2009).
The newly established homology also has practical implications.
Xiang et al. showed for the ﬁrst time that Rail has the RNA
5’ pyrophosphohydrolase activity and identiﬁed three acidic residues
as part of the Rail active site. However, since Xiang et al. have
not linked Rail/Dom3Z with the PD-(D/E)XK superfamily, the
conserved Lys (K241 in S.p0mbe Rail), part of the EXK motif
(Fig. 1), has been overlooked as the putative active site residue.

We next asked whether the inferred homology could be extended
to proteins of unknown structure. To this end, we used the COMA
server to search PFAM with the same Rail/Dom3Z MSA. We
readily identiﬁed three other PFAM families related (E-values
< 10—6) to Rail (Supplementary Fig. 3). These include PF10505
(NMDA receptor-regulated gene protein 2; NARG2), PF0509l
(Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit 7; eIF3d) and
PF08634 (Mitochondrial protein Petl27). While the PD—(D/E)XK
active site seems to be absent in NARG2 and not conserved in eIF3d,
Petl27 has all three conserved elements (Fig. l). Consistent with the
inferred active site, Petl27 has been found to possess the 5’ RNA
exonuclease activity (Fekete et (11., 2008). The involvement of both
Rail/Dom3Z and Petl27 in 5’ RNA processing raises a possibility
that binding to the 5’ -end of RNA might also be among potential
molecular ﬁinctions of NARG2 and eIF3d.

The above example illustrates how the COMA server may help
in inferring structure and ﬁinction of speciﬁc protein families.

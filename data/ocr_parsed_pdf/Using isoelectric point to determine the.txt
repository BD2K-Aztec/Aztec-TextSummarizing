Abstract

Motivation: The identification of suitable conditions for crystallization is a rate—limiting step in pro—
tein structure determination. The pH of an experiment is an important parameter and has the po—
tential to be used in data—mining studies to help reduce the number ofcrystallization trials required.
However, the pH is usually recorded asthat ofthe buffer solution, which can be highly inaccurate.
Results: Here, we show that a better estimate of the true pH can be predicted by considering not
only the buffer pH but also any other chemicals in the crystallization solution. We use these more
accurate pH values to investigate the disputed relationship between the pl of a protein and the pH
at which it crystallizes.

1 Introduction

As the predominant method used to determine molecular structure,
X-ray crystallography can provide information on the atomic level
processes of proteins and, in turn, enable the development of thera-
peutic drugs. In order to determine the structure of a target protein by
X-ray crystallography, the protein must be cloned and expressed be-
fore the soluble fraction is purified for crystallization. Only when dif-
fraction quality crystals are obtained can the structure be determined.
Although many protein structures have been solved to date, these only
account for some 3% of all possible protein targets (TargetDB, 2010),
with membrane protein structures being particularly challenging
(Caffrey, 2003) and underrepresented (Doerr, 2008). The use of a pri-
ori information about a protein to ascertain the optimal initial condi-
tions before experimentation could help reduce the number of trials
required which is valuable when protein sample availability is scarce.
Following the advent of online repositories, such as the Protein Data

Bank (PDB) (Berman et (11., 2000) and the Biological Macrmolecule
Crystallization Database (Tung and Gallagher, 2008) set up specific-
ally for the development of crystallization strategies (Gilliland et (11.,
1994), it has been possible to analyse the data from successful experi-
ments and determine favourable regions of crystallization parameter
space.

It has been shown that protein family can indicate a region of par-
ameter space in which a protein is likely to crystallize (Hennessy et (11.,
2000) and that properties such as amino acid frequency, sequence
length, grand average of hydrophobicity (GRAVY) (Kyte and
Doolittle, 1982) and isoelectric point (p1) as well as other properties
can determine a protein’s propensity to crystallize (Smialowski et (11.,
2006; Chen et (11., 2007; Overton et (11., 2008). Investigations have
also indicated that the isoelectric point could be used to determine the
pH at which a protein with an acidic isoelectric point is likely to crys-
tallize (Kantardjieff and Rupp, 2004; Charles et (11., 2006).

pH for initial protein crystallization trials

Crystallization is often described as a two—stage process, with the
first step being identification of the conditions that allow crystalliza—
tion, followed by the optimization of these conditions to obtain dif—
fraction—quality crystals (Luft et al., 2003; McPherson, 2004). This
study focuses on the first stage—the identification of conditions that
encourage crystallization. An analysis of 9596 structures obtained
from the PDB suggested a link between a protein’s p1 and the pH at
which it would crystallize. It was found that acidic proteins tended
to crystallize 0—2.5 pH units above their pI, whereas basic proteins
crystallized 0.5—3 pH units below their pI (Kantardjieff and Rupp,
2004). The authors reported a correlation between p1 and pH—pI
that was challenged with claims that the predictive statements had
been made using a misinterpretation of the data (Huber and Kobe,
2004). As a form of data normalization, there will always be a link
between p1 and pH—pI, but it was also highlighted that no correl—
ation between p1 and pH had been found previously (Page et al.,
2003; Wooh et al., 2003). In defence of their work, the authors of
the original study showed a correlation between the pI of acidic pro—
teins and the pH of successful crystallization and that a linear model
could be used to predict the optimal pH for such proteins. However,
they concluded that a similar model could not be created for basic
proteins because no significant correlation was found (Kantardjieff
et 41., 2004). Since the original study, similar relationships between
the pI of proteins and the buffer pH of successful crystallization ex—
periments have been noted for both acidic and basic proteins
(Charles et al., 2006).

The isoelectric point determines a protein’s minimum solubility
level due to protein—protein interactions being favoured over pro—
tein—water interactions (Gilliland, 1988; Luft et al., 2011). It should
therefore follow that a solution with a pH matching the isoelectric
point would be ideal for crystallization although this has never been
confirmed. One possible reason for this is that the recorded pH is
that of the buffer in the crystallization solution rather than the final
pH of the crystallization cocktail (Zhang et al. 2013). It is known
that the reported buffer pH can differ from the true pH of the ex—
periment by more than three pH units (Bukrinsky and Poulsen,
2001; Newman et al., 2012).

Measurement of pH using a pH meter is time consuming and can
be impractical if it requires reformatting of the crystallization screen
to accommodate the probe. We have shown previously that accurate
measurements of pH can be obtained for crystallization solutions
using spectrophotometry (Kirkwood et 41., 2014). The values deter—
mined by our spectrophotometric method are typically within 0.2 pH
units of those measured using a pH meter. Here, we use the spectro—
photometric pH values obtained from numerous experiments to train
a neural network to assign pH values to crystallization conditions.
These values are shown to provide accurate estimates of the pH that
can be used, for example, when mining databases such as the PDB.
Using data obtained from AstraZeneca and from the Structural
Genomics Consortium (SGC), Oxford, we show that most proteins,
both acidic and basic, do crystallize within one unit of their isoelectric
point. This in turn allows for custom crystallization screens to be de—
veloped in instances where protein availability is scarce and allows
deeper exploration of chemical parameter space as the pH is fixed.

also buffered at near neutral pH (either pH 6.5 or pH 7.5). In order
to determine the conditions for crystallization, each protein was ini—
tially screened using sitting—drop vapour diffusion with a bespoke 96
condition sparse matrix screen buffered at 6 different pHs using the
multi—component buffer PCTP (Newman, 2004; Zhang et 41.,
2013). This gave a total of 576 conditions with the buffer pH fixed
between pH 4.5 and pH 9.5. For each well, 80 #1 of crystallization
solution was dispensed using a Thermo Scientific Matrix Hydra II
robot. Frozen protein samples were defrosted to room temperature
before using a Mosquito pipetting robot (TTP Labtech) to dispense
1 #1 protein with 1 ‘ul of the mother liquor in MRC Wilden crystalli—
zation trays. Trays were sealed manually using transparent, pres—
sure—sensitive adhesive tape (Hampton) and stored in a Formulatrix
Rock Imager hotel at 20°C. All images were assessed for crystalliza—
tion after 21 days and the best crystallization conditions selected for
a particular protein. A finer sampling of pH was performed in a 96—
well plate with the chosen components buffered between pH 4.5
and pH 9.5 with PCTP.

2.2 The SGC dataset

The data obtained from the SGC in Oxford relate to 62 605 con—
structs, from which 608 solved protein structures have been de—
posited in the PDB. Descriptive metadata include protein sequence,
family and purification methods as well as crystallization conditions
and follow—up data with PDB codes where relevant. A subset of data
were extracted for experiments performed using the same SGC —
JCSG +4 sparse matrix screen. The extracted data comprised the
protein sequence and experimental conditions for 1057 different
protein sequences. Experimental results were assessed using the

between a protein’s p1 and the pH under which it will crystallize. In
addition to data for the conditions leading to protein structure solu—
tion, we have considered the pH of experiments producing crystals
that may not have been confirmed as diffraction quality. We found
that proteins frequently crystallize within one pH unit of their p1 and
that 85% of the proteins produced crystals within two pH units of
their pI. In most cases, proteins tended to crystallize at a more neutral
pH with acidic proteins crystallizing above their p1 and basic proteins
below their pI, confirming those results found previously
(Kantardjieff et al., 2004; Charles et al., 2006). As the majority of
proteins are of an acidic pI (Berman et al., 2000), we therefore suggest
that a useful initial pH for crystallization trials can be obtained from
the pI of the protein in question, but this pH should not simply be
taken as that of the buffer solution but, if not measured, should be ad—
justed to take into account the effect of any additional chemicals. As
some proteins do not crystallize close to their pI, we investigated pro—
tein properties to determine whether or not such proteins could be
predicted. In addition to pI, the GRAVY and the number of D, C, G,
H, M, F, P, S, T, W, Y residues (Overton et al., 2008) were calculated
for each sequence in the SGC dataset. These properties were used in
unsupervised analyses, including k—means clustering and multidimen—
sional scaling, but we were unable to determine any association be—
tween the sequence properties and the proteins propensity to
crystallize at a pH close to its pI. Differences in physical crystalliza—
tion conditions such as temperature and whether the protein sample
was frozen were not taken into account, although analysis showed
there were sequences that resulted in protein structures at 4 and room
temperature, for both fresh and frozen protein samples with and with—
out ligands.

It is interesting to note that two proteins in the AZ dataset,
Glycolytic enzyme A and Glycolytic enzyme D, have only the single
surface amino acid change E193A and E193D, respectively, but have
very different crystallization patterns. Although Glycolytic enzyme D
crystallizes within a limited pH range, Glycolytic enzyme A crystalli—
zes across a wide range of pH values. This supports the view of Dale
et al. (2003) that the protein itself is an important variable in crystalli—
zation and rational mutagenesis may aid the screening process.

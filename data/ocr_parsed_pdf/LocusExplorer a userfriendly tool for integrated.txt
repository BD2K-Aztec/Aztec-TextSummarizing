Abstract

Summary: In this article, we present LocusExplorer, a data visualization and exploration tool for gen—
etic association data. LocusExplorer is written in R using the Shiny library, providing access to power—
ful R—based functions through a simple user interface. LocusExplorer allows users to simultaneously
display genetic, statistical and biological data for humans in a single image and allows dynamic
zooming and customization of the plot features. Publication quality plots may then be produced in a

variety of file formats.

Availability and implementation: LocusExplorer is open source and runs through R and a web
browser. It is available at www.0ncogenetics.icr.ac.uk/LocusExplorer/ or can be installed locally
and the source code accessed from https://github.com/oncogenetics/LocusExplorer.

1 Introduction

Genome—wide association studies (GWAS) are a powerful tool to inter—
rogate genetic variation for association with a particular phenotype. A
large number of loci associated with a variety of diseases and traits
have been identified (Welter et (11., 2014); however, the statistically
most significant GWAS variants only tag loci within the genome that
contain the underlying functional variant(s), are rarely causal them—
selves and the association signals are frequently situated in non—coding
regions. Whilst deep resequencing of GWAS loci would ultimately be
desirable to precisely identify the causal functional variants behind
each signal, this approach is not routinely applied due to cost and time
constraints and instead imputation based fine—mapping strategies are
more commonly employed to narrow down the spectrum of associated
variation. These association data are subsequently annotated with bio—
logical information to prioritise an even smaller number of prospective
candidate causal variants for functional evaluation (Spain and Barrett,
2015

Whilst this process is substantially computational, manual inter—
pretation of the integrated statistical and biological data nonetheless
remains an important stage of the analysis process, which is facili—
tated by intuitive visualization. Although tools for the graphical
plotting of regional association data (Johnson et (11., 2008; Pruim
et (11., 2010) or annotation of biological context (Coetzee et (11.,
2012; Ward and Kellis, 2012) have previously been developed, these
are generally unable to integrate both information types together for
simultaneous scrutiny. The recent ENLIGHT web tool provided the
first simultaneous annotation of diverse data types within the same
plot (Guo et (11., 2015); however, as with all currently available pro—
grams, there remains an inherent limitation with respect to the abil—
ity to modify plots without starting over. We therefore developed a
novel human GWAS data visualization application, LocusExplorer,
to facilitate navigation and interpretation of our findings during a
recent fine—mapping study of previously identified prostate cancer
(PrCa) susceptibility loci (Amin Al Olama et (11., 2015). We have

subsequently refined and upgraded the application, to facilitate plot—
ting of custom user data.

2 LocusExplorer software

LocusExplorer is an open—source application written in the R pro—
gramming language (R Core Team, 2015) using the Shiny frame—
work (Chang et al., 2015) and uses existing R packages, in
particular from Bioconductor (Huber et al., 2015) and ggplot2
(Wickham, 2009) to facilitate annotation and visualization of mul—
tiple levels of data. R is available for Linux, MacOS and Windows
operating systems, enabling LocusExplorer to run across multiple
platforms. LocusExplorer is publically available at www.oncoge
netics.icr.ac.uk/LocusExplorer/ or can be installed locally through
https://github.com/oncogenetics/LocusExplorer. The local applica—
tion requires only the installation of R 3.2.2 or above with the
packages specified in the installation instructions and a web browser
in order to run. This simple framework also provides an intuitive
interface for the application, to facilitate operation by all level of
users.

LocusExplorer is designed to visualize multiple and diverse
forms of genomic information, as individual tracks are
aligned to a common genomic coordinate axis. Plot features and
parameters can be adjusted dynamically throughout the plotting
process. Publication quality finalized plots can be downloaded
in PDF, SVG, JPEG and TIFF file formats. The Manhattan plot
portion of the image displays SNP position, P—value and linkage
disequilibrium (LD) structures for variants, plus recombination
rates within the region. This feature has been optimized to facili—
tate the simultaneous display and comparison of co—situated but
uncorrelated clusters of associated variants; making the applica—
tion ideally suited for displaying fine—mapping data or regions
containing multiple independent hits (Amin Al Olama et al.,
2015).

In our initial public release, LocusExplorer v0.4, the user can
provide three custom inputs; a SNP association file, LD information
file and a bedGraph format file. The only required file is the SNP as—
sociation file; the additional LD information file is optional but
highly recommend as this allows the graphical representation of LD
patterns greatly enhancing plot informativeness. We have included
detailed help instructions within the application and processing
tools to aid the acquisition of LD data from publically available re—
sources if required.

Figure 1 demonstrates the optional tracks that can be displayed
on the plot, which include the density of typed and imputed
markers, annotation of variants correlated to the index SNP(s), the
locations of H3K27Ac and DNase I Hypersensitivity assay features
from the ENCODE Project, gene positions (RefSeq) and a track dis—
playing custom data from the user supplied bedGraph file (Benson
et al., 2004; Encode Project Consortium, 2012; Rosenbloom et al.,
2015

The design of LocusExplorer emphasizes simplicity of use and
the simultaneous display of diverse annotations as its primary aims.
We anticipate that researchers would primarily use the application
to explore the biological context of variants associated with a
phenotype, to help inform the design of subsequent experiments. In
addition, we have made data from our PrCa fine—mapping study
(Amin Al Olama et al., 2015) available within the application for
interested parties to explore further. Development of LocusExplorer
is ongoing and we will endeavour to add new tracks and improve
existing features where applicable. We would welcome any user
comments and contributions to the project.

Fig. 1. Example LocusExplorer plot for the HNF1B PrCa risk locus at
Chr17q12. Two independent PrCa association signals (rs11649743 and
r54430796) had previously been reported at this region. Fine-mapping identi-
fied more strongly associated variants to describe both of these known sig-
nals (rs718961 and rs11263763, respectively), in addition to a previously
unknown third independent association (r52229295). Variants in LD with the
index SNPs are colour coded and provide an indication of the boundaries of
each signal. The plot also shows the density of genotyped and imputed SNPs
analyzed, the distribution of Histone marks within 7 cell lines and DNase I
hypersensitivity sites in 125 cell types from the ENCODE Project, positions of
regulatory elements within the LNCaP cell line and genes within the region
colour coded by DNA strand. The custom user track option has also been
used to display an eOTL associated with downregulation of the HNF1B gene

Abstract

Motivation: A basic problem of broad public and scientific interest is to use the DNA of an individ—
ual to infer the genomic ancestries of the parents. In particular, we are often interested in the
fraction of each parent’s genome that comes from specific ancestries (e.g. European, African,
Native American, etc). This has many applications ranging from understanding the inheritance of
ancestry—related risks and traits to quantifying human assortative mating patterns.

Results: We model the problem of parental genomic ancestry inference as a pooled semi—Markov
process. We develop a general mathematical framework for pooled semi—Markov processes and
construct efficient inference algorithms for these models. Applying our inference algorithm to
genotype data from 231 Mexican trios and 258 Puerto Rican trios where we have the true genomic
ancestry of each parent, we demonstrate that our method accurately infers parameters of the
semi—Markov processes and parents’ genomic ancestries. We additionally validated the method on
simulations. Our model of pooled semi—Markov process and inference algorithms may be of

 

independent interest in other settings in genomics and machine learning.

1 Introduction

Recent developments in DNA technology bring personal genomics
to reality. This opens up unprecedented possibilities for individuals
to learn about their genomic history (e.g. ancestry, family history)
as well as their genomic future (e.g. disease risk). A particular aspect
of personal genomics that has garnered significant public and
medical interest is the ability to precisely quantify the ancestry com—
position of one’s genome (Royal and Kittles, 2004; Royal at £11.,
2010).

Consider a Mexican individual as an example. Her genome con—
sists of alternating blocks of DNA sequences, where each block has
African, European or Native American ancestry. The length and fre—
quency distributions of blocks from different ancestries reﬂect the
patterns of admixtures over the last several centuries. A substantial
fraction of humans today are offsprings of historical mixing between
distinct populations and their genomes are such mosaics of ancestry
blocks (Hellenthal at £11., 2014).

The ability to quantify genomic ancestries has important bio—
medical implications. For example, African ancestry is a risk factor
for asthma. This partially explains the high prevalence of asthma in

African American as well as Puerto Ricans with larger African gen—
omic ancestry (Vergara at £11., 2013). In addition, genomic ancestry
gives insights into many social science questions, and expands the
common notions of ethnicity and race (Bryc at £11., 2015; Hochschild
and Sen, 2015).

Given the genome of an individual, recent machine learning
methods can accurately determine the fraction of this person’s gen—
ome that originates from each ancestry (Alexander at £11., 2009;
Pritchard at £11., 2000). However, for many applications in biomed—
ical and social science research, it is important to go beyond the indi—
vidual’s ancestry and to infer the genomic ancestries of the parents
(since most genetic datasets do not have genotype information from
the parents). In studies of ancestry linked risk factors, genomic an—
cestry information of parents can be used to investigate how risks
propagate through generations. In social science applications, paren—
tal genomic ancestry can be used to understand genetic basis of
human mate selection, a subject of substantial recent interest. Latino
parents, e.g. were shown to have significant correlations in their
genomic ancestries (Risch at £11., 2009).

Inferring parental genomic ancestries

i191

 

However, current methods cannot be used to infer the genomic
ancestry of each of the two parents of an individual given only the
DNA of the individual. Inferring parental genomic ancestry is chal—
lenging since the observed DNA are unordered pools of the DNA
from the two parents. We show that this problem of parental
genomic ancestry inference can be well modeled as a pooled semi—
Markov process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
method that can accurately infer the parameters of the parental
ancestries in admixed populations.

We applied the efficient algorithms we have developed for
pooled semi—Markov process to infer parental ancestry. On experi—
mental data from 231 Mexican families and 258 Puerto Rican fami—
lies for whom we know the true genomic ancestry of each parent,
we show that our method provides accurate estimates of parental
genomic ancestry. Our method applies to any common genotyping
data from an individual; importantly, no family or phasing informa—
tion is needed, and hence it is broadly applicable to existing genetic
data. Although in this article, we focus on the application of infer—
ring genomic ancestry, we believe that many other settings can also
be modeled as pooled semi—Markov process. For example in a tumor
sample, there are many clonal subpopulations of cells, each with its
own copy number aberrations which can be modeled as a semi—
Markov process (Wu at £11., 2014). When we sequence the tumor in
clinics, we typically obtain a pooled collection of reads from the
various subpopulations.

1.1 Contributions
Our main contributions are:

1. We set up the mathematical framework of pooled semi—Markov
processes and construct efﬁcient, scalable inference algorithms.

2. Using this framework of pooled semi—Markov processes, we de—
velop a method to infer the parameters of the parental ancestries
in admixed populations. This is important because it allows for
a better understanding of how certain disease risks are associ—
ated with ancestries.

3. We demonstrate the accuracy of our method on a real genotype
dataset of 489 families where we can measure the true genomic
ancestry of each parent. We further validate it using simulations.

1.2 Related work

Semi—Markov models have been well studied in literature and have
many applications ranging from economics to biology (Ross, 1999).
A related class of models for sequential data is factorial HMMs
(FHMMs) (Ghahramani and Jordan, 1997). FHMMs model outputs
that are function of several hidden states where each hidden state
evolves according to an independent Markov model. Because exact
inference in FHMMs is intractable, a number of approximate infer—
ence procedures have been developed. The pooled semi—Markov
process differs from FHMM in significant ways. First, the holding
time in each HMM state is geometrically distributed, while we allow
for arbitrary distributions. Second, the pooling model introduces
hard combinatorial constraints that make standard variational infer—
ence inapplicable.

There is a large body of work on the inference of local ancestry
in admixed populations, in which the ancestry of each position in
the genome is inferred. These methods typically use hidden Markov
chain models, (e.g. Price at £11., 2009; Pritchard at £11., 2000;
Sankararaman at £11., 2008a; Tang at £11., 2006) variants such as
switch HMMs (Sankararaman at £11., 2008b) and factorial HMMs
(Baran at £11., 2012). Principal component analysis (PCA) has been
shown to correlate well with global ancestry, and variants of PCA

have been proposed (Yang at £11., 2012). In the case of African—
Americans, these models have been applied to show that African—
Americans today are an admixture of African and European
ancestries in the ratio 0.8:0.2 over the last 6—10 generations (Smith
at £11., 2004). Further, it has been shown that local ancestry can be
accurately inferred in African—Americans. A limitation of these
approaches is that they do not distinguish between the maternal and
the paternal contributions to the genetic ancestry. Methods, such as
Hapmix (Price at £11., 2009), estimate the unordered pair of local an—
cestry states at each position but do not assign the local ancestry to
each parental haplotype and hence do not tell us the genomic ances—
tries of each parent.

2 Methods

2.1 Pooled semi—Markov processes

A semi—Markov process generalizes continuous time Markov process
to settings where the holding time in a state may not be exponen—
tially distributed. We recall the generative procedure for sampling
from a semi—Markov process of K states.

Definition: Let f denote the probability density function of a
random variable parametrized by 7» (7» could represent either a scalar
or a vector depending on the form of the density function). To
sample from a K—state semi—Markov process parametrized by
{7%, 0:61;“ 2 or;a : 1, we do the following:

i <— 1.

Sample the state of the ﬁrst block, ((91 ~ Discrete({ork}).
Sample the length of the ﬁrst block, L1 ~ [(0%] 

Repeat while 1 L,- < L, where L is a speciﬁed length:

:F‘SNPE‘

' i <— i + 1
' Sample the state of block i, d),- N Discrete({&k}¢iil), where
6r), : “l ifk 5A d>,-_1 and 61%, : 0.

1_“¢r71
' Sample the length of block i, L,- N f (Mi).

 

We call f (M) the holding distribution of state [2 and a jump is a tran—
sition between two consecutive blocks. For our applications it is suf—
ficient to work with this parametrization of the transitions using
0112’s. All results can be extended to general semi—Markov process.
The output sample is a chain of length L composed of blocks of
distinct states. For the last block, we cut it off so that it stops at L.
For x E [0,L], we denote by d>(x) the state of the block that x
belongs to, i.e. d>(x) : d),- ifx is in block i.

If f is the exponential distribution, then the corresponding
semi—Markov process is equivalent to a continuous time Markov
chain. For state [2, the holding time is the time spent in that
state and is an exponentially distributed random variable with
rate lk. If we observe the states d>(x) for an individual semi—
Markov process and L is sufficiently long, then it is straightfor—
ward to perform maximum likelihood inference of the parameters
{Name}. In genetics and other applications however, we do not
observe each individual process but a pool of multiple semi—
Markov processes where the identity of which process a given
state is from is lost.

Definition: Suppose we have M independent semi—Markov
processes, each of length L. The j—th process is parametrized by
{My k:1 and the state of the j—th process in position x is denoted
by cl)’  The pooled semi-Markov process (abbreviated as PSMP) is
obtained by the assignment of each x E [0,L] to the K—dimensional
vector of counts, <I>(x), such that the k—th entry is number of

elements in  that equals to k. We call <I>(x), x E [0,L], the
observations of the pooled semi—Markov process. The model is para—
metrized by (9 E {7]  .

We focus on continuous holding distributions f such that with
probability 1 each process has a finite number of jumps in [0, L]. Let
N denote the sum of the number of jumps across all M processes.
Then the continuous observations of the pooled semi—Markov pro—
cess can be concisely described by the finite set X : {(I>,-,L,-}§:1,
where (I),- is the counts vector observed at the i—th block across the
M processes, and L,- is the length of this block. Note that for con—
tinuous distributions, the probability that two blocks of two differ—
ent semi—Markov chains end at the same point x is zero, thus with
probability one (I); and (13,11 differ by one transition. When it is clear
from context, we also use the equivalent representation
<I><x> : {web-All.

Under a pooled semi—Markov process, the likelihood of the par—
ameters (9 is

P(X1(9):J1[Z:1e(cl>j(x)) : <I>(x),Vx 6 10,0]
11:.dP<¢il{xl,%}k:1,,.,,K>

where e(cbi is the unit vector with 1 in the (19"(x)th entry and
le’(cbi) is the measure induced by the jth semi—Markov process.
In the above integral, the set of hard constraints
1 e(d>i(x)) : <I>(x),Vx E [0,L] are finite (there being a single
constraint for each of the N blocks). Nevertheless, these constraints
make it intractable to exactly compute the likelihood in general. We

develop efficient approximations below.

Example: An application of the pooled semi—Markov process nat—
urally arises in the field of population genetics. The diploid genome
of an individual consists of one transmitted genome from each par—
ent (the two segments in Fig. 1). The transmitted genome of each
parent is a sequence of intervals, where each interval has a different
genomic ancestry—(E)uropean, (A)frican, (N)ative American, etc.
For example, if the mother is African American, then the genome
that she passes on to the offspring is a mosaic of blocks of state A of
some length distribution and state E of a possibly a different length
distribution, and similarly for the father. Hence the genome passed
from the mother to the offspring is well—modeled by a semi—Markov
process (Donnelly, 1983; Gravel, 2012). When we genotype the off—
spring, say the one in Figure 1, we can infer that first region has an—
cestry AA and the second region has ancestry EA (using method
described in the next section); however, we do not know whether
the E part come from parent 1 or parent 2, and thus the information
about the parents’ ancestry is lost. Given the pooled observations of
the ancestries (e.g. AA, AE, EE) at every point in the genome, the
goal is to infer the parameters {My 01L} 13:1 for both parents. The Ns
parametrizes the length distribution of each ancestry state in a par—
ent and the 01’s capture the frequency of the ancestry states. With
estimates for these parameters, we can infer the global ancestry of
each parent, i.e. the fraction of the individual’s genome that is

generations since the admixture.

2.2 Algorithms for inference

We first consider the parameter estimation problem for pooled semi—
Markov processes with exponential holding distributions (which are
equivalent to continuous time Markov processes). Exponential hold—
ing distribution captures many of the genetic datasets of interests
and can often be used as a reasonable approximation to other more
complex distributions. We treat this problem in a Bayesian setting in
which we place a prior on the parameter vector (9 E {71.1, 
and for a given observation X E {(I>,-, L,}§:1, we compute the poster—
ior probability Pr ((91X). We approximate the posterior using a
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). To compute the likelihood as
part of the MCMC, we developed a dynamic programming algo—
rithm. In the next section, we show that this method gives accurate
posterior estimates of the parameters of the model on genotype data
from Mexican and Puerto Rican families.

For the non—exponential case, the dynamic programming algo—
rithm needs to keep track of all the possible lengths for which a
block of ancestry extends. This becomes expensive when the number
of blocks, N, is large. Hence, we develop a more general stochastic—
Expectation—Maximization (EM) algorithm to perform maximum
likelihood inference on general pooled semi—Markov chains, as
described in the next subsection. Note that there is an inherent sym—
metry in terms of which process we label as 1, 2, etc. that is not iden—
tifiable. Here we assume that the processes are labeled according to
some arbitrary but fixed order, and the goal is to recover the param—
eters up to permutation of labels.

2.3 MCMC inference algorithm for pooled

Markov process

For given I observations X E {(I>,-, L,}§:1 and parameters
(9 E {71.2,  we use dynamic programming to compute the
exact likelihood of the parameters, P(X1(9). For each i: 1, ...,N,
we keep track of all the distinct ordered states that are permutations
of the observation (I),- :  For example, if (I),- : {A,E}, then
the consistent ordered states are (A, E), where state A is generated
by process 1, and (E, A), where state A is generated by process 2.
Note that we denote ordered states by  and unordered states by 
For a given unordered set (13,-, we denote by {n(<I>,-)1n 6 5,} all the dis—
tinct ordered tuples that are consistent with (13,-. Here S,- is the permu—
tations of [1, ...,M] that give rise to distinct tuples. For each 11(0),),
let P,(1I(<I>,-)1(9) be the probability of observing {(131, ...,(I>,-_1,1I((I>,-)}
in a pooled Markov chain parametrized by (9. In other words, this is
the probability of seeing the unordered observation up to i— 1 and
then observing the ordered tuple 11(0),). There are in the worst case
KM such P,-(1I(<I>,-)1(9) for each i.

1. For i:1, if the ordered state is n(<I>1) : (491,...,¢11VI), then
, M i i _ i
P1(1I((I>1)1(9)—1_L:1 a¢g7v¢gexp( 71.4);L1).
2. Given all the probabilities P,-_1(1I(<I>,-_1)1(9), we have
P41109019» = Z Pi—1(ﬁ(¢i—1)l®)P(ﬁ(¢i—1) —* “((13019)

where S,_1(1I) are all the tuples that are one edit distance from it
(since we know exactly one jump in one process has occurred be—
tween block i — 1 and i almost surely) and consistent with <I>,-_1,
and p(ﬁ((I>,-_1) —> n((I>,-)1(9) is the probability for transitioning
from ﬁ((I>,-_1) to 11(0),), which can be computed analytically as a
product of exponentials and 0171’s.

For example, suppose the states are E and A, and the observation at
i is {E, E}. In this case there is just one tuple, (E, E), consistent with
it, and

In the first term of the right hand side, e‘i‘iLi is the contribution
from continuing E with E in the first chain, and lie—AEL‘ comes
from continuing A with E in the second chain. And similarly for the
second term of the right—hand side. Because there are two states in
each chain, 01’s do not appear.

Given this method for computing the likelihood of any observed

data X for parameters (9 : {ll/jg, 01/1,}:1, we use adaptive MCMC to
compute the posterior distribution over (9. The advantage of this
approach is that we obtain full posterior distributions of (9, and for
several human populations, it gives accurate estimations (next
section). A drawback is that computing the exact likelihood is
expensive when the state space is large or when there are many
chains—the run time is O(KM

2.4 Stochastic EM inference algorithm for general
pooled semi—Markov process

For general semi—Markov processes with non—exponential holding
times, the dynamic programing would have to keep track of the last
ordered state as well as its length, making it prohibitively expensive
to compute the likelihood. We therefore propose a stochastic EM
algorithm to perform parameter inference in general pooled
semi—Markov processes. For each block i, the observation is the
unordered set of states  Let Z be an M—by—N matrix where
Z[j, i] E [1, ...,M] denote the process that generated the state (b;- at
block i. Z is the matrix of the latent variables.

2.4.1 E-step

Given the current values of the parameters (9 and observations X, it
is in general intractable to compute the posterior p(Z]X, (9).
However we can generate samples {2,} from p(Z]X,(9) using an
efficient sequential procedure using the expansion

P(Z]X, o) 2 P(Z[:, 111x, (9)P(Z[:, 21121;, 1],X, o)
...P(Z[:,N]]Z[:,N — 1],X, o).

For the base case, let (1)1 : {c191, ..., 491114}, then

12(212. 1llXﬂ) 2 p<ziz.1il<1>1.®> o< 11:, mil“
subject to the contraint that Z[:, 1] is a permutation of [1, ...,M]. This
can be sampled efficiently using rejection sampling. The vector Z[:, i]
is one edit distance from Z[:, i — 1], so that given Z[:,i — 1] there are
at most KM—feasible values for Z[:, i]. If vector W differs from
Z[:, i — 1] in index i, then p(W]Z[:,i — 1],X, (9) can be computed as a
function of the length of the current state for the j—th semi—Markov
process and the a’ja’s. Therefore we can explicitly compute the condi—
tional probability of Z[:, i] given Z[:,i — 1] for all values of Z[:, i]. To
sample Z[:, i] we just sample from these conditional probabilities.

2.4.2 M—step

Given samples Zs of the latent variables, we compute the max—
imum likelihood (9 by maximizing Hp(X, Zs](9). Given Z, the par—
ameters 7L], and or]a are independents for different /' E [1, ...,M]. For
that r—th semi—Markov process, the optimization problem is

arg max H p({c]>[s.t.ZS [j, i]:r}, {Li} ] W, 01’). For standard distribu—
tions, this‘optimization can be solved analytically.
We iterate the E and M steps until convergence.

3 Results

3.1 Mexican and Puerto Rican trios

We used 231 Mexican mother—father—child trios and 25 8 Puerto
Rican trios from the Genetics of Asthma in Latino Americans
(GALA) study (Risch et £11., 2009) For each trio, we have the geno—
types of the two parents and the offspring across the entire genome.
The trios were genotyped using the Affymetrix 6.0 GeneChip Array,
which provides measurements of the genome at over 900 000 pos—
itions, called single nucleotide polymorphisms. Subjects were filtered
based on call rates >95 %, consistency between reported and genetic
sex, and the absence of any unexpected identity by descent (IBD) or
by state. Familial relationships were confirmed using measures of
IBD and Mendelian inconsistencies.

We used LAMP—LD, a commonly used method, to infer the local
ancestry state at each position in the genome in each individual
(Baran et [1]., 2012). LAMP—LD uses a generative model in which the
genome is divided into non—overlapping windows. An admixed gen—
ome is generated as an emission within each window from a HMM

with  states, where K is the number of ancestral populations.

Transitions between the hidden states occur between adjacent win—
dows. LAMP—LD computes a Viterbi decoding of the pairs of local
ancestries along the genome. Since Puerto—Ricans and Mexicans
have mixed ancestry with (E)uropean, (A)frican, and (N)ative
American ancestries, LAMP—LD assigns to each position in the gen—
ome one of 6 states: EE, NN, AA, EA, EN and NA, depending on
the ancestry of that position (e.g. NA corresponds to the case where
one copy originated in Africa and the other in America).

In these datasets, we observed that the genomes of each of the
parents are well approximated by exponential length distribution
and hence by a Markov process. The genome of the child can then
be modeled as a pooled Markov process, with M22 and K23.
Note that in general, the genomes of the parents themselves cannot
be modeled as a Markov process but as a semi—Markov process
(Gravel, 2012). However in these data the exponential distribution
proved to be a good approximation, likely because admixture
occurred many generations ago in these samples and have been con—
tinuing ever since.

For the validation experiment, we take as input the observed
local ancestry blocks of each offspring, and use the MCMC algo—
rithm described earlier, with uniform priors, to infer the posterior
distribution over the parameters of the model. In these data, the
MCMC estimates are more accurate than estimates from the sto—
chastic EM (not shown). There are six 7» parameters and four inde—
pendent 01 parameters. The global European (or African, Native
American) genomic ancestry of an individual is defined to be the
proportion of the total genome that is identified to be of European
(or African, Native American) descent. For each set of parameters,
we infer the global ancestry proportion of the corresponding parent
by running a Markov chain with these parameters to equilibrium
and computing the fractions. Then we compare the inferred global
genomic ancestry of each parent with the true genomic ancestry of
the parent computed explicitly by running LAMP—LD.

Genomes of Mexican samples contain primarily European
(average of 43%) and Native American (49%) ancestries, and a
small amount of African ancestry. In contrast, Puerto Ricans gen—
omes contain mostly European (62%) and African (23%) ancestries,

with a minor component of Native American. Moreover the two
populations have distinct demographic histories leading to different
statistical properties of their ancestries, corresponding to different
distributions of N5 and 01’s (Bryc et £11., 2010). Hence these two data—
sets are complementary in exploring the performance of our ap—
proach under different conditions.

Table 1 contains the r2 between our estimated genomic ances—
tries using PSMP and the true genomic ancestries in the 462
Mexican (MX) parents and 516 Puerto Rican (PR) parents. We
report the r2 for each of the ancestry states: European (E), Native
American (N), African (A). In Mexican trios, our estimated propor—
tions of European and Native American ancestries agree very well
with the ground truth (coefficient of determination r220.84 for
both). It performs worse in estimating the African proportion, likely
because African blocks are only observed a few times in most sam—
ples. In Puerto Rican trios, our estimates for the European and
African ancestries closely match the ground truth. It performs worse
for the less frequent Native American ancestry (Figs. 2 and 3).

In addition to accurately estimating the global genomic ances—
tries of each parent, our method also infers finer grained informa—
tion. In particular, since the holding distributions are exponential,
1 /7» gives the average block length of each ancestry type in a parent.
From standard coalescent models of population genetics, these

length scales inform us the number of generations since the inter—
breeding of these populations in the family history of that individ—
ual. We compare the inferred length scales for each parent and
ancestry type with the ground truth measured on the transmitted
allele. In Mexicans, there’s strong correlation between length esti—
mates from our method and the ground truth for European and
Native American ancestries (r2 of 0.73 and 0.75, respectively). The
estimate is less accurate for the less frequent African block lengths
(r2 : 0.25). For Puerto Ricans, we find the strongest agreement in
the block lengths of Africans (r220.75), followed by Europeans
(r2 : 0.54) and Native Americans (r2 : 0.45).

3.1.1 Scalability

Our algorithms treat the samples independently and can be run
in parallel on all the samples. For each human sample, it required
35 min on a standard desktop.

3.2 Comparison to benchmarks

In practice, it is often assumed that the genomic ancestry of the
offspring is a good approximation of the ancestry of the parents.
This only works if the genomic ancestries of the two parents are very
similar, since the offspring’s ancestry essentially averages the par—
ents’. This assumption is especially problematic in admixed popula—
tions (Latinos, African Americans, etc.) where the two parents may
have very different ancestries. We tested this assumption in our trios,
where we use the empirically measured genomic ancestry of the off—
spring as estimations of the parents’ ancestries. The correlation with
the true genomic ancestries is reported in the second row of Table 1,
and it is significantly worse than the results of the pooled semi—
Markov process. For more heterogeneous populations, we expect the
offspring to be even worse estimators of the parent’s ancestry.

The pooled semi—Markov process explicitly models the spatial
correlation of nearby states. A simpler algorithm is to assume that
all the observations are independent. The accuracy of this simpler
model is reported in the third row of Table 1. It performs worse

3.3 Simulations

3.3.1 Random trios

As an additional validation, we tested our algorithm on simulated
Mexican male—female—offspring trios. In the actual trios, using the
genotype of the three individuals, we inferred the transmitted allele
from each parent to the offspring. To generate a random trio, we then
randomly selected a male and a female parent and computationally
combined their transmitted alleles to form a new offspring. This
creates realistic offspring genotypes while preserving the complex
demography encoded in the parents’ transmitted alleles. Using this
process, we simulated 100 new trios for which we knew the true gen—
omic ancestry of each individual. As before, we applied our method to
the offspring data to infer the ancestries of the parents. Comparison of
the inferred ancestries with the ground truth showed very good agree—
ment (Fig. 4). For the European, Native American and African ances—
tries, we achieved r2 of 0.9, 0.89 and 0.77, respectively.

3.3.2 Non-exponential chains

We also investigated how well we can do inference on pooled semi—
Markov processes where the distributions are very different from ex—
ponential, as these could be relevant for other demographic models
and applications. We consider the particular case where the block
lengths of each state are Gaussian distributed. We use the more gen—
eral stochastic EM algorithm given above to perform inference.

In the experiments, we varied K : 2, ..., 6 and M : 2, ...,5. For
each combination of K and M, we simulate 50 pools of semi—
Markov processes. We consider unit variant Gaussians with mean
M. For each process, we sampled or uniformly from the K—dim sim—
plex and sample 2k uniformly from [5, 10]. Different processes in
the same pool have different or’s and 2’s. Each observed dataset is
created by pooling M different Gaussian semi—Markov processes. To
better match the quantity and noise of realistic genomic data, we use
only the first N :500 blocks of the pooled semi—Markov process
as observations. This is the input into our stochastic EM algorithm.
To evaluate the estimation, we compute the r2 between the esti—
mated Ns and the true 2’s and between the estimated and true or’s,
across all pools and all processes. The results are summarized in

and different line colors correspond to different number of processes M. For the or estimations, K: 2 is trivial since all the or's are 0.5, and is omitted

Figure 4. For M : 2, 3, we obtain accurate estimations for even large
numbers of states, with r2 > 0.8. The accuracy of inference declines
as the number of processes in a pool increases. In these more com—
plex models, we can improve our accuracy by collecting larger num—
ber of observations (N) from each pool (Fig. 5).

4 Discussion

We developed an efficient method to infer the genomic ancestry of
the parents from the genotype of an offspring. We applied our
method to genotype data of 231 Mexican and 258 Puerto Rican in—
dividuals to infer the parents’ ancestries. We showed that the
method is highly accurate by comparing the inferred ancestries with
each parent’s true genomic ancestries. We further validated the
method on simulated trios. For pooled Markov processes, we
showed how to compute likelihood exactly using dynamic program—
ming. For general pooled semi—Markov processes, we developed a
stochastic EM algorithm to infer the model parameters. We add—
itionally validated accuracy of our inference algorithm in settings
where the semi—Markov length distributions are Gaussians.

We tested our algorithm on Latino trios, but it can be applied to
other admixed populations and can be used to infer ancestries other
than European, Native American and African. The method can be
used on general genotype datasets of unrelated, unphased individ—
uals, for which large cohorts exist, to infer the genomic ancestries of
the parents. This has immediate applications in investigating as—
sortative mating in human populations.

The current approach assumes that the local ancestry of the off—
spring has been computed from his/her genotype. This is reasonable
for large admixed populations such as Latinos and African
Americans, where existing algorithms (e.g. LAMP—LD) can accurate
infer the local ancestries. For other admixed populations, an inter—
esting direction of future work is to jointly infer the local ancestry of
the offspring and the global ancestries of the parents

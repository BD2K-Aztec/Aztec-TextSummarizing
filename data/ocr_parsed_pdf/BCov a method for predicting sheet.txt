In this article, we describe BCov, a new approach for B—sheet
topology prediction based on sparse inverse covariance estima—
tion and integer programming. BCov is the ﬁrst unsupervised
method that addresses this task. We use the residue—contact pro—
pensities provided by the Protein Sparse Inverse COVariance
(PSICOV) method (Jones et al., 2012) to compute the scores of
the B—strand pairings. We selected PSICOV because it is freely
available and does not require proprietary software to run. Then
we apply an integer programming optimization to assign the [3—
sheet topology. BCov well compares with the performances of
the state—of—the—art algorithms (BetaPro, CMMs and MLNs)
that integrate supervised techniques to address the same task.

2 METHODS

2.1 The BetaSheet916 dataset

The BetaSheet916 dataset was ﬁrst introduced by Cheng and Baldi (2005)
to evaluate their BetaPro method for B-sheet prediction and then adopted
by other authors (Burkoff et al., 2013; Lippi and Frasconi, 2009). The set
is routinely adopted as benchmark set for B-sheet prediction methods and
for sake of comparison we also use it in this article. The atomic coord-
inates of 916 protein chains (with X-ray diffraction at a resolution 52.5
A) were extracted from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) as to May, 2004
(Cheng and Baldi, 2005). Secondary structure assignments were com-
puted by means of the Deﬁne Secondary Structure of Proteins (DSSP)
program (Kabsch and Sander, 1983). Both extended B-strands (marked
by E in the DSSP output) and isolated B-bridges (B in the DSSP output)
were considered B-residues. The B-contact maps were deﬁned using in-
formation about B-partnership available from the DSSP output. Statistics
of the dataset are shown in Table l.

2.2 The BetaSheetl452 dataset

To complement the BetaSheet916 dataset, we constructed a new dataset
of more recently deposited high-resolution proteins. We extracted from
the PDB a set of protein chains whose structures were obtained by X-ray
diffraction with a resolution 5 2.5 A. We restricted our search to PDB
entries deposited after May, 2004 to exclude chains already present in the
BetaSheet916 dataset. We ﬁltered out protein sequences at 20% of se-
quence identity level to obtain a non-redundant dataset. More import-
antly, we also removed sequences with identity >20% with any of the
proteins contained in the BetaSheet916 set. We used DSSP to assign
secondary structures, and we ﬁltered out sequences having <3 distinct
extended B-strands to exclude trivial cases. We also discharged protein
chains shorter than 50 residues or having backbone interruptions or non-
standard amino acids. The ﬁnal dataset of proteins, referred to as
BetaSheetl452, contained 1452 protein chains. Statistics are shown in
Table l.

2.3 CASP 2010 dataset

For sake of comparison, we also considered protein chains from the
Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP) 2010 experi-
ment. The original set comprised 116 targets. We used the same proced-
ure described in Burkoff et a]. (2013) to ﬁlter out sequences with a
number of B-residues 5 10. The ﬁnal set consisted of 92 protein chains.
Secondary structures have been assigned using DSSP.

2.4 MSA construction

For each sequence in the datasets described earlier in the text, we ob-
tained an MSA using the jackhmmer program that is part of HMMER
3.0 package (http://hmmer.org). Given a target protein sequence,

homologous sequences were found by running three iterations of jackhm-
mer against the UNIREF90 database (Magrane and the Uniprot
Consortium, 2011) setting the E—value threshold to le-3. The correspond-
ing MSA has been obtained from jackhmmer output.

2.5 BCov general description

BCov consists of three main steps: (i) compute the residue contact pro-
pensity with PSICOV; (ii) compute the score of each possible B-strand
pairing; (iii) compute the B-sheet topology using an integer programming
optimization to ﬁnd the best solution according to the B-pairing
scores and constraints. Below we report the details of these three major
steps.

2.6 Computing the residue contact propensity with
PSICOV

For sake of clarity, in this section we provide a brief description of the
PSICOV method. We refer to Jones et a]. (2012) for further details about
the method.

Starting from an MSA with m columns, PSICOV ﬁrst computes a
sample 2lm-by-2lm (also gaps are considered) covariance matrix C
using observed single and pair amino acid occurrence frequencies:

6:3” =ﬁ.,-(a, b) —ﬁ(a)J"j(b) (1)

where fit/(ab), f,-(a) and f,~(b) are the sample relative frequency of
amino acid pair ab at sites  the relative frequency of amino
acid a at column 1' and the frequency of amino acid b at column j,
respectively.

The inverse of the sample covariance matrix is computed with the
graphical lasso method (Banerjee et al., 2008; Friedman et al., 2008).
This algorithm allows estimating a sparse inverse covariance matrix 6)
by minimizing the following objective function:

J .1
Z Cij®ij — logdet® + p 2 18271 (2)
i.j=1 UT]

where C is a d—by-d covariance matrix, 6) is the inverse covariance matrix
and the last term is a regularization term (the El-norm of the inverse
matrix) that governs the sparsity of the solutions. p is the sparsity
hyper-parameter: the greater is p the sparser is the solution.

The sparse inverse covariance matrix 6) is used, in turn, to derive a
contact score between residues at positions 1' and j by computing the

the indices see Section 3.2.

(a simple geometric constraint) the accuracy increases, as high—
lighted by the two percentage points of the correlation coefficient
(MCC). BCov and BCov6 performances compare well with
the single supervised methods (CMM, BetaPro, MLN) and
are slightly worse than the combination of two methods
(MLN-2S).

3.3 BCov performance at strand level

The evaluation of the methods at strand level (detecting the cor—
rect B—sheet topology and B—strand pairings) is the most relevant
benchmark, as this is the main goal of all the approaches de—
veloped so far (BetaPro, NLN, CMM). In Table 4, we report the
comparison of BCov with the state—of—the—art methods on the
BetaSheet916 dataset. It is worth noticing that in this task
BCov (which is not trained on the dataset) compares well with
the other methods achieving a correlation coefﬁcient value of
0.56 (MCC). This indicates that the information extracted by
PSICOV is relevant also for the problem at hand, and if
coupled with an optimization procedure the overall accuracy
can improve signiﬁcantly. Furthermore, it is evident that

 

Note: For the legend see Table 3.

when the number of aligned sequences is sufficiently high
(Bcov 3 1000) the performances increases by 5 percentage
points and with an MCC of 7 percentage points higher than
the best state—of—the—art method. As a consequence, we may
expect that BCov performance will improve as new sequences
will be made available by mass sequencing efforts.

In Table 5, we show scoring of the different methods obtained
with the qualitative measures introduced by Lippi and Frasconi
(2009) (see Section 2.6). It is interesting to see that BCov outper—
forms all other methods with respect to all the reported indices
with the exception of the prediction of the correct directions of
the correctly predicted B—sheets. This indicates that with respect
to the other methods, BCov is better at guessing the segment
pairings and B—sheet topology but less effective at detecting the
contacts at residue level.

3.4 Performance on the CASP 2010 dataset

To evaluate the BCov performances at the strand level on an—
other benchmark, we used the CASP 2010 dataset. With this
choice we can also compare the BCov performance at the
strand level with other two state—of—the—art predictors (BetaPro
and CMM). We downloaded the protein structures provided
during the CASP 2010 experiment, and we followed the same
procedure described in Burkoff et a]. (2013) to filter out se—
quences with a number of B—residues g 10. The final set consisted
of 92 protein chains. The results reported in Table 6 are really
encouraging, as it appears that BCov6 (an unsupervised method)
compares well with the state—of—the—art methods BetaPro and
CMM [as reported from the data taken from the supplementary
material of Burkoff et a]. (2013)]. It is also worth noticing that
BCov6 MCC and F1 performances are almost unaffected by
the dataset change (compare Table 6 with indexes reported in
Tables 4 and 5).

3.5 Performance on the new BetaSheetl452 dataset

To evaluate the BCov performance on a larger and newer data—
set, in Table 7 we report the performances both at residue and at
strand level. It is encouraging that the performances are consist—
ent and comparable with those obtained using the classical
BetaSheet916 dataset (compare with Tables 375) and also the
CASP 2010 dataset (compare with Table 6). Because
BetaSheetl452 is larger than the previous dataset (far larger
than any CASP datasets, at least so far), the fact that the

performances do not degrade indicates that BCov is a robust
predictor of B—sheet topologies. In Table 7 we also report the
performance of the most recently introduced CMM method
(Burkoff et al., 2013) that was trained on the BetaSheet916 data—
set. It is worth noticing that BCov6 performs similarly at residue
level, but generally better at strand level indicating that BCov
more efﬁcient than CMM at locating the B—sheet segment pairing
(see MCC and F1 measure in Table 7).

4 CONCLUSIONS

In this article, we presented BCov, a new unsupervised method
which integrates correlated mutation analysis and integer pro—
gramming for B—sheet topology prediction. BCov well compares
with the performances of the state—of—the—art methods, such as
BetaPro, CMMs and MLNs. The main advantage of BCov is in
the identiﬁcation of the B—strand pairing and the prediction of
the B—sheet topology. This is also conﬁrmed when BCov is com—
pared with the most recently introduced method to address this
task (MCC by Burkoff et al., 2013) on the new BetaSheetl452
dataset (Table 7). It is also worth noticing that BCov might be
coupled or incorporated into more complex machine—learning
frameworks such as recurrent neural networks or MLNs, as all
the information used by BCov (or its components) is obtained at
the sequence level without training. Finally, all the experiments
carried out in this article showed once more the strength of the
correlated mutation analysis for residue contact prediction, espe—
cially when this is performed using a sparse inverse covariance
approach as the one implemented by PSICOV (Jones et a]. 2012)
or related approaches (Cocco et al., 2013; Ekeberg et a]. 2013;
Marks et al., 2011, 2012; Morcos et al., 2001; Weigt et a]. 2009).

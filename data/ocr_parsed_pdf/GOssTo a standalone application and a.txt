Note: For each organism: number of unique GO terms appearing in the GO anno—
tation; number of annotated genes; time (in minutes and seconds) required for
calculating the Resnik semantic similarity including the Random Walk
Contribution term— and gene—wise. Calculations used GO experimental evidence
codes (EXP, IDA, IPI, IMP, IGI, IEP, TAS) and i.\'_a and part_ofGO relationships.
Data downloaded in February 2014. Experiments run on AMD Opteron 6128 HE.

developed, compiled and linked at runtime. These features make
GOssTo a practical environment for both the development of
novel semantic similarity measures as well as for the calculation
of semantic similarities on a genomic scale.

GOssTo is also available online, through a clean web interface
from our server at www.paccanarolab.org/gosstoweb.
GOssToWeb provides access to the same functionalities of the
stand—alone application, allowing extensive configuration of the
experiments through a user—friendly web form. The user can
select GO evidence code, GO relationships and a genome from
the list of organisms available in UniProt—GOA. GOssToWeb
automatically fetches the most recent version of the functional
annotation from UniProt—GOA and of the GO from its official
repository, thus ensuring that the most up—to—date data are used.
Results are provided by redirecting the user to a page from which
they can be downloaded. The system can notify the user with an
email containing a link to the result download page.

2 METHODS

The downloadable version of GOssTo is bundled with six commonly used
semantic similarity measures: the term-based measures by Resnik (1999),
Lin (1998), Jiang and Conrath (1997) and GraSM (Couto and Silva,
2005); the graph-based measures simUI and simGIC (Pesquita et al.,
2008). All these measures are extended with Yang et al. (2012)
Random Walk based procedure.

The guiding principles for GOssTo’s design aimed at producing a fast
and ﬂexible software package. This resulted in a highly modularized
architecture with very low coupling between individual modules. These
modules can be readily removed or replaced without affecting the overall
behaviour of the system.

The user can interact with GOssTo either through a command-line
interface or an API. The command-line interface provides UNIX-like
console parameter options as well as an interactive menu; the API

offers access to all the functionalities in the different modules through
a set of well-defined functions. Thus, GOssTo can be used in three
different ways: as a part of a larger data-processing pipeline; as a
stand-alone application; as a static library for existing software.
For easy processing of the results, all output is presented in structured
plain text files.

GOssTo includes a powerful extension mechanism to add new seman-
tic similarity measures. A well-deﬁned interface grants the user access to
the data structures upon which new measures can be developed. After a
new measure is independently compiled, it can be dynamically linked to
GOssTo’s application core. The new measure can then be used in the
same way as the ones bundled with GOssTo. The current version of
GOssTo focuses on traditional semantic similarity measures which rely
mostly on the GO structure. Future versions will include the possibility of
handling Description Logic axioms which are being added to existing
ontologies (Ferreira et al., 2013).

GOssTo was developed using the Java programming language. The
JAMA package provides the internal data types and the required math-
ematical routines. GOssTo’s source code is freely available from GitHub
at https://github.com/pwac092/gossto and is released under the GPLv3
license. GOssTo runs on multiple platforms, and we have extensively
tested in on both GNU/Linux and Windows. More information
about GOssTo including a comprehensive manual is available from
www.paccanarolab.org/gossto

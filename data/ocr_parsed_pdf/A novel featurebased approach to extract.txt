A novel feature-based approach to extract DDIs

 

pairs that interact (positive DDI) and that do not interact (negative DDI)
expressed by the structured representations.

2.3 Features

In this section, we describe a set of novel features that are speciﬁcally
designed to exploit the strength of the structured representations. To
generate features for each candidate DDI pair, we ﬁnd the smallest syn-
tactic container (e.g. a phrase, a clause or clauses) from the structured
representation containing that pair. For example, the smallest syntactic
container of the DRUGliDRUG2 pair in Figure lb is a phrase, whereas
the smallest syntactic container of the DRUG27DRUG3 pair in
Figure 1c encloses two clauses. Given a candidate DDI pair and its syn-
tactic container, we check whether the syntactic container contains any
trigger words. If the syntactic container functions as a subject, we also
check its right verb chunk for trigger words, as there are cases in which
trigger words do not belong to the subjects but to their right verb chunks.
If no trigger word is detected, then the candidate DDI pair is skipped,
otherwise the following features are generated depending on its container
type (e.g., subject, clause):

Lexical features: are used to capture relations between each drug of the
candidate DDI pair and its surrounding tokens. These relations might
reveal the syntactic role of the drug within the phrase containing it, such
as whether the drug is a part of the coordination or is an abbreviation of
another drug. Lexical features of each drug are three tokens on the left
and three tokens on the right of that drug. Left and right tokens are
distinguished by adding _L and _R sufﬁxes, respectively. In addition, if
a token is a drug (e.g. DRUGl or DRUG2) then that token is replaced
by ‘arg’. For example, lexical features of the DRUG2 in Figure lb are:
of_L, arg_L, with_L. As DRUG2 is the last token of that phrase, there is
no feature extracted from the right side.

Phrase features: are applicable for a candidate DDI pair of which the
syntactic container is a phrase. These features are designed to capture
relations of the candidate DDI pair and trigger words that belong to the
phrase containing that pair. For each trigger word, we determine its
relative position within the phrase by checking the following cases:

0 Trigger [prep]* argl [prep]* arg2 (case 1)
o Argl [prep]* trigger [prep]* arg2 (case 2)
o Argl [prep]* arg2 [prep]* trigger (case 3)

Here prep are prepositions connecting chunks that contain the trigger
and the DDI pair. Argl and arg2 are drugs of the (ordered) candidate
DDI pair. The ‘*’ indicates that zero or more prepositions are required.
Based on the obtained case, corresponding features are generated to rep-
resent the position between the trigger and the candidate DDI pair (i.e.
left, middle or right) and to indicate which prepositions are used to con-
nect the trigger and the target pair as well as the chunks between the
drugs of the target pair. For example, features generated for the
DRUGliDRUG2 pair in Figure lb are use_0f_arg1 and arg1_-
with_arg2_case1. Furthermore, if there is a negative modiﬁer (e.g. no,
not) which belongs to the same chunk that contains a trigger, we insert
the modiﬁer as the preﬁx for that trigger.

As it is non-trivial to automatically determine which trigger actually
has a relation with (i.e. governs) the candidate DDI pair, all detected
triggers are used to generate phrase features.

Verb features: are bag-of-words (unigrams and bigrams) generated
from the verb chunk of the clause to which the candidate DDI pair
belongs. The verb features indicate how the drug in the left phrase (sub-
ject) and the drug in the right phrase (object) are related.

Syntactic features: are designed to capture the surrounding syntactic
structure of each drug of the candidate DDI pair within the phrase to
which it belongs. To do this, we assign indices for all preceding noun and
preposition chunks which connect to the noun chunk containing that
drug. Furthermore, we also check whether there is any drug succeeding

that drug and which prepositions are used to connect them. For example,
the syntactic features generated for DRUGl in Figure lb are NC], PC2,
has_mare_args and with_arg. Together with verb features, syntactic fea-
tures particularly help to distinguish between DDI pairs that have a drug
governed by its preceding noun chunks and DDI pairs that have drugs
spanning into two phrases (i.e. subject and object) of a clause. For ex-
ample, consider the positive DRUGliDRUG2 pair in Figure 1a and the
negative DRUG27DRUG3 pair in Figure lb. Although both pairs have
the same sequence of tokens, if the syntactic structure is used then
DRUGl in Figure 1a and DRUG2 in Figure lb have completely differ-
ent syntactic features.

Auxiliary features: consist of three features that capture information
related to the drugs of the target pair. In particular, the ﬁrst feature keeps
track if drug names of the pair are real names versus pronouns (e.g. these
drugs, this drug). The second feature denotes whether the drugs have the
same name, and the third feature indicates whether the target drugs are in
the same chunk.

2.4 Partitioning DDI pairs

In a previous study, Bui et a]. (2011) showed that partitioning candidate
PPI pairs based on syntactic properties and selecting partition-speciﬁc
feature improved the performance of their PPI extraction system.
Following this strategy, we categorize candidate DDI pairs into different
groups based on their syntactic containers. To reduce the number of
syntactic groups being generated, we only consider candidate DDI
pairs that span over at most two clauses. For example, the DRUGli
DRUG3 pair in Figure 1c is ignored, as it spans over three clauses. This
partitioning process results in ﬁve syntactic groups, namely subject,
object, clause, clause_2 and NP. Here clause_2 denotes a syntactic struc-
ture that spans over two clauses, and NP denotes an input sentence that
contains only a phrase.

Owing to space limitations, we refer to the Supplementary source code
for more details on text preprocessing and feature generation.

2.5 Machine learning

Recent relation extraction competitions have shown that the use of SVMs
in relation extraction systems is dominant and systems that use SVMs
achieved the best performance (Nédellec et al., 2013; Segura-Bedmar
et al., 2011a, 2013). In this study, we use the LIBSVM classifier with a
default RBF kernel (http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/ ~ cjlin/libsvm/) for clas-
siﬁcation of DDI pairs. All individual features extracted for each DDI
pair are normalized and combined into a single feature vector as pro-
posed by Miwa et a]. (2009). To find the best parameter C and gamma for
each model, we use the CVParameterSelection function from the WEKA
toolbox (http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Datasets

We use the DDI extraction 2011 and 2013 datasets (hereafter
referred to as DDI—2011 and DDI—2013) provided by the DDI
extraction 2011 and 2013 challenges to evaluate our extraction
method. Each dataset consists of two parts, a training dataset
and a test dataset. There are differences between the two chal—
lenge datasets. The DDI—2011 datasets contain documents se—
lected from the DrugBank database, whereas the DDI—2013
datasets consist of documents selected from the DrugBank data—
base and Medline abstracts. Furthermore, in the DDI—2011 data—
set, each drug pair was annotated either as a true interaction
(positive instance) or no interaction (negative instance), whereas
the DDI—2013 datasets have more ﬁne—grained annotations with

different interaction types. Statistics of the datasets are shown in
Table 1.

3.2 Transformation of datasets

When applying the text preprocessing and partitioning steps for
each dataset, we obtain a transformed dataset where irrelevant
DDI pairs are ﬁltered out and the original dataset is split into
ﬁve groups. Tables 2 and 3 show statistics of the transformed
datasets for training and test datasets, respectively. The data in
these tables indicate that the text preprocessing has effectively
ﬁltered out signiﬁcant numbers of negative instances (TNs) with
a small cost of missing positive instances (FNs). Overall, num—
bers of ﬁltered instances vary from 2.5 to 4.1% for FNs and from
27.9 to 33.8% for TNs on the DrugBank datasets. However,
numbers of FNs on the Medline dataset are unexpectedly high,
ranging from 8.6 to 17.9.0%. Furthermore, a small number of
positive instances are ignored during the partition step owing to
their complex syntactic structures. These numbers are shown in
Tables 2 and 3 as ignored cases.

In addition, the data from Tables 2 and 3 show that the num—
bers of instances vary signiﬁcantly between groups of each data—
set and across datasets. This indicates that the performance on
each group might also differ accordingly.

3.3 Evaluation settings

We use the standard evaluation measures (Precision, Recall and
F—score) proposed by the DDI extraction challenge to evaluate
the performance of our system (Segura—Bedmar et al., 2013). As
our method mainly focuses on the detection of interaction pairs,
we ignore the interaction types annotated in the DDI—2013 data—
set. (The detection of DDI pairs is an important step in the ex—
traction pipeline of most of the systems that participated in the
DDI extraction 2013 challenge, including the top two systems).
In addition, because we partition each dataset into five groups,
we need to train the classiﬁer separately for each group. To ﬁnd
the optimal feature sets for these groups, we tried various com—
binations of the proposed features. The best feature sets for each
group are shown in Table 4. These features were determined
based on the DB—2013 training set but used for all evaluations.

We evaluate the performance of our system on each test data—
set after training on the corresponding training dataset, except

for the ML—2013 test dataset. For this test dataset, the system is
trained on the combined DB—2013 and the ML—2013 training
datasets as suggested by Chowdhury and Lavelli (2013b) and
Thomas et a1. (2013).

3.4 Performance of DDI extraction

Table 5 shows the results of our system evaluated on the DDI—
2011 and DDI—2013 test datasets. To understand its performance
on different document types (i.e. DrugBank and Medline ab—
stracts), we present the results of the DDI—2013 sub datasets
separately. Furthermore, to calculate recall, all positive instances
missed by the previous preprocessing steps are considered as
FNs. Besides reporting the overall performance of the whole
dataset, we also present the performances of individual groups.
Recall for each group is calculated using data from Table 3
(which do not take into account ﬁltered and ignored instances),
whereas the recall for the overall performance for each test data—
set is calculated using data from Table 1.

The results in Table 5 show that our system performs well on
the DB—2013 and DDI—2011 test datasets with F—scores of 83.5
and 71.1%, respectively. However, its performance decreases on
the Medline test dataset with an F—score of 59.2%, which is 24.3
points lower than that of the DB—2013 test dataset. This perform—
ance decrease stems from the low recall, which can partly be
explained by the loss of positive instances during the preprocess—
ing steps. In addition, for each dataset, the performance on each
group also differs signiﬁcantly. These performance differences
might be due to three factors. First, the ratio of the positive
and negative instances varies among all groups (see Tables 2
and 3). This causes the performance degradation for groups
that have smaller positive/negative ratios (Van Hulse et al.,
2007). Second, the selection of different feature sets for various
syntactic groups may also account for the differences in perform—
ance. Third, the annotation quality of the DB—2013 is better than
that of DB—2011, which was annotated automatically without
any manual revision (Herrero—Zazo et al., 2013).

Table 6 shows the performance comparison between our
system (BioSem) and the top—performance systems participating
in the DDI—2013 extraction challenge (Task 2). The data show
that our system outperforms the top ﬁve systems on the DB—2013
test dataset with an F—score increase ranging from 0.8 to 13.2
points. While the recall of our system is lower than the best
system (81.2 versus 83.8%), its precision is signiﬁcantly higher
(85.9 versus 81.6%). Furthermore, our system also yields better
results when compared with these systems on the ML—2013 test
dataset. The results in Table 7 show that the BioSem achieves an
F—score of 59.2%, which is higher than the other systems
6.27171 points. It is worth noting that the systems that partici—
pated in the challenges had to be developed under strict time
constraints, which may have affected their performance.
Nevertheless, the authors of the top—performing systems have
participated in the DDI—2011 extraction challenge and thus
were familiar with the task and could ﬁne—tune their systems
using the DDI—2011 test dataset.

To provide a fair performance comparison, we present the
evaluation results of the best known systems that run on the
DDI—2011 post—challenge test dataset in Table 8. We also provide
the results of the best system of the DDI—2011 extraction chal—
lenge for reference. The data show that post—challenge systems
achieve higher performance in terms of F—scores as compared
with the best system of the DDI—2011 extraction challenge.
These performance improvements might stem from the fact
that these systems have a better design and/or could be ﬁne—
tuned on the available test dataset. Compared with these

in DDI—2013 challenge.

3.5 Performance analysis

In this section, we address some issues related to the performance
of the proposed system as well as discuss its complexity with
respect to the state—of—the—art systems.

3.5.] Performance variation on different datasets In the previ—
ous section, we have mentioned that the ratio of positive and
negative instances might directly contribute to the differences in
performance between syntactic groups (e.g. subject, object, etc.)
of each dataset. This phenomenon can also be observed in the
same groups across different datasets. For example, on the DB—
2013 dataset, the ratios of positive/negative instances of the
clause group are 0.83 and 1.20 for training and test datasets,
whereas on the DDI—2011 dataset these values are 0.39 and
0.38, respectively (see Tables 2 and 3). These differences might
explain why precision and recall of the clause group differs be—
tween these two datasets: 86.1 versus 65.8% for precision and
94.4 versus 84.8% for recall. Furthermore, this might also ex—
plain the high precision of the subject group on the ML—2013 test

dataset, as the positive/negative ratios between training and test
datasets are 0.11 and 1.05, respectively.

Another issue that might affect the system performance is the
size of the datasets. This is clearly visible for the ML—2013 data—
set, which is signiﬁcantly smaller (14 times) than the DB—2013
dataset. Moreover, learning a model from a small training set is
one of the challenges of an ML—based approach. This problem is
even harder in our case since we further split the training set into
ﬁve sub datasets. For example, when we used the ML—2013
dataset alone for training, our system achieved an F—score of
35.4% on the ML—2013 test dataset (data not shown).
However, when trained on the combined DB—2013 and ML—
2013 training datasets and evaluated on the ML—2013 test set,
the F—score increases to 59.2%. This indicates that even though
there are differences in structure between the document types
(Cohen et al., 2010) of two datasets, increasing the size of the
ML—2013 training set by adding training instances from the DB—
2013 set, to some extent, helps improving the performance of our
system on this test dataset.

3.5.2 Contribution of the proposed feature sets When applying
an ML—based approach for relation extraction tasks, each can—
didate pair is classiﬁed independently as being a true interaction
pair or not. The benefit of this approach is that it can easily be
used with any (binary) classiﬁer. However, when each candidate
DDI pair is considered independently, it is taken out of context.
In other words, the dependencies between the drugs of the can—
didate DDI pair and their neighboring drugs might be missed,
which might lead to a wrong classiﬁcation. For example,
consider a positive DRUGliDRUG2 pair and two negative
DRUGliDRUG3 and DRUG27DRUG3 pairs in the
sentence ‘Concurrent use of DRUGl with DRUG2 may in—
crease the effect of DRUG3’ as shown in Figure 1b. For the
DRUG27DRUG3 pair, if only lexical features are used then

Notes. The results are evaluated on the DB—2013 test dataset. Verb features are not
applicable to NP group, and phrase features are not applicable to clause and clause—
2 groups. Lex, Aux, P, R and F denote lexical, auxiliary, precision, recall and
F—score, respectively.

one may miss the information that DRUG2 has already partici—
pated in a relation with DRUGl. For the DRUGliDRUG3
pair, even if a dependency tree is used, one might still miss the
information that DRUGl has a relation with DRUG2. To ad—
dress this problem, previous systems usually combine various
types of features so that they can complement each other. In
our system, we explicitly tackle this problem by introducing
three novel feature sets, namely verb, phrase and syntactic
features.

Table 9 shows the contributions of the phrase, syntactic and
verb features on the performance of our system when evaluated
on the DB—2013 test dataset. The data show that when the verb
features are removed, the performance in terms of F—score de—
grades 3.56% compared with that of the whole feature set. While
removing the phrase or syntactic feature alone decreases the per—
formance slightly, removing both phrase and syntactic features
results in the performance decreases 1.53%. This means that one
of these features may only be suitable for certain groups. This
phenomenon is clearly visible when we apply the optimized fea—
ture sets from Table 4 to the test dataset, resulting in an increase
of 0.95% on the F—score compared with that of the whole feature
sets.

In addition, by mapping each candidate DDI pair into a syn—
tactic container before generating features, we can enhance the
lexical features by not generating unnecessary tokens surround—
ing each drug of the candidate DDI pair. For example, the
number of lexical features generated for DRUG2 in Figure 1b
is three features instead of six features for systems that use a ﬂat
structure.

3.5.3 Computational performance and complexity To increase
the performance of DDI extraction systems, most of top—per—
forming systems use either ensemble approaches (Thomas
et al., 2011, 2013) or kernel combination approaches
(Chowdhury and Lavelli, 2013b; He et al., 2013). While they
manage to increase the performances, the computational re—
sources and the complexity of their systems also increase.
Furthermore, some systems also incorporate domain knowledge
(He et al., 2013; Thomas et al., 2013) to enhance the perform—
ance, but this hinders the adaptation of these systems to new
relation extraction tasks.

In contrast, our proposed feature—based system uses a small set
of features to generate feature vectors from a simple syntactic

representation. It uses a shallow parser for analyzing input sen—
tences and requires only a single kernel to build predictive
models. Therefore, it is simpler and requires less computational
time compared with the other ML—based systems. For example,
our system requires 51 s to process the DB—2013 dataset (22s for
the text preprocessing step and 29 s for training and classifying
instances). This experiment was performed on a laptop with an
Intel Core i7—2640 M, 2.8 GHz processor.

3.5.4 Error analysis To identify the main sources of error of
our system, we analyze all errors [118 false positives (FPS), 130
FNs] produced by our system when evaluated on the DB—2013
test dataset. Overall, these errors (both FPs and FNs) can be
categorized into four groups. The ﬁrst group of errors (22 FPs,
39 FNs) is caused by parser errors or incorrect construction of
structured representations. These errors lead to the wrong cat—
egorization of candidate DDI pairs. The second error group (34
FPs) is caused by a non—deterministic context, where the syntac—
tic containers of the candidate DDI pairs alone are not enough to
determine the outcome. The third error group (42 FPs, 91 FNs)
is caused by unusual syntactic structures of the input sentences,
anaphora problems and the long distance between two drugs
(measured by the number of chunks) of the candidate DDI
pairs. The fourth error group (20 FPs) consists of cases where
candidate DDI pairs syntactically seem to be true DDI pairs.

While most of the errors are non—trivial, the errors caused by
input sentences with special syntactic structures can be tackled if
rules are defined to convert these input sentences into a form that
can be handled by the structured representation. For the other
errors, substantial changes in the system are needed to further
improve the current performance.

4 CONCLUSONS

In this study, we have proposed a novel feature—based approach
to extract DDIs from text. The key factors of our approach are
the combination of the novel feature sets and the partition of the
datasets. By partitioning the original dataset into subsets based
on their syntactic properties, we obtain more consistent sub data—
sets and can optimize feature selection for each sub dataset.
Furthermore, by combining the strength of various types of fea—
tures, our system is robust and generalizes well on different data—
sets. The evaluation results show that our system achieves better
performance than the state—of—the—art systems on various test
datasets.

Our approach is simple and more efﬁcient in terms of compu—
tational time than other ML—based systems, as it uses a small set
of features and a default SVM kernel. Furthermore, the pro—
posed feature sets are generic, except for the auxiliary feature
set. While the system is initially proposed to extract DDIs, it
can easily be adapted to other binary relation extraction tasks,
such as PPIs and genedisease relations.

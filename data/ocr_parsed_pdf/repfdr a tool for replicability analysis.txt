In step (ii) the number of parameters estimated by the EM is expo-
nential in n: if the association can be either null, or positive, or negative,
then the EM estimates 3" parameters; if the association can be either null
or non-null (e.g. only in one direction), then the EM estimates 2" param-
eters. On a computer with 12GB memory, it is possible to estimate these
parameters for n = 5 studies using 3 X 106 SNPs, or for n = 6 studies
using 106 SNPs, but there is not enough memory for n = 6 studies using
3 X 106 SNPs. Moreover, the greater the number of parameters, the
larger the amount of data (SNPs) necessary for reliably estimating the
parameters. If a large number of studies are available, we therefore rec-
ommend ﬁrst grouping the studies into fairly homogeneous clusters of
studies, then computing the meta-analysis P-value for each cluster of
studies and ﬁnally applying our software to discover the replicated ﬁnd-
ings across clusters of studies.

The implementation of repfdr (written in R and C) allows it to take
advantage of parallel processing, improving its efﬁciency. By default, the
software automatically detects the number of available processing
threads.

2.1 Example

We give a data example which is a simulation of three GWAS from the
simulator HAPGEN2 (Su et al., 2011), thus emulating real GWAS data.
Each study is summarized by the z-scores for the test of association of an
SNP with a binary outcome in the same 249024 SNPs. Our speciﬁc
question isiwhich SNPs show replicated association with the phenotype?
i.e. for which SNPs the association with phenotype is present in more
than one of the studies? In the package, it is shown how to summarize the
ﬁndings and conclude about this question.

We have 33 possible vectors of association status for each SNP. When
we test for no association, the null set is just the zero vector. We get 239
SNP discoveries at the Bayes FDR of 0.05. For replicability analysis, we
have 13 states in our null set, and we discover 119 SNPs at the Bayes
FDR of 0.05. Supplementary Figure S1 shows a Manhattan plot of the
negative logarithm of the estimated Bayes FDRs for replicability (top)
and for association (bottom) versus the genomic coordinates.

Noting that the replicability analysis ﬁndings are typically a subset of
the findings from an analysis to detect associations, SNPs may be dis-
covered only in the latter analysis for two possible reasons: either because
of insufﬁcient power for establishing replicability, or because of the
association being present only in a single study. Among these SNPs,
identiﬁcation of those with replicated association may be done using a
follow-up study that examines only these SNPs (239-119: 120 SNPs in
this example) in an independent study [e.g. using the methods in

Bogomolov and Heller (2013), implemented in the Web application
http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~ruheller/App.html].

3 CONCLUSION

In large problems where it is possible to estimate well the un—
known parameters, the empirical Bayes replicability analysis is
useful. In particular, this is so for GWAS, where discovering
SNPs with replicated associations is of great scientiﬁc interest.
Specifically, the replicability analysis using the P—values of sev—
eral published GWAS that examine the same complex disease
can shed light on the genetic architecture of the disease by iden—
tifying the SNPs that have replicated associations across studies
as well as the SNPs associated with the disease that show no
evidence (or inconsistent evidence) of replicability of associ—
ations. Our package provides a way of performing this analysis,
and the theoretical justiﬁcations are given in Heller and Yekutieli
(2014). The proposed approach is a general approach for assess—
ing replicability in several studies when each study examines the
same hypotheses. Therefore, it can be used for applications other
than GWAS, as long as the marginal and non—null densities can
still be reasonably well approximated for each study, and the
dependency of the test statistics within each study is local.

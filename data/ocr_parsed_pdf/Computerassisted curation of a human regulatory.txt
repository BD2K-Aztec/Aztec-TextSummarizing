Abstract

Motivation: A highly interlinked network of transcription factors (TFs) orchestrates the context—
dependent expression of human genes. ChlP—chip experiments that interrogate the binding of
particular TFs to genomic regions are used to reconstruct gene regulatory networks at genome—scale,
but are plagued by high false—positive rates. Meanwhile, a large body of knowledge on high—quality
regulatory interactions remains largely unexplored, as it is available only in natural language descrip—
tions scattered over millions of scientific publications. Such data are hard to extract and regulatory
data currently contain together only 503 regulatory relations between human TFs.

Results: We developed a text—mining—assisted workflow to systematically extract knowledge about
regulatory interactions between human TFs from the biological literature. We applied this workflow
to the entire Medline, which helped us to identify more than 45 000 sentences potentially describing
such relationships. We ranked these sentences by a machine—learning approach. The top—2500 sen—
tences contained ~900 sentences that encompass relations already known in databases. By manu—
ally curating the remaining 1625 top—ranking sentences, we obtained more than 300 validated regu—
latory relationships that were not present in a regulatory database before. Full—text curation
allowed us to obtain detailed information on the strength of experimental evidences supporting a
relationship.

Conclusions: We were able to increase curated information about the human core transcriptional
network by >60% compared with the current content of regulatory databases. We observed im—
proved performance when using the network for disease gene prioritization compared with the
state—of—the—art.

Computer—assisted curation of a human regulatory core network

1 Introduction

Transcription factors (TFs) inﬂuence the rates by which their target
genes are transcribed by binding to regulatory DNA—segments, like
promoter or enhancer regions (Vaquerizas et (11., 2009). In verte—
brates, the relationship between TFs and genes is complex: on one
hand, regulation of a specific gene often involves a variety of TFs,
acting in an independent, cooperative or competitive manner
(Lemon and Tjian, 2000). On the other hand, specific TFs often are
involved in the co—regulation of a multitude of target genes (Niehrs
and Pollet, 1999). Furthermore, TFs often also regulate other TFs.
These TF—TF relationships can be considered as the core of the full
human gene regulatory network (GRN) that orchestrates many cel—
lular processes by inducing or repressing genes which function is
specifically required for a given environment, for a certain cell type,
or at a certain point—in—time during development and cell differenti—
ation. Well—studied parts of this GRN are involved in wound healing
(Pratt et (11., 2008) or in development (Davidson and Erwin, 2006),
and its dys—regulation is associated with many diseases (Vaquerizas
et (11., 2009). It also has a particularly important role in cancer
(Dang, 2012; Jurchott et (11., 2010), where a highly interconnected
regulatory core network mediates different aspects of the disease
(Stelniec—Klotz et (11., 2012).

Biological research over the last decades has identified thousands
of individual regulatory interactions using specific, time—consuming
and laborious experiments. Proving a direct regulatory relationship
between a TF X and a gene Y typically comprises three individual
evidences: (E1) binding of X to a genomic location related to Y, (E2)
change in expression of Y upon activation of X, and (E3) abrogation
of regulation of Y upon removal or alteration of the binding site.
To—date, only some of these evidence types can be addressed in a
high—throughput manner. In particular, binding of TFs to genomic
DNA can be assessed on a genome—wide manner by chromatin
immune—precipitation (ChIP) followed by sequencing, as for ex—
ample has been done on a large scale by the ENCODE project
(Consortium, 2012). However, binding of TFs alone does not neces—
sarily imply that downstream genes are regulated by the TF, and
genome—wide measurements tend to be rather noisy (Waldminghaus
and Skarstad, 2010). Consequently, classical low throughput, mech—
anistic studies are still considered the most reliable way of identify—
ing regulatory interactions (Furey, 2012), and our knowledge on the
topology of the regulatory networks still remains rather sketchy
(Rottger et (11., 2012).

A central problem in compiling regulatory networks from high—
confidence low—throughput mechanistic studies is that these are scat—
tered over the large body of scientific literature. Accessing these data
in a systematic manner is difficult, as it requires finding articles
discussing such relationships, correctly identifying the involved gen—
es, and checking for each of the required evidences described earlier.
There are attempts to compile knowledge about GRNs in databases,
including the recently established TF Encyclopedia that is a commu—
nity—curated repository of information about different aspects of TFs
(Yusuf et (11., 2012). TRANSFAC (Wingender, 2008), TRRD
(Kolchanov et (11., 2002) and ORegAnno (Griffith et (11., 2008) are
more established databases specifically focusing on regulatory rela—
tionships. However, these databases do not attempt to comprehen—
sively cover the core GRN, but rather focus on particular TFs or on
specific binding sites to compile binding site motifs. Notably, these
three databases (henceforth abbreviated as RegDBs) together con—
tain only 5 03 regulatory relationships between two human TFs for
an estimated number of at least 2000 TFs in the genome (Vaquerizas
et (11., 2009). This situation is in stark contrast to e.g. Escherichia

6011', for which the RegulonDB (Collado—Vides et (11., 2009; Gama—
Castro et (11., 2008) contains 369 regulatory relationships between
the estimated 300 TFs in the genome (Vaquerizas et (11., 2009).

To enlarge the body of experimentally asserted information
about the human core GRN, we set out to develop, apply and evalu—
ate a computer—assisted workflow for systematically finding and ex—
tracting experimental evidence for direct regulatory relationships
between human TFs from the biological literature. This workﬂow
comprises a state—of—the—art software to identify and normalize gene
names in text; a machine—learning based classifier to judge whether a
sentence in which a pair of genes co—occur describes a regulatory re—
lationship between these two genes; and an extensive phase of
human curation to check the truthfulness of the classifier’s output
on the sentence level and to provide an assessment of the strength of
supporting evidences described in the containing article. We applied
our workﬂow to all abstracts in PubMed. Altogether, we identified
more than 18 million pairs of genes co—occurring in the same sen—
tence. We automatically classified each of these sentences using a
classifier trained on a manually annotated gold standard corpus of
sentences describing regulatory relationships and inspected in detail
the top—2500 sentences mentioning a pair of human TFs. 35% of
those 2500 sentences report transcriptional interactions that were al—
ready covered by RegDBs. By manual curation, we found that 660
of the remaining 1625 sentences contained interesting information
about gene regulatory relations, and further 322 sentences described
co—operation or competition in transcription. Domain experts then
studied all 459 full—text publications covering the 660 sentences to
assess the trustfulness of the relationship with respect to the three
lines of independent evidence mentioned earlier. This lead to the
identification of 128 relationships supported by all three evidences,
compared with only 35 described in the RegDBs. 310 relationships
not previously covered by RegDBs were identified that are sup—
ported by at least one of the three evidences, compared with 503
described in the RegDBs. We performed an initial characterization
of the expanded network and found it to be considerably larger,
better connected and functionally different. It also led to improved
performance when used for disease gene prioritization in four differ—
ent RNA—Seq datasets.

2 Results and discussion

2.1 A workflow to extract the core regulatory network
between human TFs

Mammalian cells harbor a complex regulatory core network of TFs
regulating each other. We were interested in compiling this core net—
work in an as—complete—as—possible manner using two sources of
knowledge: The scientific literature and existing curated regulatory
databases. We were particularly interested in comparing the respect—
ive coverage of both approaches and the quality of the network ob—
tained by merging both sources.

To extract high—quality regulatory interactions from the litera—
ture, we first compiled a list of TFs by extending a hierarchical TF
classification (Wingender et (11., 2013), and mapped the proteins to
their respective genes (see Supplementary File 51). We then applied
the workﬂow depicted in Figure 1. Mentions of TFs are identified in
all PubMed abstracts using the state—of—the—art gene name recogni—
tion tool GNAT (Hakenberg et (11., 2011). GNAT was evaluated in
several critical evaluations (Lu et (11., 2011; Morgan et (11., 2008)
and achieves, according to these assessments, a precision of 82 %
and a recall of 82 % for abstracts and precision/recall values of
54/47% for full—text articles. We identified 76 596 sentences

Fig. 1. Workflow of our approach. A classifier is trained on two gold standard
corpora and applied to all abstracts in PubMed and the Open Access portion
of PubMed Central. Positively classified sentences are partly curated manu-
ally and partly evaluated against RegulonDB

containing at least two human TFs in PubMed abstracts. Manual in—
spection of a sample of these sentences unveiled that large fractions
consists of false positives, i.e. they do not describe regulatory inter—
actions. Consequently, extracted sentences must be subjected to sub—
sequent manual curation. As doing so for 76596 sentences is not
feasible, we followed a machine—learning based approach to priori—
tize sentences for manual curation. To this end, we trained a state—
of—the—art classification algorithm on the union GeneReg and
BioNLP’09, two freely available collections of manually annotated
sentences on gene regulations. Example annotations for sentences
containing regulatory events are shown in Figure 2A.

As for the second source of knowledge, we compiled a regulatory
dataset from three well—established gene regulatory databases,
namely TRANSFAC (Wingender, 2008), TRRD (Kolchanov et al.,
2002) and ORegAnno (Griffith et al., 2008). Of these, TRANSFAC
contained the largest amount of relationships between human TFs
(373), TRRD contained 183 and ORegAnno contained 22.
Surprisingly, we found that these databases had very little overlap,
with only one relation being in all three databases (see Fig. 2B). In
total, we could extract 503 unique regulatory interactions from
these RegDBs, which we consider as a surprisingly low number,
given that the human genome contains more than 2000 sequence—
specific TFs.

2.2 The workflow extracts functional regulatory
interactions from abstracts with high precision
Out of 23 140 530 Medline sentences, 3 449 157 contained at least
two proteins and 76 5 96 contained at least two human TFs. When
we applied our classifier to the latter set of sentences, it labeled

48 901 as positive (see Fig. 3A). We sorted the corresponding pairs
of TFs by classifier’s confidence on supporting sentences and further
curated abstracts and full articles (see next section) of the top—2500
pairs. We removed all pairs which were already contained in any of
the RegDBs. We then asked domain experts to manually curate the
remaining 1625 sentences (for detailed statistics see Supplementary
Table S1 and Supplementary File S2). Curators found 660 (40.6%)
sentences clearly indicating that the respective article describes a
regulatory interaction between human TFs. We also asked the cur—
ators to assess the types of experiment evidence provided in the re—
spective article (see Fig. 3C). Interestingly, much more publications
describe regulation of expression (E2) and mutational analysis (E3)
than binding of a TF (E1) (see Fig. 3B). Further 322 (19.8%) sen—
tences were found to describe cooperativity or competition between
the two TFs on a common target gene, thus hinting towards a func—
tional relationship.

Of all 1625 manually inspected sentences, 643 (39.6%) con—
tained no evidence that the article contains any information about a
regulatory relationship. Thus, the precision of our text mining pipe—
line on the top—2500 pairs can be estimated at 74.3% also counting
those pairs as positive that were already contained in one of the
RegDBs, or 60.4% when only considering TF—pairs not in current
databases. We also investigated how the truly interesting sentences
are distributed among all ranked sentences. Figure 3D shows the
precision, recall and F1—measure at increasing rank of the curated
sentence. It is reassuring for our approach that high ranks show
considerably higher precision than low ranking predictions. As the
recall is not saturating, curating further sentences will most likely
unveil much more regulatory relations (work ongoing). To exclude a
bias incurred by differences between the human experts which per—
formed the manual curation, we also compared the proportions of
their different evaluation results. Overall, reviewers obtained fairly
similar percentages of the different evaluation outcomes (see
Supplementary Table S2).

2.3 Manual curation of full texts establishes a high—
confidence regulatory network of human cells

In the first round of manual evaluation, sentences were only assessed
by the question whether or not they indicate that the article they are
contained in provide experimental evidence for a regulatory rela—
tionship between the two given TFs. In a second round of curation,
we studied in detail the full text of all 45 9 publications containing at
least one of the 660 relevant sentences to collect regulatory relation—
ship that have sufficient experimental evidence in the article. Each
evidence was manually classified according to the type of experi—
ments that were reported on in the article. This led to the identifica—
tion of 310 distinct TF—TF relationships supported by at least one of
the three evidences, including 128 relationships supported by all
three evidences, and 82 supported by exactly two. It is worth noting
that some of the reviewed full—text publications contained additional
annotations which had not been found in the abstracts, leading to
additional support of already known pairs.

In contrast, the RegDBs to—date contain 5 03 TF—TF relationships
supported by at least one evidence, but only 37 relationships sup—
ported by all three evidences (Fig. 3E, yellow bars). Furthermore,
the vast majority of regulations in the databases, 352 out of 503, are
solely supported by experiments showing a binding of a TF to the
promoter region of another TF (E1). The reliability of these inter—
actions remains unclear (Waldminghaus and Skarstad, 2010),
rendering those relationships less valuable from a biological point—
of—view. In contrast, altogether 189 TF—TF relationships found by

investigate all sentences with co—occurrence of two TFs of a specific
subnetwork. We focused on a list of 19 liver—enriched TFs (Tomaru
et al., 2009), for which we obtained 1435 sentences from 781 publi—
cations mentioning at least two of these 19 factors. We then manu—
ally curated all these sentences, without using a classifier for
filtering. Interestingly, only 61 (4.3%) of these 1435 sentences actu—
ally contained evidence for a regulatory relationship. This is in stark
contrast to results from the classification, where 660 pairs out of
1625 (39.4%) were manually evaluated as relevant. These data sug—
gest that our approach using top—ranked pairs increases the precision
roughly 10—fold compared with pure co—occurrence and thus drastic—
ally reduces the amount of time needed to find and curate
regulations.

For this particular 19—node subnetwork, only 12 interactions were
found in the three databases, and the curation of the 25 00 sentences
led to the discovery of 10 additional interactions (see Fig. 4A). The
full analysis of all sentences with co—occurring TF pairs yielded only
seven additional connections, but required curation of 1435 sen—
tences—a hard—earned improvement. By focusing on this set of 1435
sentences, we also systematically assessed classifier performance in

curve. Sentences with a high classifier score show a precision of about
0.4, and sentences with a positive score have a recall of 0.75 at a preci—
sion above 0.1 (see Fig. 4B). Similarly, the ROC—curve shows a very
low false—positive rate at classifier scores above 1, and a false—positive
rate of 0.35 at score 0 (see Fig. 4C).

2.5 Initial characterization of the human core regulatory
network

As our approach has reconstructed the largest available GRN for
human cells curated from low—throughput experiments so far, we
were highly interested in the topological properties of the network.
We found that the data obtained through our curation pipeline does
not only increase the number of regulatory relationships in the
human core network, but it also considerably changes the scope and
structure of the network.

As shown in Table 1, the number of interactions increases by
~60% and the number of TFs contained in the network increase by
~30% compared with those previously described in a RegDB. The
density of the network raises considerably; the average degree of
nodes increases from 3.58 to 4.38 (both in—degree—the number of
TFs regulating a TF—and out—degree—the number of TFs that regu—
late other TFs—increases, see Fig. 5B). The expanded network is
better connected (from 10 to 9 connected components), and the
diameter shrinks from 10 to 9. Thus, our workﬂow both increases
the number of TFs captured by the network and the amount of
knowledge on each TF within the network.

Figure 5A shows the full network, combining RegDBs and the
novel curated data. Nodes whose betvveenness centrality score is the
highest, i.e. hubs in the network, are colored. Such genes have fre—
quently been associated to the onset of genetic diseases (Ideker and
Sharan, 2008) and, in particular, cancer (Li et al., 2012). The lists of
the top—10 genes ranked by betweenness—centrality for either net—
work are shown in Table 2. Although several known regulatory
hubs like SP1, FOS, MYC and P53 show high betvveenness in both
networks, a number of important cancer genes, like BRCA1, MYB
and ESR1, rank highly only in the new combined network. A par—
ticular interesting case is HOXD13, which ranks highly in the com—
bined network, but is not even contained in the RegDB network.
These cases point to a bias in the selection of TFs and regulatory re—
lationships that are included into a RegDB. To investigate publica—
tion bias in our network due to occurrence in current literature, we
counted the occurrence of each TFs in PubMed, and plotted it
against the degree of the nodes. Clearly, degree and occurrence in
PubMed correlate (see Fig. 5C), indicating that the degree of TFs in
the network is largely determined by how intensely a TF is investi—
gated in the research community. However, such publication bias is
evidently inevitable for any literature—based approach, including all
literature—curated databases.

Analysis of the E.coli GRN has unveiled that certain wiring pat—
terns, so—called network motifs, are recurrent (Shen—Orr et al.,
2002). One of the most important over—represented pattern is feed—
forward loops by which a TF regulates a target both directly and
indirectly through a second TF. This motif, for instance, has been
implicated in sign—sensitive delays in signal processing or response
acceleration (Mangan and Alon, 2003). We applied motif analysis
(Wernicke and Rasche, 2006) to test if specific three—node network
motifs are over—represented also in the human core network.
Similarly to E.coli, we found that feed—forward loop patterns, in
their different ﬂavors, are the only 3—node network motifs that are
strongly over—represented (Fig. 5D, Z> 3, P < 0.01). Interestingly,
some of these feed—forward loops contain two—node feedbacks, by
which two TFs that are within the feed—forward loop motif mutually
regulate each other.

2.6 Effects on gene prioritization in four cancertypes

To test the effect of the expanded network on a typical experimental
data analysis procedure, we obtained RNA—Seq datasets from four
types of human cancer (lung, prostate, liver and lung) together with
corresponding healthy tissue samples from The Cancer Genome
Atlas Research Network (2013). For each cancer type, we per—
formed a network biology analysis which has proven more robust
for obtaining cancer—associated genes than conventional gene—based
differential analysis in several studies (Fuller et al., 2007; Ideker and
Krogan, 2012; Ortutay and Vihinen, 2009; Taylor et al., 2009;
Winter et al., 2012). Therein, correlation values between genes in
each sample first are mapped to a regulatory network build from
background knowledge. Next, genes in each network, i.e. healthy
and cancerous, are ranked according to their graph centrality. The
final ranking of genes is obtained by assessing the change in the cen—
trality rank and compared with sets of genes known to be very likely
associated to the respective cancer. Results are considerably better
in three out of the four cases and on—a—par in the forth, when using
the expanded network as background compared with using the
RegDB network (see Fig. 6). To test whether these improvements
could be artefacts of the increased network size, we also created
randomized networks of the same size and performed the same ana—
lysis. In three cases, results of the curated network are significantly
better than expected by chance; in the forth case, results are still bet—
ter but not significantly (P—value cutoff 0.05).

2.7 A database of human TF—TF regulatory relationships
The data assembled from several databases (e.g. TRANSFAC,
TRRD, ORegAnno) and our manual curation efforts was aggregated
into a database, which is accessible by our web—service FastForward
available at http://fastforward.sys—bio.net/. The web—service allows
users to search for proteins as regulators or as targets of an arbitrary

3 Conclusions

Consistently verified knowledge on human regulatory relationships
is still scarce and only achievable through costly low throughput ex—
periments. Nevertheless, such knowledge is of utmost importance
for further advancing research in human regulatory processes; this is
especially true when serving as background knowledge in the ana—
lysis of high—throughput datasets. Here, we presented a text—mining
assisted pipeline for targeted curation of a human core

transcriptional network. We showed that using this pipeline pro—
vides a much less costly (in terms of human labor hours) approach
to the curation of regulatory relationships. Furthermore, we applied
our pipeline to abstracts from Medline and could thus, after an ex—
tensive manual post—processing step, generate the (to the best of our
knowledge) largest human TF network available today. Initial re—
sults of studying the properties of this network and using it in sys—
tems biology evaluations show promising results. Curation of the
literature following our pipeline is ongoing and should lead to fur—
ther growth of our datasets in the near future.

4 Materials and methods

4.1 TF classification

We assembled a list of human TFs as follows. We started with a list
of 1690 human TFs and their respective isoforms from (Wingender
et al., 2013) in the version present on the following website: http://
www.edgar—wingender.de/huTF_classification.html, version: June
19, 2011. We expanded this list by an additional 274 human TFs
assembled from literature, TRANSFAC, TRRD and ORegAnno.
HGNC gene names collected from literature are mapped to Entrez
Gene identifiers using BioMart (Haider et al., 2009). Mappings
retrieved by BioMart are than manually evaluated for correctness.
Our final list comprised 1056 unique Entrez Gene identifiers of
human TFs.

4.2 Curated regulatory databases

We compiled the existing knowledge for interactions between
human TFs from the following regulatory databases (RegDBs):
TRANSFAC [(Wingender, 2008), Release 12.1], TRRD (Kolchanov
et al., 2002) and ORegAnno (Griffith et al., 2008). We considered
only relationships which were annotated with supporting evidence
through at least one low—throughput experiment (e.g. no high dens—
ity Chip—Chip) and at least one publication. Supporting experiments
were classified into one or more of the three evidences categories
(see Supplementary File S3).

4.3 Corpora for training the sentence classifier

We train predictive models for recognizing binary regulatory rela—
tionships in text using two existing corpora: First, we used the
GeneReg corpus [version 1.0; (Buyko et al., 2010)], which is a set of
314 manually annotated Medline abstracts about gene regulation in
E.coli. We considered all interactions having a gene/protein as regu—
lator, yielding 1164 positive pairs. The remaining 1616 pairs were
used as negative examples. Second, we used the bio—molecular event
corpus of the BioNLP’09 Shared Task (Kim et al., 2009) consisting
of 951 abstracts that were selected by MeSH terms ‘Human’, ‘Blood
cells’ and ‘Transcription Factor’. Of all annotated relationships, we
considered all cases where the expression of a protein is regulated by
another protein as positive, resulting in 295 positive and ~10 000
negative training examples. Classifiers often tend to keep the same
positive to negative ratio seen in the training phase (Chawla et al.,
2004). We counteracted this problem by applying higher penalty
costs for errors in the minority class (Veropoulos et al., 1999).

4.4 Classifying TF—pairs in sentences

We applied the relation extraction library described in (Tikk et al.,
2013) to identify regulatory relationships between pairs of genes
within a sentence. This library integrates sentence parsers (syntax
and dependency), format conversion routines, experiment manage—
ment and 13 algorithms for supervised relationship classification.

Based on the results from (Tikk et al., 2010), we used the two best
performing methods in our experiments: First, the shallow linguistic
[SL; (Giuliano et al., 2006)] kernel builds high—dimensional context
profiles based on words, stems and POS tags in near proximity of
the mentions and in the sentence containing the pair. Second, the
all-paths graph [APG; (Airola et al., 2008)] kernel requires that
sentences are first parsed to derive their dependency structure
(de Marneffe and Manning, 2008). APG then uses all features from
the SL classifier plus features derived from all paths connecting the
mentions in the dependency graphs.

4.5 Cu ration

We tagged all abstracts from PubMed (as of June 2010) using
GNAT (Hakenberg et al., 2011). We removed all sentences which
do not contain at least two human TFs and classified each remaining
pair using our classifier described earlier. Positively classified pairs
were ranked according to the classifiers confidence, and the top—
25 00 were selected as candidates for further evaluation. For manual
curation, we filtered all candidates that were already present in
TRANSFAC, TRRD or ORegAnno and also those candidates that
were mentioned in publications already curated in one of these
knowledge bases. The remaining 1625 candidate sentences were
randomly split into five parts and manually evaluated by domain ex—
perts for evidence of regulatory relationships.

We adopted a two—phase curation, where in the first phase the
experts had to judge if the sentence suggests that the article contains
information about gene regulatory interactions, and in a second
phase the experts read the full—text articles. The final network was
then constructed using only those interactions where curators found
experimental evidence for regulatory interactions in the full texts.
To assess the benefit of our classification—based approach compared
with simple co—occurrence, we also curated all 1435 sentences con—
taining two different TFs from a list of 19 liver enriched TFs
(Tomaru et al., 2009), irrespectively of how these sentences were
classified.

4.6 Network construction

For network analysis, we mapped TFs to vertices and regulatory re—
lationships to edges in a graph. One obstacle in analyzing the ex—
tracted relationships in this manner is that TFs are often complexes
of proteins. For example, the TF AP—1 describes a complex that con—
tains a protein of the FOS family, and a protein of the JUN family.
To provide the highest level of detail for different types of analysis,
we retained the information if a TF was a single protein or a com—
plex during curation (and in our database) by means of our hierarch—
ical classification scheme (Wingender et al., 2013). For network
analysis, we decided to map the TFs to the genes that encode the
proteins contained in the TFs for network analysis. Thereby, we gen—
erated a network between genes, and each link between a TF and a
target gene may become multiple links if the TF is a complex, or can
contain several members of a family of proteins.

4.7 Differential centrality analysis

RNA—Seq dataset for healthy and cancerous samples were obtained
from the Cancer Gene Atlas (Accession ids: lung adenocarcinoma,
LUAD; prostate adenocarcinoma, PRAD; liver hepatocellular car—
cinoma, LIHC; breast invasive carcinoma, BRCA). Spearman correl—
ation of gene expression values within healthy and cancerous
samples, respectively, where computed and added as edge weights to
a background network of TF5. The centrality of TFs in the two net—
works per cancer was compared and TFs were finally ranked by the

Diff—K measure (Fuller et al., 2007). We compared these ranked lists
to cancer—specific gene lists obtained from MalaCards (Rappaport
et al., 2013) to assess the ability of the background network to re—
cover known TF—disease associations. For evaluating the usefulness
of our curation approach, we performed this analysis twice, using
once the Reg—DB network as background and once the expanded
network, and compared results.

Furthermore, we tested if the observed improvements are only
an effect of the increased network size, but not due to specific novel
TFs and relationships. To this end, we generated randomized net—
works as competitors for the expanded network as follows. We
started with the Reg—DB network, as it is the common core con—
tained in all networks considered here. We added as many TFs as
the expanded network has more than the Reg—DB network, drawn
randomly from our list of human TFs. In this process, the chance to
draw a specific TF from the list equals its relative occurrence in
PubMed. We then computed a random mapping between the add—
itional TFs in the expanded network and the randomly chosen add—
itional TFs in the randomized network and added as many random
edges to each added TFs in the randomized network as its counter—
part has in the expanded network. We generated 100 networks for
each cancer type following this procedure and computed the distri—
bution of recovery rates (see Fig. S1 in Supplementary Materials).

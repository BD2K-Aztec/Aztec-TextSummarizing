Abstract

Motivation: In any macromolecular polyprotic system—for example protein, DNA or RNA—the iso—
electric point—commonly referred to as the pl—can be defined as the point of singularity in a titra—
tion curve, corresponding to the solution pH value at which the net overall surface charge—and
thus the electrophoretic mobility—of the ampholyte sums to zero. Different modern analytical bio—
chemistry and proteomics methods depend on the isoelectric point as a principal feature for pro—
tein and peptide characterization. Protein separation by isoelectric point is a critical part of 2—D gel
electrophoresis, a key precursor of proteomics, where discrete spots can be digested in—gel, and
proteins subsequently identified by analytical mass spectrometry. Peptide fractionation according
to their pl is also widely used in current proteomics sample preparation procedures previous to the
LC—MS/MS analysis. Therefore accurate theoretical prediction of plwould expedite such analysis.
While such pl calculation is widely used, it remains largely untested, motivating our efforts to
benchmark pl prediction methods.

Results: Using data from the database PIP—DB and one publically available dataset as our reference
gold standard, we have undertaken the benchmarking of pl calculation methods. We find that
methods vary in their accuracy and are highly sensitive to the choice of basis set. The machine—
Iearning algorithms, especially the SVM—based algorithm, showed a superior performance when
studying peptide mixtures. In general, learning—based pl prediction methods (such as Cofactor,
SVM and Branca) require a large training dataset and their resulting performance will strongly
depend of the quality of that data. In contrast with Iterative methods, machine—learning algorithms
have the advantage of being able to add new features to improve the accuracy of prediction.

1 Introduction

In a titration curve, the isoelectric point (pI) is the value at which
the overall net surface charge of a macromolecular polyprotic spe—
cies equals zero. Protein pI values are amongst the most widely
determined and widely reported quantities in all of biochemistry
and proteomics. The pI is obtained as essentially incidental informa—
tion during isoelectric focusing (IEF) experiments, free flow electro—
phoresis (FFE), capillary electrophoresis, and in—gel electrophoresis
experiments using IPG strips (Audain et al., 2014; Ramos et al.,
2008). Electrophoresis—based separation of proteins and peptides in
both free—flow and gel systems has been adapted to a wide variety of
proteomics platforms in order to reduce the complexity of the
studied proteome (Ramos et al., 2008, 2011). In addition to the
resolution and dynamic range of the fractionation technique, com—
bining the electrophoretic separation of proteins with mass spec—
trometry analysis provides an orthogonal analytical method for
improving protein identification in different workflows (Perez—
Riverol et al., 2013).

Assuming a protein to be denatured, theoretical calculation of the
pI is typically rapid, requiring only the sequence as input (Cargile et al.,
2004). Most techniques exploit tabulated pKEl values for the different
ionizable amino acid residues; such values are assumed to be constant
regardless of structural context (Maldonado et al., 2010). Many au—
thors have reported different values for the pKas of protein side chains
and most of them are derived from measurements of side chains in iso—
lated amino acids or from model compounds; as well as values derived
from ionizable side chains in situ (Bjellqvist et al., 1993; Lengqvist
et al., 2011). As many such alternative theoretical methods have been
proposed, the calculation of protein pI values is in urgent need of
benchmarking, since its accuracy remains largely untested. Extant com—
parison has been exiguous, using very small datasets (Patrickios and
Yamasaki, 1995), peptides rather than proteins (Cargile et al., 2004;
Lengqvist et al., 2011) or has reported poor accuracy (Henriksson
et al., 1995; Patrickios and Yamasaki, 1995).

We have previously described the database PIP—DB (Bunkute
et al., 2015), a collection of proteins, with associated experimentally
determined pI values, as collated from the literature (Bunkute et al.,
2015). In this paper, we use PIP—DB as a gold standard reference for
comparison, and describe the benchmarking of protein pI predic—
tion. We also include a peptide dataset to evaluate the performance
of pI prediction methods when estimating peptide pIs, due to the im—
portance of properly assessing the accuracy of such prediction. As
previously we combine different methods with different parameter
values. Specifically, we evaluated five isoelectric point prediction al—
gorithms: Iterative (Maldonado et al., 2010; Patrickios and
Yamasaki, 1995), Bjellquivst (Bjellqvist et al., 1993; Cargile et al.,
2008), Cofactor (Cargile et al., 2008), SVM (Perez—Riverol et al.,
2012) and Branca (Branca et al., 2014); using, where appropriate, a
set of alternate values for ionizable amino acid side chain pKas.

2 Methods

Five different isoelectric point prediction algorithms were evaluated:
Iterative (Maldonado et al., 2010; Patrickios and Yamasaki, 1995),
Bjellquivst (Bjellqvist et al., 1993; Cargile et al., 2008), Cofactor
(Cargile et al., 2008), SVM (Perez—Riverol et al., 2012) and Branca
(Branca et al., 2014). The iterative model only considers the contri—
bution of individual pKEl values to the Henderson—Hasselbach equa—
tion (Patrickios and Yamasaki, 1995 ). The Bjellquivst (Bjellqvist
et al., 1993) algorithm is based on determining the pKEl differences
between closely related amino acids, and it was the first algorithm

to propose a different pKEl value depending on the amino acid pos—
ition in the sequence. The Cofactor algorithm (Cargile et al., 2008)
accounts for the effect of adjacent amino acids :3 residues away
from a charged aspartic or glutamic acid and the C—terminus, as well
as applying a correction term to the corresponding pKEl values.
Perez—Riverol and co—workers (Perez—Riverol et al., 2012) proposed
a support vector machine approach to predict the isoelectric point of
peptides in electrophoretic experiments based on amino acid se—
quences and AAIndex properties. The Branca method (Branca et al.,
2014) uses pKEl value correction considering the influence of neigh—
boring ionizable groups up to six residues away, multiplying each
correction factor by the charged fraction of the neighboring ioniz—
able group before applying it to the initial pKEl value. It also intro—
duces the use of a statistical correction factor that depends on the
number and type (Asp or Glu) of carboxylic acid side chains in the
sequence.

Different pKEl values were evaluated for each method: for the
iterative algorithm we include multiple pKEl sets reported previously
(Supplementary Information, Table 1). The Bjellquivst method
was evaluated using different pKEl correction factors for C— and N—
terminus (Calibrated (Gauci et al., 2008), Expasy (Gasteiger et al.,
2003), Skoog and default (Bjellqvist et al., 1993)). The algorithms
Cofactor and SVM were evaluated using the default values reported
in the corresponding publications. The Branca algorithm was used
with the flag chonstantLplain set, and without considering add—
itional chemical modification in the polypeptide sequence (for ex—
ample, peptides derivatized with iTRAQ or TMT reagents).
Detailed information of each estimation method can be found in
Supplementary Information 51.

2.1 le R-package

To facilitate analysis of isoelectric point prediction for peptides and
proteins, an R package (pIR) was developed using standard best
practices for bioinformatics software development (Leprevost et al.,
2014; Perez—Riverol et al., 2014). It provides several datasets used in

4 Discussion

Our benchmarking comparison constitutes a strong blind test, since
no method is in any way optimized for this particular data set and
all the proteins and corresponding isoelectric points were collected
from different sources and correspond to distinct analytical settings.
The present study demonstrates that the algorithms from Bjellqvist
et al. and Perez—Riverol et al. represent the most accurate algorithms
overall for computing protein isoelectric points. The results also
demonstrate that when other pKEl sets are employed no significant
differences were seen for the Bjellqvist et al. approach, and most of
the small differences observed can be related to specific analytical
conditions specific to the experiment. The poor performance of all
evaluated algorithms for the single value protein dataset is alarming.
There are several possible explanations for this behaviour. The data—
set was evaluated using a variety of methods over many decades.
Thus the intrinsic variation will arise both from true biological vari—
ation (the presence of unknown processed or truncated proteins or
proteins with charged post—translational modifications, etc.) and
other errors introduced by a gallimaufry of different experimental
protocols, each with distinct and incommensurable calibration. The
low correlation between experimental and predicted values throws
serious doubt on the veracity of many theoretical studies of isoelec—
tric point distributions in whole proteomes, such as the studies by
Wu et al. (2006) and Carugo (2007), and any arguments made on
that basis. An alternative exegesis posits that PIP—DB must contain a
large number of annotation errors, as introduced during database
construction, which seriously contaminates the result. This is clearly
possible, if highly unlikely.

In IEF gels or SDS—PAGE experiments, it is common to find the
same polypeptide instance through multiple experimental fractions,
due to diffusion phenomena, or from uneven cutting during band
excision across of the gel. In addition, the peptides or proteins could
have precipitated out of solution during migration from the well to
the appropriate pH in the gel.

Possible aggregation and degradation could contribute to en—
hance inappropriate focalization, making it difficult to correctly in—
terpret the results obtained. It has also been shown that not only the
amino acid composition but also its subsequent modification can in—
fluence the accurate estimation of the isoelectric point, e.g. common
modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation which might
lead to the shielding of surface charges (as previously described in
Section 3.3). PIP—DB illustrates this complex scenario as shown
in the Table 3. It contains multiple proteins that may be ‘detectable’
in both acid and basic region, showing a wide focalization zone.
Most pI prediction methods do not take into account such ‘artifacts’
and will thus fail to make accurate estimates.

These results also highlight the need for a complete and customiz—
able tool that can provide all available algorithms and pKEl sets for iso—
electric point analysis. The machine—learning algorithms, especially the
SVM—based algorithm, showed a superior performance when studying
peptide mixtures. In general, learning—based pI prediction methods
(such as Cofactor, SVM and Branca) require a large training dataset
and their resulting performance will strongly depend of the quality of
that data. Even though Cofactor and Branca algorithms are based on
learning approaches, it is not possible to retrain these algorithms with
different datasets. In this sense, the SVM approach shows more ‘ﬂexibil—
ity’ in pI computation, and this feature can improve prediction accur—
acy. In contrast with Iterative methods, machine—leaming algorithms

have the advantage of being able to add new features to improve predic—
tion. Considering the amount of pKEl sets reported to date, use of the
Iterative approach provides a good opportunity to find some variant
that fits well with particular experimental conditions. In the near future,
new algorithms and bioinformatics tools should be able to provide a
way of choosing different pKEl sets and thus obtain more accurate pre—
diction for a given analytical setting. The SVM and Cofactor methods
should only be used where a high number of sequences are studied and
can thus be used to train the algorithms. We observed notable ﬂuctu—
ations in pI predictions for Iterative methods on a small dataset, show—
ing this method to be sensitive to small changes in the amino acid pKEl
values used. Moreover, the algorithm fails when certain pKEl values are
missing. We envisage that more algorithms based on machine learning,
including new additional features, should be explored allowing the de—
velopment of fast, accurate and reliable pI calculation algorithms for
use in future protein and peptide proteomic analysis.

changes when comparing the cases and controls as groups. Our method
works by first computing a z score for each probe in each sample:

gilt _ “control
Zik = —
Umntml

where ‘1” indexes the probe (1' = 1 . . . s), ‘k’ indexes the sample (k = 1 . . . N),
‘eik’ is the expression value of the it“ probe (typically log transformed
units) in the klh sample, ‘n’ and ‘a’ are the mean expression and standard
deviation for the 1*h probe in the control samples, respectively. Individual
probes are selected if they pass a z-score cutoff, zculoff. The number of
samples in which a probe passes this selection criterion is denoted as m,-.
The zculoff can be set to a low value, e.g 1.5, to include large number of
probes to begin with.

Once we have computed m,- for each probe, we use a binomial model to
filter the probes. If ‘q’ is the selection probability for a sample
q = P(|z| : 2mm), then the probability of selecting m,- samples under
the binomial model is as follows:

17(q,mi, N) = NCm.q""'(1 — q)”’""'

The individual z-scores computed previously that pass the cutoffs are all
treated equally (in q). We can then explicitly compute a P-value asso-
ciated with selecting m,- samples under this model:

N
M 2 minim = Z NCMWI — q)”:
nzm;

Because there are ‘s’ probes, we use a Bonferroni or False Discovery Rate
correction to control for false-positives. The probes that pass a cutoff
(0.05) after correction are the probes of interest. The algorithm essentially
is the same for selection of only upregulated or downregulated probes.
Only the calculation of q and m,- are changed to reﬂect the directionality.
In this case, ‘q’ represents only one tail of the normal distribution, and
only those samples that satisfy the direction as well as the cutoff are
included in m,-.

3 RESULTS

We applied this method to select differentially expressed probes
in 190 SPMS samples against 30 age— and gender—matched
healthy controls. A standard differential analysis using the
LIMMA package does not identify any probes as significant
(at a fold—change cutoff of 1.5). On the other hand, using our

approach, we select 1752 probes from the same dataset. Using
simple PCA of the entire transcriptome we cannot discover any
substructure in this patient population and there is no clear dis—
tinction from controls (Fig. 1A). However, when we apply PCA
to our selected 1752 probes, two major subgroups can be easily
identiﬁed, and one of these subgroups is clearly distinct from
controls (Fig. 1B).

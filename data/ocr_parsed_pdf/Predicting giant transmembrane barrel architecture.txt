ABSTRACT

Motivation: The ﬁ-barrel is a ubiquitous fold that is deployed
to accomplish a wide variety of biological functions including
membrane-embedded pores. Key influences of ﬁ-barrel lumen
diameter include the number of ﬁ-strands (n) and the degree of shear
(S), the latter value measuring the extent to which the ﬁ-sheet is
tilted within the ﬁ-barrel. Notably, it has previously been reported
that the shear value for small antiparallel ﬁ-barrels (r1524) typically
ranges between n and 2n. Conversely, it has been suggested that
the ﬁ-strands in giant antiparallel ﬁ-barrels, such as those formed
by pore forming cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDC), are parallel
relative to the axis of the ﬁ-barrel, i.e. S20. The $20 arrangement,
however, has never been observed in crystal structures of small
ﬁ-barrels. Therefore, the structural basis for how CDCs form a
ﬁ-barrel and span a membrane remains to be understood.

Results: Through comparison of molecular models with
experimental data, we are able to identify how giant CDC ﬁ-barrels
utilize a ‘near parallel’ arrangement of ﬁ-strands where S=n/2.
Furthermore, we show how side-chain packing within the ﬁ-barrel
lumen is an important limiting factor with respect to the possible
shear values for small ﬁ-barrels (r1524 ﬁ-strands). In contrast, our
models reveal no such limitation restricts the shear value of giant
ﬁ-barrels (n>24 ﬁ-strands). Giant ﬁ-barrels can thus access a
different architecture compared with smaller ﬁ-barrels.

1 INTRODUCTION

The ﬂ-barrel structure is central to a large number of functionally
diverse proteins. ﬂ-Barrels are deployed as enzymes [e.g. the outer
membrane protease, OmpT (Vandeputte-Rutten et (11., 2001)], as
water-soluble transport proteins [e.g. lipocalins (Breustedt et (11.,
2005)], as ﬂuorescent proteins [e.g. green ﬂuorescent protein (Yang
et (11., 1996)] and as membrane-embedded Channels [e.g. porins
(Weiss and Schulz, 1992)].

The properties of small ﬂ-barrels have been well-Characterized. In
particular, the shear value (S) of the ﬂ-barrel describes the stagger
of individual ﬁ-strands. For a given number of ﬁ-strands (n), the

greater the shear value, the greater the slope each ﬁ-strand is relative
to the axis of the (3 -barrel lumen. Conversely, the lower the S -va1ue,
the Closer to parallel the ﬁ-strand is relative to the axis of the (3-
barrel lumen (Supplementary Fig. S1). (A shear value of 0 results
in ﬁ-strands that lie parallel to the barrel lumen.) Most importantly,
when the number of ﬂ-strands and the shear value is known for a (3-
barrel, the diameter can be calculated for cylindrical ﬂ-barrels with
a high degree of accuracy (McLaChlan, 1979; Murzin et (11., 1994a).

For small ﬂ-barrels (11324) that are structurally Characterized,
the S-value of these structures lies between 11 and 2n (Murzin
et (11., 1994b; Nagano et (11., 1999; Schulz, 2002). To date,
the structures of over 190 transmembrane ﬂ-barrels have been
determined (Fairman et (11., 2011); analysis of these data reveal
that membrane ﬂ-barrels obey the same structural rules observed
for their soluble counterparts. A subset of transmembrane ﬂ-barrels
includes structures that are formed by homo-oligomerization.
Examples of such ﬂ-barrels include TolC (Koronakis et (11., 2000)
and ﬂ-pore forming toxins such as a-haemolysin (Song et (11.,
1996).

Although membrane ﬂ-barrels have contributed to our
understanding of small ﬂ-pore forming toxins, less is known about
the giant homo-oligomeric ﬂ-barrel pores formed by members
of the Cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDC)/Membrane Attack
Complex/Perforin (MACPF) superfamily (Hotze and Tweten, 2011;
Rosado et (11., 2008). This superfamily includes key bacterial
virulence factors produced by Gram positive bacteria as well as
the major immune effectors of mammals (Kondos et (11., 2010). No
crystal structure of a MACPF or CDC pore has been determined to
date, however, the 28 A resolution cryo-electron microscopy (EM)
structure of pneumolysin reveals that this CDC forms a giant 240 A
diameter ﬂ-barrel that contains 38 monomers (Tilley et (11., 2005).
To make this ﬂ-barrel, each pneumolysin monomer contributes two
amphipathic ﬂ-hairpins, i.e. four antiparallel ﬁ-strands (Shatursky
et (11., 1999; Shepard et (11., 1998).

Initial models presented through EM studies of the CDC,
pneumolysin, suggested that the ﬁ-strands are parallel to the lumen
in order to reach and fully span the lipid bilayer as a (3 -barrel (Tilley
et (11 ., 2005). However, such an arrangement would not be consistent
with a shear value between 11 and 2n as observed in the known
crystal structures of transmembrane ﬂ-barrels (Pali and Marsh, 2001;
Schulz, 2002). Here, using molecular models, we show that the
optimal shear value of these giant ﬂ-barrel structures is S=n/2,
i.e. arranged in a near parallel fashion with respect to the ﬂ-barrel
lumen. We further demonstrate that ﬂ-barrels with <24 ﬁ-strands
are unable to readily access such architecture as a consequence of
luminal side-Chain packing constraints.

2 METHODS

2.1 ,B-Barrel parameter reﬁnement

To build atomic models of ﬁ-barrels. an initial C01 template geometry was
generated based on known ﬁ-barrel structures (McLachlan. 1979; Murzin
at (11.. 1994a). For a given pair of n and S . idealized cylindrical ﬁ-barrels
were built with a radius R and a ﬁ-strand slope of 01 with respect to the
cylinder axis. following McLachlan (1979) and in a fashion reminiscent of
research by Sansom and Kerr (1995). Each residue is represented by its
C01 and placed on the surface of the cylinder. Positions of the C01 are fully
determined by the values of n and S and by the choice of the grid parameters
a and b (Murzin at (11.. 1994a). a is the C017ch distance between adjacent
residues on the same ﬁ-strand (intra-strand). while I) is the C014301 distance
across hydrogen-bonded ﬁ-strands (inter-strand).

When building such ﬁ-barrels. the values of the parameters a and b
inﬂuence the local (e.g. intra- and inter-strand distances) as well as global
(e.g. radius) structural features of the resulting models. In this study.
we optimized the a and 1) parameters using a training set of antiparallel
membrane-embedded ﬁ-barrels that are formed by homo-oligomers. We
searched protein structure databases using the MPtopo and PDBe tools
(Jayasinghe at (11.. 2001; Velankar at (11.. 2011) and found eight suitable
structures following these strict criteria. Of these eight chosen structures
(Supplementary Table S1). the transmembrane ﬁ-barrels were isolated and
their C01 coordinates projected on the surface of a ﬁtted cylinder (based on
least-square ﬁtting) and the grid parameters were derived. All structures
showed a clear cylindrical and symmetric shape and our analysis found
that a=3.48A and 1124.83 A. The latter values are found to be in very
good agreement with previously reported ones for antiparallel water-soluble
ﬁ-barrels ((123.53 A; 1124.87 A) (Chou and Scheraga. 1982). The ratio
a/b=0.721 is also in excellent agreement with the 0.719 reported for a
non-overlapping set of transmembrane ﬁ-barrels (Pali and Marsh. 2001).

Using these reﬁned parameters. the ﬁ-barrel C01 scaffold was built: ﬁrst
the C01 (jg-strand 1) is placed at a distance R to the arbitrary cylinder axis.
The C01 of the next residue is then positioned at a distance a on the cylinder
surface such that the angle between the C017ch vector and the ﬁ-barrel axis
is 01. The remaining residues of the ﬁ-strand are iteratively positioned the
same way. The ﬁrst C01 of the adjacent ﬁ-strand (strand 2) is positioned on the
cylinder surface. at a distance I) from an adjacent C01 belonging to ﬁ-strand 1
in such a way that the C014301 vector is perpendicular to ﬁ-strand 1. The other
residues of ﬁ-strand 2 are placed as was done for ﬁ-strand 1. The remaining
ﬁ-strands are built iteratively using the same method.

2.2 Atomistic ,B-barrel models

Based on the C01 scaffold. full atomistic models were ﬁrst built as poly-
alanine ﬁ-strands. The Cﬁ atoms were positioned 1.5 A apart from the C01
alternately facing towards the pore lumen and towards the membrane. thus
ensuring proper orientation of the side chains and the antiparallel nature
of the ﬁ-bairels. Amino acid sequences of the ﬁ-hairpins and ﬁ-turns were
subsequently mapped onto this framework using MODELLER (Eswar at (11..
2006). The resulting structures were subjected to three cycles of energy
minimization employing NAMD 2.8 (Phillips 21111.. 2005). the CHARMM22
forceﬁeld with CMAP correction (MacKerell at (11.. 1998; Mackerell at (11..
2004) and the GBIS solvent model (Tanner at (11.. 2011). In the ﬁrst step.
harmonic restraints on heavy atoms are smoothly relaxed from 200 to
5 kJ (mol A)‘1 to resolve potential steric clashes. In the second step. inter-
strand backbone hydrogen bonds constraints are employed (NiH...O=C)
with a reference value of 1.9 A (McLachlan. 1979) and relaxed from 5 to
1 kJ (mol A)‘ 1. The hydrogen bonds correspond to the canonical antiparallel
ﬁ-strand hydrogen bonding pattern. In the ﬁnal step. all constraints are
relaxed. Energy minimizations involved 15 000 steps in total.

Based on the values of n and S in our dataset. the corresponding ﬁ-barrels
atomic models were built and found to reproduce closely the crystallographic
structure with an average C01 RMSD ~1.1 A (Supplementary Table S1).
thus validating our approach and methodology. Model pore radii were

found to be in excellent agreement with radii calculated from the X-ray
structures.

Transmembrane ﬁ-barrel models were subsequently built for pneumolysin
(38 subunits; n = 152) (Tilley at (11.. 2005). Five models were built with shear
values S = 0. 11/2. 11. 311/2 and 2n. In addition. the estimate of error ofﬁ-bairel
diameter estimation is calculated (see Supplementary Materail).

2.3 Side-chain packing in the ,B-barrel interior

To probe the inﬂuence of side-chain packing on ﬁ-barrel architecture (e.g.
the choice of S given n). we positioned pseudo-side chains in the ﬁ-bairel
interior of our C01 scaffold and calculated the van der Waals (VdW) interaction
energy (Evdw) of one pseudo-side chain with its closest eight neighbours
(Supplementary Fig. S2). To achieve this. a pseudo-methyl group per residue
was positioned in the ﬁ-barrel interior 3.0 A away from the C01. thus
mimicking an amino acid side chain with an aliphatic group at position
Cy. As a result. a methyl group is placed in the interior every second
residue (i.e. following the alternate orientation of side chains in ﬁ-strands).
The resulting semi-quantitative Evdw calculated for each combination of
(n. S) are presented in Figure 2 and compared with known structures
(Supplementary Table S2). Methyl group VdW parameters were taken from
the GROMOS forceﬁeld (Oostenbrink at (11.. 2004).

3 RESULTS
3.1 Predicting shear values of CDC ,B-barrels

The 28 A resolution cryo-EM structure of pneumolysin contains
152 ﬂ-strands and forms a pore 240 A in diameter [PLY; EMDB ID:
EMD-1107 (Tilley e1 (11., 2005)]. We compared a range of models
and identiﬁed the ﬂ-barrel with a shear value that most Closely
agreed with these experimental data. Homo-oligomeric antiparallel
ﬂ-barrels typically have an S -value that is an integer multiple of the
number of ﬂ-strands, therefore, S :11 and S =2n models were built
together with the S :0 model. Moreover, since two hairpins (i.e.
four ﬂ-strands) are contributed per monomer, it is possible for CDC
ﬂ-barrels to have shear values of S = 11/2 or S = 311/2 (Supplementary
Fig. 51).

The model that ﬁtted best within the experimental EM data, based
upon predicted radius, possessed a shear value of S =n/2 (Fig. 1,
Supplementary Table S3). Furthermore, our analysis suggests that
a ﬂ-barrel with S =n/2 would also permit a right-handed twist of
the ﬂ-strands that is Characteristic of ﬂ-barrels formed by L-amino
acids.

Given the 28 A resolution of the EM data, however, the model
with S = 0 may be possible. Neither the S :0 nor the S =n/2 model
can be favoured in terms of the overall height of the ﬂ-barrels with
respect to the position of the CDC globular head domain since there
is only a 7 A reduction in height between the S = 0 and the S =n/2
models (over a total distance of 88 A). In both models, the globular
head domains can ﬁt well within the density (Fig. 1B).

In contrast, S-values of n, 311/2 or 2n resulted in pore sizes that
are far larger than the observed dimensions of the pore (Fig. l).
Importantly, the calculated minimum diameter for the S :11 model
and the calculated maximum diameter for the S =n/2 model do not
overlap (Supplementary Table S3). The minimum diameter for the
S = 11 model does not overlap with the EM density of the ﬂ-barrel. We
were, therefore, conﬁdent in ruling out the S = 11 model for this CDC.

Perfringolysin O (PFO), while it has no 3D EM data of the pore,
has contributed to our understanding of the mechanism of CDC pore
formation (Rossjohn e1 (11., 1997; Shatursky e1 (11., 1999; Shepard
et (11., 1998). Importantly, pyrene labelling studies of adjacent side

chains in PFO suggest that the ﬂ-strands are slightly staggered and,
therefore, favour the slightly tilted S =n/2 model over the parallel
S :0 model (Ramachandran e1 (11., 2004; Supplementary Fig. S3).

3.2 Constraints governing ,B-barrel size and shape

For small ﬂ-barrels (n < 24) the shear value lies within the n 5 S 5 2n
range (Murzin e1 (11., 1994b; Nagano e1 (11., 1999; Schulz, 2002).
We, therefore, investigated whether there were any constraints that
limited the S-value for a given number of ﬂ-strands.

A major constraint for small ﬂ-barrel architecture is the packing
of the side chains in the interior of the ﬂ-barrel (Lesk e1 (11.,
1989; Murzin e1 (11., 1994a). Typically, ﬂ-sheets in water-soluble
ﬂ-barrels bury hydrophobic residues in the interior. In contrast,
in membrane-embedded pores, the interior channel is lined with
hydrophilic residues, whereas the exterior surface of the ﬂ-barrel
is hydrophobic. The packing of the side chains in the lumen of the
ﬂ-barrel plays an important role in the overall architecture of the
ﬂ-barrel.

Fig. 2. Interior side-chain packing as a function of ﬁ-barrel architecture.
In (A) and (B), the interior side-chain packing is semi-quantitatively
estimated by side-chain van der Waals energies (in k] mol‘1). White regions
(Evdw > 1.0kJ mol‘1) are considered unfavourable, grey regions (Evdw <
1.0kJ mol‘1) are considered favourable. Squares represent water-soluble
ﬁ-barrels, diamonds represent membrane ﬁ-barrels and circles represent
oligomeric antiparallel membrane ﬁ-barrels.

We calculated the theoretical side-chain van der Waals energies
for all theoretical combinations of S and n in antiparallel ﬂ-barrels
(Fig. 2). It can be predicted from the plot that it is not energetically
favourable for small antiparallel ﬂ-barrels to achieve 0 5S 5n
structural arrangement due to steric clashes made by the lumen-
orientated side chains. However, side-chain packing no longer
becomes a constraint for ﬂ-barrel architecture in ﬂ-barrels >20
ﬂ-strands. Therefore, giant ﬂ-barrels formed by CDCs are capable
of forming ‘near parallel’ barrels, whereas small ﬂ-barrels are not.

3.3 Validation of the side-chain constraints for small
soluble ,B-barrels

To validate the side-chain packing plot (Fig. 2), we analysed the
range in known structures of both soluble ﬂ-barrels and membrane-
embedded ﬂ-barrel solved to date. Most structures lie within the
energetically favourable region of the plot (Fig. 2B, Supplementary
Table S2). In addition, the structures in general lie within the n5
S 52n (Murzin e1 (11., 1994b; Nagano e1 (11., 1999; Schulz, 2002)
region.

There are two known exceptions to this rule: the ﬁrst is
oxidoreductase (PDB ID 3sod), which has eight ﬂ-strands and a
shear value of 6 (n = 8, S = 6) and thus lying within the energetically
unfavourable region. However, oxidoreductase has only a single
hydrogen bond between two of the ﬂ-strands due to the constraints

of the ﬂ-sheet and the stacking of side chains within the ﬂ-barrel
and thus resembles a ‘burst’ or overstuffed 13 -barrel (Supplementary
Fig. S4). The second 13 -barrel type lies in the unfavourable region is
tetrahydrodipicolinate N-succinyltransferase (n = 6, S = 6) (PDB ID
ltdt). This is a very short ﬂ-barrel that contains only a single side
chain per ﬂ-strand stacked inside the ﬂ-barrel lumen (Supplementary
Fig. S5). Lumen-directed side chains in this structure can, therefore,
readily access space at the top and the bottom of the ﬂ-barrel.

Together, these exceptions support the idea that steric clashes
in the interior of ﬂ-barrels affect the possible combinations of
shear (S) and ﬂ-strand number (n) in small antiparallel ‘near-ideal’
ﬂ-barrels that contain extensive ﬂ-sheet hydrogen bonds between
all ﬂ-strands.

It is also important to note that our calculations suggest that the
constraints imposed by side chains on the S to n ratio disappear
as ﬂ-barrel sizes grow over 20 ﬂ-strands. For giant ﬂ-barrels such
as CDC pore forming proteins, it is predicted that there are no
limitations to the S / n ratio imposed by luminal side-chain packing.
In summary, our data show that, as 13 -barre1s grow larger, the interior
lumen becomes less curved and more amenable to a smaller shear
to number of ﬂ-strands ratio.

4 DISCUSSION

Comparison of ﬂ-barrel models with published 3D-EM structures
(Tilley e1 (11., 2005), reveals that for CDCs, a ﬂ-barrel formed with
a shear value of S =n/2 provides the best ﬁt. This is supported by
the biophysical research performed upon PFO (Rarnachandran e1
(11., 2004). We further found that giant ﬂ-barrels have no apparent
limitation with respect to shear values. In contrast, the architecture
of smaller ﬂ-barrels is severely constrained by lumen side-chain
packing. To the best of our knowledge, ﬂ-barrels that are long
enough to span a membrane and possess a shear value of S =n/2
or 0 have not been observed at atomic resolution. However, our data
lend support to the idea that CDCs can indeed form such structures.
These ideas may be of further utility in modelling large ﬂ-barrels
formed by other supermolecular complexes.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Accurately predicting protein secondary structure and
relative solvent accessibility is important for the study of protein evo-
lution, structure and function and as a component of protein 3D struc-
ture prediction pipelines. Most predictors use a combination of
machine learning and profiles, and thus must be retrained and as-
sessed periodically as the number of available protein sequences
and structures continues to grow.

Results: We present newly trained modular versions of the SSpro and
ACCpro predictors of secondary structure and relative solvent acces-
sibility together with their multi-class variants SSpr08 and ACCpr020.
We introduce a sharp distinction between the use of sequence simi-
larity alone, typically in the form of sequence profiles at the input level,
and the additional use of sequence-based structural similarity, which
uses similarity to sequences in the Protein Data Bank to infer annota-
tions at the output level, and study their relative contributions to
modern predictors. Using sequence similarity alone, SSpro’s accuracy
is between 79 and 80% (79% for ACCpro) and no other predictor
seems to exceed 82%. However, when sequence-based structural
similarity is added, the accuracy of SSpro rises to 92.9% (90% for
ACCpro). Thus, by combining both approaches, these problems
appear now to be essentially solved, as an accuracy of 100%
cannot be expected for several well-known reasons. These results
point also to several open technical challenges, including (i) achieving
on the order of 380% accuracy, without using any similarity with
known proteins and (ii) achieving on the order of 385% accuracy,
using sequence similarity alone.

Availability and implementation: SSpro, SSpr08, ACCpro and
ACCpr020 programs, data and web servers are available through

1 INTRODUCTION

The prediction of protein structural features, such as secondary
structure and relative solvent accessibility, are useful for the
study of protein evolution, structure and function and as modu-
lar components of protein 3D structure prediction pipelines.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Most of the best predictors use a combination of machine learn-
ing and evolutionary information, in the form of multiple align-
ment profiles, and thus must be retrained and assessed
periodically as the available protein data continues to grow.
Here we present the results obtained by modifying and retraining
SSpro and ACCpro (Cheng et al., 2005; Pollastri et al., 2001,
2002), two widely used predictors of secondary structure and
relative solvent accessibility, respectively, and broadly assessing
prediction performance in these fields.

It has been known for two decades that evolutionary informa-
tion in the form of proﬁles calculated on similar sequences helps
predictors. In the case of secondary structure prediction, for in-
stance, performance accuracy improves by roughly 2 percentage
points when proﬁles are used in the input, as opposed to raw
sequences alone. It is also known that using proﬁles in the
output, by predicting the secondary structure of each sequence
in an alignment and taking the ‘majority’ of each column, leads
to a smaller improvement (<l%) over using the raw sequences
alone. Furthermore, using proﬁles in both the input and the
output usually leads to no signiﬁcant improvement over using
proﬁles in the input alone.

Machine leaming—based predictors developed during the past
two decades have been almost exclusively focused and evaluated
on their ability to predict the secondary structure or relative
solvent accessibility from the sequence or the proﬁle alone. The
past decade of work has not produced major prediction improve-
ments, resulting in a set of competing predictors with similar
methods, training datasets, protocols and, most importantly,
similar prediction performancesifor instance, roughly around
80% for secondary structure prediction. This is despite the
number of experimentally solved structure deposited in the
Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Berman et al., 2000), which has sig-
niﬁcantly increased over the same period (Fig. l) and continues
to increase faster each year (Fig. 2).

However, besides using sequence similarity to create input pro-
files, there is potentially a second way of using sequence similar-
ity to leverage the growth of the PDB and improve predictions.
Namely, if a portion of a query sequence is similar to a sequence
in the PDB, it may be possible to use the annotation of the PDB
sequence to annotate the query sequence, in lieu or in combin-
ation with the prediction produced by the machine learning
methods. This is what we call sequence-based structural similar-
ity. Although the correlation between sequence similarity and
structure similarity is not perfect (Kosloff and Kolodny, 2008),

it is well known that two domains with similar sequences will in
general have similar structures (Kaczanowski and Zielenkiewicz,
2010).

There are good reasons to suspect that sequence-based struc-
tural similarity may be effective. A simple analysis of the PDB
entries released between 1996 and 2013 (Figs 3 and 4) reveals that
as of today, only 6% of the amino acids deposited in the PDB
each month belong to protein regions with no similarity to se-
quences previously deposited in the PDB (Fig. 3). Furthermore,
this percentage is decreasing year after year. Finally, when we
examine the large, redundancy reduced and representative set of
all proteins UNIREFSO (Suzek et al., 2007), we find that 62% of
its sequences have at least one domain with a similarity of 330%
to a sequence in the PDB.

Thus, in short, the main purposes of this article, besides
the upgrade of existing predictors, is to study in detail the effect-
iveness of sequence-based structural similarity for secondary
structure and relative solvent accessibility prediction alone, and
how it can be combined with predictions derived by machine
learning methods with profiles to improve the overall state-
of—the-art.

2 METHODS

2.1 Training datasets

Three datasets are curated to train and evaluate the four predictors
(SSpro, ACCpro, SSpr08 and ACCpr020). The ﬁrst dataset (pdb_full)
is derived from the PDB structures released before August 20, 2013.
Protein structures solved by X-ray crystallography with a resolution of
at least 2.5 angstroms, with no chain breaks, with less than ﬁve unknown
amino acids and of length at least 30 are ﬁrst extracted from the database.
Redundancy of the selected protein chains is first reduced at the 25%
sequence identity level using CD-HIT (Li and Godzik, 2006) and
Blastclust (Altschul et al., 1997), and then further reduced using an
HSSP cutoff distance of 5 using UniqueProt (Mika and Rest, 2003) re-
sulting in 5772 protein chains. The second dataset (pdb_ante) is derived
from the PDB entries released before May 1, 2012 following the same
protocol than pdb_full and contains 5310 protein chains. The third data-
set (pdb_post) contains the 11213 protein chains passing the ﬁltering
criteria described above deposited in the PDB after May 1, 2012 and
before August 20, 2013. Redundancy in this last dataset is not reduced
because its purpose is precisely to allow a realistic assessment of post-
performance given pre-training data.

The secondary structure and solvent accessibility values assigned by
DSSP (Kabsch and Sander, 1983) to each amino acid in these datasets are
used to determine the target classes for the four predictors: secondary
structure in 3 and 8 classes, and relative solvent accessibility for 20 dif-
ferent thresholds from 0 to 95% in 5% increments.

2.2 Three-stage prediction

The four predictors share the same three-stage prediction workﬂow de-
picted in Figure 5. The ﬁrst step is similar to other predictors and consists
in using three iterated steps of PSI-BLAST with the UNIREF50 database
(Suzek et al., 2007) to derive multiple sequence alignment and proﬁle
probabilities. The second step is similar to previous versions of SSpro
or ACCpro, and uses an ensemble of 100 Bidirectional Recursive Neural
Networks (BRNNs) trained on the data to generate a ﬁrst set of prob-
ability predictions for each secondary structure or solvent accessibility
class. Any other machine learning approach can be substituted in this
step. The third stage replaces the previous predictions with predictions
derived using sequence-based structural similarity in regions where simi-
lar sequences can be found in the PDB. Similar sequences extracted using
BLAST are ﬁltered such that at least 10 amino acids are aligned to the
target protein without any gap (30 amino acids for relative solvent acces-
sibility), the BLAST expectation value is <10’9 and the aligned regions
must have at least 45% identical amino acids and 55% positive substitu-
tions (70 and 75%, respectively, for relative solvent accessibility predic-
tions). The most frequent DSSP-assigned class in the set of proteins
selected for a given position in the target protein is selected as the ﬁnal
prediction for that position. The BRNN predictions from the second
stage are used for all positions that do not have similar regions in the
PDB, as well as those with similar sequences in the PDB but no dominant
DSSP class.

2.3 Evaluation procedure

The four predictors are evaluated following two distinct protocols.

The ﬁrst protocol (P1) aims to estimate the accuracy of the ﬁnal pre-
dictors made available online. A double 10-fold cross validation is per-
formed on pdb_full where the data is ﬁrst randomly divided into 10 folds.
For each cross validation fold, the remaining 90% of the data is further
subdivided into 10 sub-folds, and 10 BRNN models are trained, respect-
ively, on each set of nine sub-folds. The 10 models are tested together on
the remaining 10% of the data. The resulting ensemble of 100 BRNN
models is used to produce the ﬁnal predictor. Predictions using sequence-
based structural similarity are added to the BRNN predictions after each
step of the cross validation. To provide a complete but fair evaluation of
the sequence-based structural similarity predictions, protein chains iden-
tical to any protein sequence in pdb_full are removed from the PDB for

this evaluation. However, sequences that are similar but not identical to
sequences in pdb_full are not removed, regardless of their similarity level,
precisely to evaluate the prediction accuracy as a function of sequence
similarity.

The second protocol (P2) aims to estimate how the method performs
over time by training the BRNN models following protocol P1 but using
the smaller set of PDB entries released before May 1, 2012 (dataset
pdb_ante), and testing the resulting predictor on all the protein entries
released after May 1, 2012 (dataset pdb_post). Sequence-based structural
similarity predictions in this case use all the PDB entries released before
May 1, 2012, thus enabling the assessment of the performance of the
combined predictor over a 16 month period without retraining.

2.4 Comparison with other predictors

Fair comparisons with existing predictors are difﬁcult for several reasons.
First, the various predictors are trained on different datasets, at different
times, using different versions of the PDB. Often, the datasets are not
available and, even when they are, the details of the cross validation
datasets are not preventing a perfect comparison requiring training and
testing on the same folds. Second, retraining third-party predictors using
our own data is also not feasible because the trainable version of these
predictors is not publicly available. Furthermore, retraining third-party
software is subject to criticism owing to the variability resulting from the
ﬁne-tuning of hyperparameters and related matters. Third, even the most
popular predictors still actively updated, like DISTILL (Mirabello and
Pollastri, 2013) or PSIPRED (Buchan et al., 2013), do not come with a
sequence-based structural similarity module.

Nevertheless, we provide some measure of comparison by reporting
the accuracy numbers for DISTILL and PSIPRED, using the most recent
version of these programs kindly made available to us by the authors. We
compute these accuracy numbers on the same datasets used to evaluate
SSpro and ACCpro, giving the other predictors the beneﬁt of the doubt,
as some of the proteins in our test sets are likely to be in the training sets
of the other predictors. Because both DISTILL and PSIPRED use proﬁle
inputs and are currently provided without corresponding sequence proﬁle
generators, we used our own generator PROFILpro to generate all the
necessary sequence proﬁles. Note that PROFILpro is available for down-
load, together with all our other predictors.

Note: Accuracy reported for the pdb_full and pdb_ante datasets is obtained follow—
ing protocol P1, and accuracy reported for the pdb_post dataset is obtained follow—
ing protocol P2. Accuracy reported for ACCpr020 is the accuracy at the 25%
accessibility threshold. Accuracy of the newly trained versions of 33pm and
ACCpro are reported in bold font. Previous published accuracy of the predictors
is also reported (Cheng et (1]., 2005). Accuracy of DISTILL (Mirabello and Pollastri,
2013) and PSIPRED (Buchan et (1]., 2013) are reported for the same datasets using
the downloadable packages made available by the authors (see Section 2.4).

following the P1 protocol, whereas the accuracy of the predictors
on the pdb_post dataset is obtained following the P2 protocol.

Using both sequence similarity and sequence-based structural
similarity, SSpro’s accuracy is 92.91% on pdb_full and 91.74%
when trained on pdb_ante (PDB entries released before May 1,
2012) and evaluated on the 11213 recent PDB entries in
pdb_post (released after May 1, 2012). This is considerably
better than any other existing predictor, including the previous
release of SSpro (Table 1). This result, combined with the initial
analysis performed on the PDB and UNIREFSO databases (see
Section 1), highlights the interest of systematically combining
sequence-based structural similarity with proﬁle-based machine
learning methods. Without using sequence-based structural simi-
larity, the accuracy of the best secondary structure predictors
(including SSpro) is estimated to be between 79 and 82%
(Mirabello and Pollastri, 2013), thus 10% lower than the accur-
acy of SSpro after combining the raw predictions with the ones
based on known protein structures. It is useful to contrast the
combination of both approaches with the use of sequence-based
structural similarity alone. For instance, using sequence-based
structural similarity alone, predictions can be made for 75% of
the amino acids in the dataset pdb_post, with an overall accuracy
of 96%.

SSpro’s accuracy as a function of sequence similarity and iden-
tity is reported in Figure 6, showing that as soon as similar se-
quences can be found in the PDB, even with low sequence
identity or similarity with the target protein, the prediction ac-
curacy signiﬁcantly increases. SSpro is also the only secondary
structure predictor made publicly available for download, which
includes both proﬁle generation and sequence-based structural
similarity modules.

Similarly, at the 25% accessibility threshold, ACCpro accur-
acy is 90.02% on pdb_full and 88.22% on pdb_post, above any
other predictor, and about 8% better than the accuracy of the

similarity, are included in the 0% sequence identity or similarity case

previous ACCpro release. A similar detailed evaluation of the
predictor’s accuracy, as a function of sequence identity and simi-
larity, is provided in Figure 7.

Results for SSpro and ACCpro multi-class variants SSpr08
and ACCpr020 also show signiﬁcant improvements. SSpr08 is
the eight-class version of SSpro, predicting the protein secondary
structure using the eight different classes assigned by DSSP. The
sequence-based structural similarity analysis is available for the
ﬁrst time for this kind of predictor and results in an accuracy of
87.92% on pdb_full and 85.88% on pdb_post, a 22% improve-
ment over the last published accuracy of the SSpr08 predictor.
ACCpr020 is the 20-class version of ACCpro predicting if an
amino acid is buried or exposed for 20 different relative solvent
accessibility thresholds. ACCpr020 prediction accuracy is
89.92% in the hard case (25% accessibility threshold) and is
now comparable with the accuracy of ACCpro. Note that both
predictors have no other existing method to be directly compared
with.

Finally, redundancy in the SSpro and ACCpro training sets
was reduced using ﬁrst a 25% sequence identity threshold. This
is a common practice in the ﬁeld, established over the years
through many trial and errors and aimed at balancing multiple
constraints: in particular redundancy reduction versus training
set size. However, there is nothing fundamental about such a
threshold, and one might be concerned by the existence of pro-
teins in the training and test sets that are remotely homologous,
with a level of sequence identity <25%, which could lead to
overestimating the accuracy of the predictors. To address this
point, ﬁrst note that we used a more stringent redundancy re-
duction procedure than a simple 25% identity cutoff by using an
additional HSSP distance cutoff (see Section 2). Second, we con-
ducted one additional set of tests. For each test protein in
pdb_full, we used PSI-BLAST to extract any segment of length
at least 10 with sequence identity of at least 18% with any other
protein in the training set. In total, 58% of amino acids in the
test set were found to occur in such segments, leaving 42% of

tural similarity, are included in the 0% sequence identity or similarity case

amino acids in the test set with no similarity to the training set
(at the 18% identity level). The accuracy of SSpro on both
groups of amino acids is almost identical: 92.98% on the first
group (58% of all amino acids) and 92.81% on the second,
highly non-redundant, group (42% of all amino acids), with a
combined accuracy of 92.91% as reported above. Interestingly,
using a much higher and more permissive identity threshold of
50% over at least 10 amino acids, the predictor’s accuracy is
92.61% on the redundant group (7% of all amino acids) and
92.93% on the least redundant group (93% of all amino acids).
Similar results are observed for ACCpro. Thus, these results
show that the small residual redundancy between the training
and test sets does not lead to overestimating the performance
of the predictors. Within reasonable ranges, this accuracy is
roughly constant regardless of the residual level of similarity,
providing additional confirmation of the validity of the training
protocol used here.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

SSpro and ACCpro achieve a performance accuracy above 92
and 90%, respectively, when presented with samples of proteins
either in the PDB (pdb_full) or in the process of being added to
the PDB (pdb_post). Barring surprises from proteins that yet
remain to be discovered, one may conjecture that the problems
of protein secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility
prediction are close to being solved.

It is well known that there are fundamental reasons why an
accuracy of 100% should not be expected, including (i) the pres-
ence of disordered regions; (ii) the ambiguities inherent in the
deﬁnitions of secondary structure or relative solvent accessibility,
as reﬂected by the imperfect correlation between several pro-
grams for determining these features from PDB files; (iii) the
errors and uncertainties contained in the PDB; and (iv) the
role of the solvent and other molecules, from ions to chaperone

proteins, in determining structure, and which are not taken into
consideration by most present methods.

As the PDB continues to grow, so will the coverage provided
by sequence-based structural similarity methods. Systematically
combining proﬁles, machine learning methods and sequence-
based structural similarity seems to be the best strategy, and
this is one of the reasons we are providing separate modules
for each one of these three tasks. Because protein structures
are more conserved than protein sequences, in the future further
small improvements may be possible by using methods capable
of detecting remote structural similarity, not readily Visible in the
sequences alone. However, the best existing such methods use
predicted secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility to
detect remote homology. To avoid any circularity, in the present
study we have striven to separate the detection of structural simi-
larity from the prediction of secondary structure.

Finally, when proteins fold in vivo or even in vitro, they do not
use sequence or structural similarity at all. This suggests that our
understanding of protein structural features is far from complete
and points to at least two interesting technical challenges for the
foreseeable future: (i) predicting structural features with an ac-
curacy of about 380%, using no similarity to known proteins at
all, i.e. no proﬁles; (ii) predicting structural features with an ac-
curacy of 385%, using sequence similarity alone and no struc-
tural similarity. We believe that the key to addressing these
challenges is to use machine learning methods that can use in-
formation contained in larger input windows, ideally the entire
protein lengths. Recent progress in deep learning methods,
including the use of new training approaches such as the dropout
algorithm (Baldi and Sadowski, 2014) and GPU clusters, may
offer some promising directions.

4.1 Software availability

The four predictors are included in the SCRATCH suite of pre-
dictors available online at http://scratch.proteomics.ics.uci.edu
together with all the data. A stand-alone version of the predictors
can be downloaded from the same url and is free for academic
use. PROFILpro, the sequence profile generator used by the four
predictors, and HOMOLpro, the sequence-based structural simi-
larity secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility pre-
dictor, are also made available as stand-alone tools. They can be
used in combination with other secondary structure or solvent
accessibility predictors.

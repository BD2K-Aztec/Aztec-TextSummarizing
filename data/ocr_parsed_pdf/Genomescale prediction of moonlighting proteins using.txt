Abstract

Motivation: Moonlighting proteins (MPs) show multiple cellular functions within a single polypeptide
chain. To understand the overall landscape of their functional diversity, it is important to establish a
computational method that can identify MPs on a genome scale. Previously, we have systematically
characterized MPs using functional and omics—scale information. In this work, we develop a computa—
tional prediction model for automatic identification of MPs using a diverse range of protein associ—
ation information.

Results: We incorporated a diverse range of protein association information to extract characteris—
tic features of MPs, which range from gene ontology (GO), protein—protein interactions, gene ex—
pression, phylogenetic profiles, genetic interactions and network—based graph properties to protein
structural properties, i.e. intrinsically disordered regions in the protein chain. Then, we used ma—
chine learning classifiers using the broad feature space for predicting MPs. Because many known
MPs lack some proteomic features, we developed an imputation technique to fill such missing fea—
tures. Results on the control dataset show that MPs can be predicted with over 98% accuracy when
GO terms are available. Furthermore, using only the omics—based features the method can still
identify MPs with over 75% accuracy. Last, we applied the method on three genomes:
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans and Homo sapiens, and found that about
2—10% of proteins in the genomes are potential MPs.

As the last decade has witnessed a momentous expansion in the num—
ber of functionally well—characterized proteins as well as rapid pro—
gress in large—scale proteomics studies, protein multi—functionality has
become a highly perceived phenomenon (Campbell and Scanes, 1995;
Jeffery, 1999; Weaver, 1998). These multifunctional, ‘moonlighting’
proteins demonstrate multiple autonomous and usually unrelated
functions within a single polypeptide chain, which cannot be individu—
ally assigned into separate domains. It has become evident that the

certain protein families nor facilitated by common function—switching
mechanisms. Many of the known moonlighting proteins (MPs) were
originally recognized as enzymes, but there are also others that are
known as receptors, channel proteins, chaperone proteins, ribosomal
proteins or scaffold proteins (Jeffery, 1999, 2004). There are specula—
tions that MPs evolved to broaden the functional aspects of a genome
without expanding the genome size (Jeffery, 1999). Studies suggest
significant impacts of MPs in diseases and disorders (Ovadi, 2011;

Sriram et (11., 2005) as well as roles in important biochemical path—
ways (Jeffery, 2004). Despite the potential abundance of MPs in vari—
ous genomes and their important roles in pathways and disease
developments, the size of existing databases (Hernandez et (11., 2014;
Mani et (11., 2014) that contain experimentally confirmed MP5 is still
too small to obtain a comprehensive picture of the cellular mechan—
isms underlying their functional diversity. This quantitative insuffi—
ciency is due in large part to the tendency for the additional function
of these proteins to be found serendipitously in the course of unrelated
experiments. Hence, a systematic bioinformatics approach could
make substantial contributions in identifying novel MP5 on a genome
scale and also to an overall understanding of the underlying biology
of their multi—functional nature.

The functional diversity of MPs poses a significant challenge to
computational protein function annotation as current methods do
not explicitly consider the possibility of dual functions for a protein.
Conventional sequence—based functional annotation methods, based
on the concept of homology (Altschul et (11., 1997) or conserved
motifs/domains (Bru et (11., 2005; Firm et (11., 2014; Hunter et (11.,
2012), will have problems identifying secondary functions because
there are cases where a homolog of a MP does not possess the sec—
ondary function (Ozimek et (11., 2006) or has a different secondary
function (Banerjee et (11., 2007; Chen et (11., 2005). Due to these in—
trinsic computational challenges, systematic studies of MPs are still
in an early stage for obtaining a comprehensive picture of proteins’
moonlighting functions or for developing computational methods
for predicting MPs [review by (Khan and Kihara, 2014)]. Existing
bioinformatics approaches for detection of MPs have two general
shortcomings. First, they rely heavily on the existence of functional
annotation of a protein (Chapple et (11., 2015; Pritykin et (11., 2015),
which is a major bottleneck of the problem. Second, all the existing
methods address different aspects of MPs’ functional diversity: se—
quence similarity (Gomez et (11., 2003; Khan et (11., 2012), motifs/
domains, structural disorder (Hernandez et (11., 2011), or protein—
protein interaction (PPI) patterns combined with existing gene
ontology (GO) annotations (Chapple et (11., 2015; Gomez et (11.,
2011; Pritykin et (11., 2015). However, the diverse nature of MPs’
functions, cellular locations, function switching mechanisms, and
the organisms in which they are found gives compelling evidence
that in order to understand and identify the overall functional as—
pects of these proteins, one should characterize these proteins in a
wider functional/proteomic space.

Previously, we have identified functional characteristics of MPs
in different proteomic aspects using a computational framework
(Khan et (11., 2014). Here, we have constructed an automated predic—
tion model to identify MPs based on features we characterized in
our previous study. To address the diverse nature of MPs, we have
used a wide feature space ranging from GO (Gene Ontology
Consortium, 2013) and several omics—scale data, namely PPI, gene
expression (GE), phylogenetic profiles (Phylo), genetic interactions
(GIs) and network—based graph properties (such as node between—
ness, degree centrality, closeness—centrality), to protein structural
properties such as the number and the length of intrinsically dis—
ordered regions in the protein chain. Based on our computed GO
and the omics—based protein feature space, we used machine learn—
ing classifiers as the framework for MP prediction and used an exist—
ing MP database to cross—validate our prediction model. Because a
significant fraction of proteins do not have certain functional/net—
work features in databases, we have additionally developed an im—
putation technique using random forest (RF) to predict missing
features for proteins. Cross—validation results on the dataset of
known moonlighting and non—MPs (control dataset) show that if

GO information is available, MPs can be predicted with over 98%
accuracy. More importantly, leveraging just the non—GO based fea—
tures, our imputation—classification models can predict MP5 with
over 75 % accuracy. The latter result is very important because it in—
dicates that MPs without sufficient function annotations can be
identified by analyzing available omics data, which is the first such
development. Lastly, we have run our imputation—classification
models with the best performing omics—based feature combinations
on three genomes, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), Caenorhabditis
elegans and Homo sapiens (human), and found that about 2—10%
of the proteomes are potential MP5.

2 Methods

The overall computational prediction model, named MPFit
(Moonlighting protein Prediction with missing Feature Imputation)
undergoes four phases: data construction, feature computation,
missing feature imputation (when needed) and classification into
MP or non—MP. Each of the steps is discussed in detail below.

2.1 Data construction

We used a manually curated MP database, MoonProt (Mani et (11.,
2014), and extracted 268 proteins that had Uniprot ID mapping.
Two hundred sixty—eight MPs include those from human (45 pro—
teins, 16.8%), Escherichia coli (30 proteins, 11.19%), yeast (27 pro—
teins, 10.1%) and mouse (11 proteins, 4.1%). In order for our
model to train on negative examples of such proteins along with the
positive examples, we used the following criteria to select negative
examples of MPs (referred as non—MPs) from these four genomes as
developed in our previous work (Khan et (11., 2014). A protein was
selected as a non—MP if it has (i) at least eight GO term annotations,
(ii) when GO terms in the Biological Process (BP) category were
clustered using the semantic similarity score (Schlicker et (11., 2006)
thresholds of 0.1 and 0.5, not more than one cluster was obtained at
each threshold. We further added a criterion on Molecular Function
(MF) category GO terms: (iii) not more than one cluster of MF GO
terms at semantic similarity scores of 0.1 and 0.5. In essence, a non—
MP is a protein that has a sufficient number of GO annotations but
they are not functionally diverse. For this procedure, full GO anno—
tations (including computationally predicted terms such as IEA)
were taken from UniProt and parental propagation of GO terms
was not applied, to be consistent with the criteria established in our
previous work (Khan et (11., 2014). Furthermore, we computed pair—
wise sequence similarity of the selected non—MPs from the above
three conditions and further ruled out redundant proteins that had
>25% sequence identity to other sequences. This process yielded
162 non—MPs, among which 60 are from human (37.0%), 52 from
mouse (32.1%), 34 from yeast (20.9%) and 16 from Ecoli
(9.88%). The MP and non—MP datasets are made available at http://
kiharalab.org/MPpredictionl.

2.2 Feature computation and selection

As MPs have dual functions, intuitively they interact with more pro—
teins with different functions compared with non—MPs. In our previ—
ous work (Khan et (11., 2014), we have characterized MPs and non—
MPs in terms of different omics—based features (including PPI, GE,
Phylo, GIs) and showed that when the interacting partners are clus—
tered based on their functional similarity, the number of clusters
tend to be higher for MP5 than non—MPs. Based on this analysis, we
develop the MPFit model in this work that uses the number of func—
tional clusters as the features to classify MPs and non—MPs.

To characterize MP and non—MPs we selected a broad range of
features, i.e. GO annotations, PPI network, GE profiles, Phylo, GIs,
disordered protein regions (DOR), and the protein’s graph proper—
ties in the PPI network (NET). In order to extract the feature for a
protein P, in any information domain, we first extracted the GO
terms or proteins associated with P, in that domain and built a net—
work N, for P, Each node in N, can be either a GO term (if the in—
formation domain is GO) or a protein (if the information domain is
any of the omics—based information); edges in N, represent associ—
ation weights among nodes. Then we applied single linkage cluster—
ing on N, and the number of clusters at several score thresholds
were selected as features of P, (Khan et (11., 2014). Figure 1 illustrates
the feature computation procedure for human aconitase (acol), an
MP, for the PPI network. First, we extracted interacting partners for
acol, then based on the GO annotation similarity score of the inter—
acting partners, the PPI network was clustered and four clusters
were obtained with a certain similarity cutoff 1'. Two of these clusters
(circled in red) contain proteins related to the (tricarboxylic acid)
TCAcycle and are associated to the first function of deal while an—
other cluster (green) was relevant to the second function. Such clus—
tering was performed with five different similarity cutoffs (from 0.1
to 0.9 with an interval of 0.2), which resulted in a clustering profile
shown in the bottom of Figure 1. Finally, we extracted the number
of clusters at multiple score cutoffs as the PPI network features.
More details about the feature computation in the PPI network do—
main are provided in the Supplementary Figure S1.

To construct the GE network, expression profiles were obtained
from the COEXPRESdb database (Okamura et (11., 2014). Gene
pairs that have an absolute value of their Pearson correlation of ex—
pression levels within the top 2% among all the pairs were con—
nected in the network. Phylo network was constructed using the
STRING database (Szklarczyk et (11., 2014). A protein pair was
connected in the network if they have a sufficient score (>0.7 as rec—
ommended by STRING) at ‘neighborhood’, ‘co—occurrence’ or
‘gene—fusion’ in STRING. For the GI network, we used the
BIOGRID database (Stark et (11., 2006) and extracted gene pairs that
had the ‘experiment type’ listed as ‘genetic’ to be associated in the
GI network. For the NET feature, three graph properties of proteins,
namely, degree centrality, closeness centrality and between—ness cen—
trality, based on the PPI network were computed as features. For the
DOR feature, using the D2P2 database (Oates et (11., 2013), we com—
puted three properties of protein’s intrinsically disordered regions,
namely, the number and the total length of disordered regions as
well as the proportion of disordered regions in the sequence.

2.3 Missing data imputation
In order to deal with missing data, imputation is an approach that
fills in the missing data rather than discarding the data points

entirely and using only the complete subset of the data. Among
known imputation approaches, there are methods that fill in the
missing feature from mean or median of the known values of the
same features in other instances (Little and Rubin, 1987; Zloba
2002). On the other hand, there are methods that perform partial
imputation based on known features of small neighborhood of the
incomplete data (Morin and Raeside, 1981; Zhang, 2008). In this
work, we used a RF—based imputation technique (Breiman, 2001;
Liaw, 2003). Figure 2A—B shows the procedure. In Figure 2A, the
training dataset is represented as a matrix where rows are proteins
and columns are features. Missing features in the dataset are repre—
sented by NAs. The algorithm starts by replacing NAs with the col—
umn medians. Then a RF was constructed using the temporally
filled features in the previous step (pseudo—complete data in Fig.
2A). Next, the proximity matrix from the RF was used to update the
imputed values of the NAs. The (i, /) element of the proximity ma—
trix is the fraction of trees in which the proteins 1' and /' fall in the
same class. The imputed value for a feature is the weighted average
of the non—missing features from other proteins, where weights are
the proximities. The imputation was iterated until the proximity
matrixes converged or the procedure is iterated 10 times. Finally, a
RF Rme was computed with this imputed training data matrix.

In order to impute missing features in the test set (Fig. 2B), the
training dataset with missing values imputed was used to compute
two filler vectors (referred to as MP—filler and non—MP—filler), one
for each of the MP and non—MP classes. The 1th element of the filler
vector MP—filler (non—MP—filler) is the mean of the imputed features
at the ith column of the training matrix with the MP (non—MP) class
label. The test dataset was represented as a matrix similar to the
training data (rows are proteins, columns are features). For the test
data row rite“, since the label (MP/non—MP) is not known, two repli—
cates were made: the missing features in the first replicate were filled
with the MP—filler and the same for the second replicate was filled

with the non—MP—filler vector. Now these two completed test repli—
cates were run down through the previously trained RF Rme. Each
protein receives tree votes of MP and non—MP in Rth,“ from repli—
cates 1 and 2, and the higher vote between the MP vote in replicate
1 and the non—MP vote in replicate 2 finally determines the MP/non—
MP—fillers to be used in the missing features of the protein. In Figure
2B, the first protein received higher MP votes from replicate 1 (290
votes) over non—MP votes from replicate 2 (50 votes); thus, the miss—
ing features of the protein are filled with the MP—filler vector.
Finally, proteins in the test set were predicted to be MP or non—MP
using a classifier. When RF was used for the classifier, this voting
was used as the final prediction. We have also used support vector
machine (SVM) and naive—Baiyes as the final classifier and com—
pared the results.

Aside from this explicit RF—based imputation technique, an alter—
native imputation method (termed as ‘probabilistic imputation’)
was used in this work where the splitting probabilities in the RF
were learned from the subset of complete data and later used to clas—
sify the incomplete data. Detail of this method is discussed in
Supplementary Figure S4 and its associated text.

3 Results

In this section, we present and discuss the performance of MPFit
with different combinations of features. MPFit was run and eval—
uated with the GO term feature and all possible combinations of six
omics feature domains (namely, PPI, GE, Phylo, GI, DOR and
NET). There are 1+ (26 — 1): 64 such combinations.

3.1 lmputation of missing features facilitates usage

of omics data

For a given combination of omics features, there are proteins which
lack some of the feature data. One way to handle such missing data
by a classifier is to impute the missing data so that a classifier trained
on the full features can be applied. Figure 3 contrasts the number of
target proteins that were predicted by MPFit before and after the im—
putation. A point represents one of the 64 feature combinations. For
each feature combination considered, proteins that have at least one
feature were subject to imputation and those that do not have any
features are discarded (data points in Fig. 3 with under 100% pro—
tein coverage after imputation).

for a certain feature combination

It is evident that the imputation technique substantially increased
the dataset coverage, which also consequently improved classifier
performance as explained in later sections. For example, the number
of MP proteins for a feature combination of (PPI, Phylo, GE, GI,
DOR) was originally 8 (2.9%), which increased to 192 (71.7%)
after imputation. The features with 100% coverage after imputation
are seven single features, GO, GE, Phylo, PPI, GI, NET and DOR.

3.2 Prediction accuracy of MPs

Next, we discuss prediction performance of MPFit using RF
(Breiman, 2001) as the final classifier in the pipeline (Fig. 2B).
Prediction performance was evaluated by a weighted class average
F—score, where the F—score was computed separately for MP and
non—MP protein classes and weighted by the number of proteins in
the corresponding class. The F—score is defined as (2"precision"'re—
call)/(precision+recall), where precision and recall are defined as
(TP/(TP+FP)) and (TP/(FP+FN)), respectively. Here, TP, FP and
FN stand for true positive, false positive and false negative, respect—
ively. Figure 4 presents results with the seven single features as well
as the five combinations of features that showed the highest F—score.
Average F—score from a 5 —fold cross—validation was reported.

When proteins have GO annotations, it is shown that prediction
can be very accurate, with an F—score of 0.993. Among the six indi—
vidual omics features, GE showed the best F—score of 0.710, and the
rest of the features performed similarly (F—scores range from 0.597
to 0.651). Results of all the possible combinations of omics features
are provided in Supplementary Figure S2. Their F—scores range from
0.784 to 0.571. Among the feature combinations, Phylo + GI
showed highest accuracy (precision, recall and F—score are 0.799, 0.
771 and 0.784, respectively), followed by Phylo + GI +NET and
Phylo +NET. However, these three combinations have relatively
low coverage (Fig. 4), while the fourth and fifth best performing fea—
Phylo + GE + GI + DOR + NET and
PPI + Phylo + GE, have a high coverage with good F—scores that are
close to the best value achieved by Phylo + GI (0.7964, 0.7602 for
coverage and 0.7109, 0.7538, for F—score, respectively). For this rea—
son we used the fourth and fifth feature combinations in the

ture combinations,

Genome—scale prediction of MP5

genome—scale prediction performed in the subsequent section.
Among the proteins in MoonProt, there are five protein pairs from
the same organism that have over 25% sequence identity. We
removed five proteins, one from each of these similar protein pairs
and recomputed the F—score with cross—validation for the two—fea—
Phylo + GE + GI + DOR + NET and
PPI+Phylo+GE. The changes of F—score were marginal: an in—

ture combinations,

crease of 0.87 and 3.09 were observed for the former and the latter
combinations, respectively.

Here, we discuss two cases where combinations of different
omics—based features improved prediction over single feature. The
first example is a MP in human, which is a ribosomal protein (part
of the 60S subunit) (UniProt ID: P46777) (Horn and Vousden,
2008). The secondary function of this protein is inhibition of
HDM2, an ubiquitin ligase, which results in stabilization of the p53
tumor suppressor protein. Using only the PPI features, this protein is
incorrectly predicted as non—MP. This is because 63 interacting pro—
teins in the PPI network have a relatively small number of functional
clusters for MP. When clustered using functional similarity (funsim)
scores for BP and MF combined (see Supplementary Figure S1B), the
relative number of clusters stay below 0.32 at each clustering cutoff,
which is significantly lower compared with the MP distribution.
However, the protein was correctly predicted as MP with the
PPI+Phylo + GE combination. Twenty—five associated proteins for
this target in the Phylo network were clustered in to 2, 3, 3, 3 and
24 groups at similarity cutoffs 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 of the fun—
sim score, which are larger than the non—MP distribution
(Supplementary Figure S5A). Thus for this protein, addition of
Phylo features made the prediction correct.

The second example is DNA replication factor Cdt1 (UniProt
ID: Q9H211) (Varma et (11., 2012). Besides its primary function as
DNA replication factor, this MP’s secondary function is a role in mi—
tosis where it localizes to kinetochores through binding to the Hec1
component of the Ndc80 complex. Using PPI features only, this pro—
tein is incorrectly predicted as non—MP, because its 29 interacting
proteins in the PPI network do not have sufficient number of func—
tionally different groups. Clustering using the funsim BP + MF
score, the relative number of clusters stays below 0.35, which is
significantly lower than the MP distribution. However, the
PPI + Phylo +NET feature combination made correct prediction as
MP. This is partly because the NET feature of this protein has high
values, e.g. a between—ness centrality of 0.267, which is high (above
75 percentile) for this feature’s distribution for MP (Supplementary
Figure S5 B).

We also ran MPFit with RF without imputation, i.e. only on pro—
teins that do not have any missing feature in a feature combination.
The results for all the feature combinations are shown in
Supplementary Figure S3. Skipping imputation substantially lowers
coverage (Fig. 4, and Supplementary Figures S2 and S3). Without
imputation the coverage decreases as the number of features in a
combination increases, which resulted in 0 coverage for 16 out of 64
cases (Supplementary Figure S3). Also, the data sizes of MP and
non—MP classes become substantially different and imbalanced for
several feature combinations. In contrast, imputation not only in—
creases prediction coverage but also improves accuracy by increas—
ing the size of the training set, as indicated by the cases that
improved F—score by imputation.

We examined prediction performance of MPFit when naive
Bayes (Andrew and Kamal, 1998) or SVM (Cortes and Vapnik,
1995), was used as the last classifier in the procedure. As explained
with Figure 2, the missing data imputation was performed with RF,
and naive Bayes or SVM was applied as the final classifier to

proteins with full imputed features. Results with all 64 feature com—
binations were shown in comparison with the results by RF in
Figure 5. Results in the lower triangle in Figure 5 are the cases where
RF performed better than the counterpart. It is apparent that RF
performed better than SVM and naive Bayes for the majority of the
cases. Using the GO term features showed the highest F—score by all
the classifiers (the upper right corner of Fig. 5). F—scores of feature
combinations by the three classifiers correlated moderately. The cor—
relation coefficient between RF and naive Bayes was highest, 0.828,
that for RF with SVM was 0.542, and between SVM and naive
Bayes it was 0.561. Our speculation for RF outperforming SVM is
that the fairly low number of features used in this work is probably
more suitable for RF than SVM, which is shown to perform well for
a high dimensional feature space (Caruana et (11., 2008).

We also computed cross—validation F—score for the alternative
imputation technique (termed as ‘probabilistic imputation’) and
compared the result with the F—score shown in Figure 4 with explicit
imputation. The result is discussed in Supplementary Figure S4 with
the conclusion that explicit imputation outperforms the probabilistic
imputation.

To summarize this section, MP and non—MP can be classified
very accurately by MPFit when GO terms of the proteins are avail—
able. Encouragingly, prediction can be made with a sufficient accur—
acy even when no function annotation is available using proper
combinations of omics—based features. Missing feature imputation
increases the coverage of proteins that are subject to prediction and
also helps to improve accuracy by increasing the training data of a
classifier. Among the three classifiers tested, RF performed better
than SVM and naive Bayes.

3.3 Genome—wide prediction of MPs

In the last section of this work, we report genome—wide prediction
of MPs performed with MPFit on three genomes, S.cerevisiae
(yeast), Celegans and human. We used two feature combinations
that gave high performance in both F—score and coverage (Fig. 4):
Phylo + GE + GI + DOR + NET and PPI + Phylo + GE. MPFit with
the two feature combinations were run separately with explicit fea—
ture imputation and RF as the last classifier. Then, proteins that
were predicted as MP5 by consensus of both runs were taken as
plausible MPs. Consensus was taken to only count highly plausible
MPs and avoid over—estimation of the MP fraction in the genomes.

For MPFit runs with a feature combination, proteins were discarded
if they had no features in the combination. In the yeast genome,
which has 6718 proteins in UniProt (UniProt Consortium, 2014),
there were 4673 proteins (69.6%) that had at least one feature
among PPI, Phylo or GE, and 5845 proteins (87.0%) that had at
least one feature in Phylo, GE, GI, DOR or NET. The coverages for
Celegans are 79.8% and 89.5%, while that for the human genome
are 68.1 and 82.4%, respectively for the PPI + Phylo + GE and
Phylo + GE + GI+ DOR + NET feature combinations. The results
are summarized in Table 1. A list of predicted MP5 is available at
http://kiharalab.org/MPpredictionl

First, we examined if known MPs listed in the MoonProt database
in each genome were correctly predicted as MP5. The results in the se—
cond column from the right in Table 1 show that MPFit predicts
known MPs reasonably well with recall of over 73% to each genome.

Next, we moved onto the blind genome—wide prediction to the
three genomes. In yeast, MPFit with the two feature combinations
Phylo + GE + GI + DOR + NET and PPI + Phylo + GE predicted
24.6 and 18.5% of the proteins as MP5, respectively, and among
them, 10.9% of the proteins have a consensus prediction as MP5
with the two feature sets. We note that this number of MPs in yeast
is similar to the numbers obtained by a recent work by a different
group (Pritykin et al., 2015). In human, 67.6% of the total genome
was subject to MPFit by both feature combinations, and 7.8% of
the total genome was predicted as MP by consensus of the two fea—
ture combinations.

In Celegans, 79.8% of proteins were subject to prediction by the
two feature combinations. For this genome, the two feature combin—
ations showed difference in the number of proteins predicted as
MP5. With the Phylo + GE + GI + DOR + NET combination,
15.4% of the proteins were predicted as MP5 while the fraction was
4.0% using the PPI +Phylo+ GE combination, which resulted in a
consensus of 2.73% of the proteins predicted as MP5. The fraction
of predicted MPs by the latter feature combination was particularly
lower than the other mainly because 48.5% of the predicted MPs by
Phylo + GE + GI + DOR + NET were not subject to prediction with
the PPI + Phylo + GE combination due to missing features.

To date there are two methods that predict whether a protein is
MP or not. A method by Chapple et al. (2015) considers a protein as
MP if it is within an overlapping cluster in the PPI network and fur—
ther passes a GO—based analysis. Out of the 45 known MPs in
human in MoonProt, only 3 were predicted by this method (recall
0.0667). The method by Pritykin et al. 2015) uses GO—based multi—
functional filtering criteria to predict MPs. Their method predicted

yeast than the two methods.

3.4 Analysis of Genome—wide MP prediction

We examined functions of predicted MPs in the three genomes by
considering GO and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes
(KEGG) pathway association (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000). In order
to assign a protein to GO categories, we first mapped its GO anno—
tations onto the terms at the second depth in the GO hierarchy, and
performed GO enrichment analysis (NaviGO at http://kiharalab.
org/web/compare.php). Table 2 lists the enriched GO categories of
the predicted MPs. This GO analysis covers 100%, 99.3%, and 99.
9% of predicted MPs in yeast, C.elegans and human, respectively,
which have GO annotations. Table 3 is a list of associations of the
predicted MPs to KEGG pathways. Note that this analysis was
based on the predicted MPs that exist in KEGG (Kanehisa and
Goto, 2000) database (66.36, 35.21 and 51.92% in yeast, C.elegans
and human genomes, respectively).

In Tables 2 and 3, the major proportion of MP5 is enzymes. This
observation is consistent with previous reports that many MPs were
known primarily as enzymes when their secondary function was dis—
covered (Hernandez et al., 2014; Jeffery, 2003; Mani et al., 2014).

Ribosome was listed as a KEGG pathway for the three genomes.
An example is 40S ribosomal protein S3 (Uniprot ID: P23396) in
human, which functions primarily as a ribosomal protein (part of
the 40S subunit), and has a second function of being a subunit of a
DNA—binding complex involved in NF—kappaB—mediated transcrip—
tion (Wan et al., 2007). The second example of MP5 is glyceralde—
hyde—3—phosphate dehydrogenase (UniProt ID: P04406) in human.
Besides its primary function as enzyme in the glycolysis pathway,
this protein moonlights as interferon—gamma—activated inhibitor of
translation that silences ceruloplasmin mRNA translation (Sampath
et al., 2004). In a proteomics study (Prunotto et al., 2013), this pro—
tein was identified as one of the urinary exosome proteins, and thus
contains GO:0070062 extracellular exosome, which is a child term
of GO:0005576 extracellular region, and hence falls in the latter
GO category in Table 2. Both are these examples are correctly pre—
dicted MPs in human by the two omics—based combinations
Phylo + GE + GI + DOR + NET and PPI + Phylo + GE.

4 Discussion

We proposed a novel computational approach, MPFit, for detecting
MP5 from GO annotations or omics—based features. MPFit can be
applied to a large fraction of proteins in a genome due to the use of
several omics—based features and the implemented imputation proto—
col for filling missing features. As the mechanisms by which MPs ex—
hibit multiple functions differ from case by case, using various
feature types is reasonable to capture MP5 of different nature.

Although there is a possibility that some predictions made by
MPFit are not correct, the overall estimation is probably not too far
from the truth and serves as workable hypotheses for future research
projects. We believe that our work is an imperative step toward a
systematic and integrative approach of studying MPs and it will
open up new opportunities to investigate the multi—functional nature
of proteins at a systems level.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (T NF) initiates a complex
series of biochemical events in the cell upon binding to its type
R1 receptor (T NF-R1). Recent experimental work has unravelled the
molecular regulation of the signalling complexes that lead either
to cell survival or death. Survival signals are activated by direct
binding of TNF to TNF-R1 at the cell membrane whereas apoptotic
signals by endocytosed TNF/TNF-R1 complexes. Here we describe
a reduced, effective model with few free parameters, where we group
some intricate mechanisms into effective modules, that successfully
describes this complex set of actions. We study the parameter space
to show that the model is structurally stable and robust over a broad
range of parameter values.

Results: We use state-of-the-art Bayesian methods (a Sequential
Monte Carlo sampler) to perform inference of plausible values of the
model parameters from experimental data. As a result, we obtain a
robust model that can provide a solid basis for further modelling of
TNF signalling. The model is also suitable for inclusion in multi-scale
simulation programs that are presently under development to study
the behaviour of large tumour cell populations.

Availability: We provide supplementary material that includes all
mathematical details and all algorithms (Matlab code) and models
(SBML descriptions).

1 INTRODUCTION

Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF) is a cytokine that acts as a
key regulator of immune functions (Ashkenazi and Dixit, 1998;
Tracey and Cerami, 1994; Wallach et (11., 1999). TNF is the
prototypical member of a growing family of cytokines (Locksley
et (11., 2001) but, unlike the other members, it can trigger intracellular
signals that lead either to cell survival and proliferation or death
(Ashkenazi and Dixit, 1998; Locksley et (11., 2001; Tracey and
Cerami, 1994; Wallach et (11., 1999). This dual role is important in
the regulation of immune response, because it provides a molecular

basis to cellular homeostasis. These opposing signals might lead to
inhibition of tumour growth or, on the contrary, to the promotion of
tumour development through direct (see, e.g. Tucker et (11., 2004)
and indirect mechanisms [e.g. by tissue remodelling and stromal
development (Balkwill, 2002)]. This motivates a detailed study of
the molecular mechanisms involved in TNF signalling.

Many molecular actors of this complex intracellular machinery
have been discovered and studied in a variety of cells (see Wajant
et (11., 2003, for a comprehensive review). This has attracted the
attention of modellers who have attempted to unravel the switching
mechanism that leads either to cell survival or death, using standard
methods of systems biology (Calzone et (11., 2010; Cho et (11., 2003;
EiBing et (11., 2004; 2005; Lipniacki et (11., 2004; Rangamani and
Sirovich, 2007). They have mostly stressed the interplay among
intracellular molecules and the network of reactions stimulated
by the binding of TNF to its type 1 receptor (TNF-R1). Recent
data show that the path that leads to cell survival is triggered by
TNF binding to its receptor at the cell membrane, while the cell-
death pathway is triggered by internalized TNF/receptor complexes
(Micheau and Tschopp, 2003; Schneider-Brachert et (11., 2004).
Here, we focus on this important bifurcation and develop a reduced
model of TNF action, and we use modern statistical techniques to
estimate the model parameters.

2 MODEL OF TNF ACTION

2.1 Binding and internalization

A review of TNF signalling is provided in the Supplementary
Material. Here we brieﬂy recall that TNF is a homotrimeric molecule
that binds to two different receptors, TNF-R1 and TNF-R2, and that
TNF-R1 appears to be the key molecule in both normal and tumour
cells. Current biochemical data show that the TNF-R1 receptors
rapidly self-trimerize at the cell membrane because of the Pre-
Ligand Assembly Domain, and interact with TNF homotrimers
(Chan et (11., 2000). The process of receptor trimerization is much
faster than the binding kinetics, and the trimerized receptor behaves
as an effective monomer, therefore TNF binding to TNF-R1 can
be viewed as the result of a monomeric interaction between
one molecule of TNF and one molecule of receptor. With this
simpliﬁcation we can drop 3 equations and 6 parameters from the
model, and obtain a better identiﬁcation of the remaining parameters.

Fig. 1. Map of the modules that describe the main known TNF
intracellular signalling pathways. The ovals show the modules that pack
several key mechanismsiincluding the complex biomechanical process
of internalization into endocytic vesiclesiand replace them with effective
actions. and the squares indicate the kinetic parameters. Lines terminating
with a bar indicate known inhibitory pathways. The model does not
differentiate between death mechanisms and this is because we ﬁt model
equations to experimental cytotoxicity data that discriminate between live
and dead cells only. This ﬁgure is reproduced at a larger scale in the
Supplementary Material (Supplementary Fig. SFl).

Here, we use an updated version of a model of Bajzer et (11. (Baj zer
et (11., 1989; Vuk-Pavlovic and Kovach, 1989) to describe the early
events of TNF interaction with cells. Bajzer et (11. assumed that
internalized ligand/receptor complexes could be recycled back to
the cell surface, however recent data show that the ﬁnal fate of the
endosomes containing TNF complexes is to maturate to lysosomes
by progressive ﬁision with vesicles from the trans-Golgi network
loaded with lysosomal enzymes (Schneider-Brachert et (11., 2004),
and it is very likely that TNF/TNF—Rl complexes do not recycle at
all but are ﬁnally degraded into lysosomes. Therefore, we modify
the model as follows (see Fig. 1, and the Supplementary Material).
We assume a steady ﬂow of TNF receptors, so that their number in
the cell membrane is held constant: this is described by the zero-
order rate constant Vr. The rate kd regulates the internalization of
ligand-free TNF-R1 receptors. A receptor complex RC forms at the
cell membrane upon binding of TNF to TNF-R1, with rate constants
km and koff. This complex is internalized into cells (Rm) with rate
constant kin, and the internalized ligand/receptor complexes can
ﬁnally be degraded (Rindeg) with rate constant kdeg.

2.2 Life and death pathways

Figure 1 shows the modules that represent the main mechanisms
triggered by TNF binding to its receptors. This is suggested by
the recent work of Schneider-Brachert et (11. (2004) that elegantly
demonstrates that the pathway leading to NF-KB activation and
cell survival is initiated at the cell membrane upon formation of
TNF/TNF-Rl complexes, while the one that leads to apoptosis
and cell death is initiated by complexes that are internalized
into endocytic vescicles. In addition to the basic observations
of Schneider-Brachert et (11., we include the NF-KB-mediated
transcription of genes coding for caspase-8 inhibitors such as
FLIP. In this way, the intracellular pathways interact dynamically,

because the cell survival pathway—that starts earlier since it does
not require internalization of TNF/TNF-Rl complexes—can inhibit
the apoptotic path. Here, we model both biochemical circuits by
means of only two modules, A and B, that denote the paths
leading either to death or to cell survival, respectively. We assume
that after the initial trigger both pathways proceed irreversibly
to their endpoint. The production of B depends on the number
RC of TNF—TNF-Rl complexes on the cell membrane, with rate
constant (3. Likewise, the production of A depends on the number of
internalized ligand/receptor complexes Rm, with rate constant a. The
cell survival pathway inhibits the apoptotic reactions in A with rate
y[B]. Finally, molecules in bothA and B can be degraded by means of
ubiquitination and proteasome cleavage and/or irreversibly inhibited
by other molecular species, and these processes are described by
the rate constants kAdeg and deeg, respectively. Eventually, we
merge the necrotic and apoptotic paths introducing a single surviving
fraction f (t). The complete model is:

where we have introduced the concentrations of free receptors
(Rf) and free ligands (TNF) in addition to those deﬁned above.
At the population level, Equation (1g) represents the dynamics of
the surviving fraction f (I), while at the single-cell level f (t) can
be interpreted as the probability that a cell is still alive at time t
and K[A] is the rate for a single-hit death mechanism: this notion
is supported by a number of different cytotoxicity experiments,
see, e.g. Carmichael et (11. (1993); Chapman (2003); Leﬂ<ovits
and Waldmann (1979); Neville and Hudson (1986); Tubiana et (11.
(1990). Notice also that if [A] is approximately constant in the
time range (I,I+At), we recover a familiar formula for the
surviving fraction: f (1+ At) = f (t)exp(—K[A]At). The complete list
of parameters that we infer from experimental data is given in
Supplementary Table STl.

3 METHODS AND RESULTS

3.1 Bayesian inference

We split the analysis of the TNF signalling model in two stages. First
we used the data of Grell et a1. (1998) to infer suitable kinetics for TNF
receptor binding and internalization. A model containing only the receptor
internalization module. Equations (laild) is provided in the Supplementary
Material as a separate SBML ﬁle. At the second stage of our analysis. we
used the complete model (lailg) to perform model parameter inference
from the cytotoxicity data of Scherf et a1. (1996). We used the Bayesian
inference framework to perform knowledge updating based on experimental

evidence. This framework employs probability distributions to express one’s
conﬁdence in values of quantitative model parameters. It requires the a priori'
choice of suitable distributions of parameter values. Afterwards. a consistent
mathematical procedure is used to combine these prior distributions with
experimental evidence and produce corresponding a posteriori parameter
distributions. Our choice of priors is based on the existing knowledge of
biochemical kinetics involved in similar signalling networks. We use wide
log-normal distributions in ranges of model parameters which would be
considered reasonable by biochemists working in this ﬁeld; for example. no
a priori' support is assigned to negative parameter values. as we require non-
negative parameter values. We have selected reasonable parameter ranges
based on the existing literature: detailed justiﬁcations are given in the
Supplementary Material. We employ a Sequential Monte Carlo sampler
proposed by Del Moral et a1. (2006) to produce parameter posteriors. A
detailed description of this method as well as our complete MATLAB code
of the sampler is given in the Supplementary Material.

3.2 Binding and internalization kinetics

The ﬁrst stage of our analysis requires the accurate knowledge of several
experimental conditions. selecting the optimal experimental data is not
trivial and requires careful inspection of an extensive scientiﬁc literature.
Finally we chose the data of Grell et a1. (1998) for the reasons given in
the Supplementary Material. Figure 2 shows the data in Grell at (11.. along
with the predictions drawn from our model. given the parameter posterior
identiﬁed using this dataset. Column 2 of Supplementary Table ST5 lists the
maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates of the relevant model parameters.
It must be noted that existing data did not allow a unique parameter
identiﬁcation. and the resulting posterior has high variance. This result.
however. is still useful. as it is used as a prior for the next stage of our analysis.
where it is updated with more experimental data. A detailed description of
the obtained posterior can be found in the Supplementary Material.

3.3 Dose/response cytotoxicity assays

Since Grell et a1. (1998) did not report background values in their
spectrophotometry measurements of cell viability. these data cannot be used
for cytotoxicity estimates. and we take the data in Scherf et a1. (1996) to
estimate the remaining parameters. Scherf et a1. measured TNF cytotoxicity
against MCF7 (human breast carcinoma cells) and Colo205 (human colon
carcinoma cells) by the 3 [H]-leucine incorporation assay. a method with very
low background. We employed the posterior obtained at the ﬁrst stage of our
analysis as the prior for receptor binding parameters at the second stage.
The rest of the parameters were assigned weakly informative priors based
on existing biochemical literature. MAP estimates of the model parameters
are given in Supplementary Tables ST7 and ST8. and the corresponding
model predictions are shown in Figure 3. as well as in Supplementary
Figures SF6 and SF7. We wish to stress that the inference procedures
have uncovered important correlations between the parameters. that are
properly expressed by the covariance and correlation matrices reported in the
Supplementary Material. Marginalized posterior distributions of individual
model parameters are also shown in Supplementary Figures SF87SF11.

3.4 Model validation and robustness

Independent biochemical data on the expression kinetics of proteins in
modulesA and B were used to validate the prediction capabilities of the model
(Supplementary Figs SF15 and SF16). Using the estimated parameters. we
ﬁnd that the surviving fraction after TNF administration is a nearly sigmoid
function of the initial TNF concentration for all times (see Fig. 4). Thus
the model provides a very speciﬁc prediction using the set of parameters
from the Bayesian estimate. and we have investigated its robustness with
respect to parameter changes. using the parameter values in Supplementary
Tables ST7 and ST8 as starting points for the numerical study. There are 5
parameters that regulate the interplay of theA and B pathways. 01. )3. y. kAdCg

We carried out an extensive numerical exploration of this 5-dimensional
parameter space. as a function of TNF concentration. To this end. parameters
were varied on a regular logarithmic grid in a range corresponding to the
extremes of the marginalized posterior distributions shown in Supplementary
Figures SF87SF11. scaled by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude in either direction
(see Supplementary Figs SF18 and SF19 and the detailed description in the
Supplementary Material). This analysis shows that the model does not change
its qualitative behaviour even with very large parameters perturbations.
that no unexpected and/or undesired patterns emerge. and that the model
describes the balance between cell survival and death for a broad range of
parameter values. We conclude that the model is structurally stable and robust
(Strogatz. 1994).

4 DISCUSSION

The modular model sketched in Figure 1, and deﬁned by
Equations (la—1g) is a robust, structurally stable description of the
dual TNF action. Although it replaces an accurate description of
known mechanisms with effective actions, it provides a solid basis
for more elaborate models, it establishes kinetic bounds for model

TNF of various cell lines. The model is also suitable for integration
into complex multi-scale simulation programs of tumour growth
such as VBL (Chignola and Milotti, 2004; Milotti and Chignola,
2010), or other computational models (Dionysiou and Stamatakos,
2006; Jiang et (11., 2005; Wang and Deisboeck, 2009). We plan to use
the model to explore in detail the response of tumour cell clusters to
TNF therapy and to investigate tumour/immune system interaction
dynamics.

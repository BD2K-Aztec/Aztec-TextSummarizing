ABSTRACT

Motivation: Next-generation genotyping microarrays have been de-
signed with insights from 1000 Genomes Project and whole-exome
sequencing studies. These arrays additionally include variants that are
typically present at lower frequencies. Determining the genotypes of
these variants from hybridization intensities is challenging because
there is less support to locate the presence of the minor alleles
when the allele counts are low. Existing algorithms are mainly de-
signed for calling common variants and are notorious for failing to
generate accurate calls for low-frequency and rare variants. Here,
we introduce a new calling algorithm, iCall, to call genotypes for vari-
ants across the whole spectrum of allele frequencies.

Results: We benchmarked iCall against four of the most commonly
used algorithms, GenCall, optiCall, illuminus and GenoSNP, as well as
a post-processing caller zCall that adopted a two-stage calling design.
Normalized hybridization intensities for 12370 individuals genotyped
on the Illumina HumanExome BeadChip were considered, of which 81
individuals were also whole-genome sequenced. The sequence calls
were used to benchmark the accuracy of the genotype calling, and our
comparisons indicated that iCall outperforms all four single-stage call-
ing algorithms in terms of call rates and concordance, particularly in
the calling accuracy of minor alleles, which is the principal concern
for rare and low-frequency variants. The application of zCall to post-
process the output from iCall also produced marginally improved
performance to the combination of zCall and GenCall.

Availability and implementation: iCall is implemented in C++ for use
on Linux operating systems and is available for download at http://
www.statgen.nus.edu.sg/~softwareﬁcallhtml.

1 INTRODUCTION

Statistical algorithms have automated the process of calling the
genotypes in large-scale microarray genotyping where up to 5 mil-
lion variants can be assayed simultaneously. This process has
been predominantly applied to probes that query two possible
allelic outcomes at a genomic variant (generically deﬁned as

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

allele A and allele B), and the degree of hybridization to each
of the two alleles is reﬂected by the ﬂuorescence intensity.
Translating both sets of allelic hybridization intensities thus
allow discrete decisions to be made with respect to whether the
genotype of a sample at a particular single nucleotide poly-
morphism (SNP) should be AA, AB or BB. Occasionally,
when the hybridization intensities do not offer sufﬁcient support
for one of the discrete calls, a NULL call can be made, which is
subsequently treated as missing.

Numerous algorithms have been developed to call genotypes
for earlier generations of microarrays on both the Affymetrix
and Illumina platforms. They can be broadly classiﬁed into
five categories: (i) single-sample single-SNP calling such as the
Dynamic Model (Di et al., 2005), where only the intensity meas-
urements at each SNP are considered, disregarding whether there
were other samples genotyped at the same time; (ii) multi-sample
single-SNP calling such as the GenCall (in the proprietary soft-
ware BeadStudio and GenomeStudio) and illuminus (Teo et al.,
2007), where the intensity measurements at each SNP across
multiple samples are jointly considered in a cluster analysis
framework to learn about genotype cluster characteristics before
making the calls; (iii) single-sample multi-SNP calling such as
GenoSNP (Giannoulatou et al., 2008), which does not rely on
parameters derived from multiple samples; (iv) hybrid calling
such as optiCall (Shah et al., 2012), where a prior distribution
is generated using multi-sample and multi-SNP data even though
the actual calling is performed within each SNP; and (V) linkage
disequilibrium-aware calling such as MAMS Oiiao et al., 2007;
Yu et al., 2009) and the approach by Browning and colleagues
(Browning and Yu, 2009), where the signal intensities from mul-
tiple SNPs are jointly evaluated using the correlation structure
between SNPs to improve the accuracy of the calls.

Early generations of genotyping microarrays prioritized tag-
ging SNPs identified from the International HapMap Project
(Frazer et al., 2007) that are selected on their ability to provide
adequate coverage of the human genome in the HapMap popu-
lations, and are typically common SNPs with minor allele
frequency (MAF) that exceeded 5%. The design of next-
generation genotyping microarrays has been guided by the
data from the 1000 Genomes Project and other whole-exome
sequencing studies to increase genome coverage and to include
low-frequency and rare variants (defined as SNPs with MAF

Fig. 1. Illustration of hybridization intensity proﬁles for three different
SNPs at both the allelic intensities axes and the transformed contrast-
scale axes. The three SNPs correspond to (i) a common SNP with MAF
35% (panels A and B); (ii) a polymorphic SNP with MAF <5% (panels
C and D); (iii) a common SNP with shifted intensity clusters (panels E
and F). In each panel, the assigned genotypes are colored accordingly as
AA (red), AB (green) and BB (blue)

between 1 and 5%, and SNPs with MAF< 1%, respectively) that
are often ancestry-speciﬁc (Mathieson and McVean, 2012).

Although genotype calling for these next-generation arrays
similarly relied on translating the hybridization intensities
(Fig. 1A and B), the lower allele frequency spectrum of the ma-
jority of these SNPs presents a significantly different challenge,
where only a small fraction of the samples is heterozygous and
there is usually no homozygous cluster for the alternate allele
(Fig. 1C and D). This can thwart algorithms that perform
multi-sample calling, as these algorithms, regardless of whether
they are maximum likelihood-based or rely on Bayesian models,
often set out to locate three genotype clusters. Shifts in the pos-
itions of the genotype clusters due to intrinsic hybridization
chemistry for a fraction of the SNPs can compound the problem
of multi-sample genotype calling (Fig. 1E and F).

In recognition of the challenges associated with calling the
genotypes for rare SNPs, a novel 2-stage calling strategy
(zCall) was introduced to post-process the genotype calls from
a default calling algorithm such as GenCall (Goldstein et al.,
2012). This relied on calibrating the positions of the other two
genotype clusters on the basis of the dominant homozygous clus-
ter to improve the accuracy and call rate.

In practice, the genotypes for bulk of the SNPs can be accur-
ately determined with straightforward rules in partitioning the
distinctively different hybridization intensities. However, SNPs
with lower MAF or with shifted intensities will not conform to
these simple rules and instead require more sophisticated statis-
tical strategies to accurately call genotypes. Here, we introduce a
new genotype calling strategy for Illumina arrays, iCall, which
performs multi-sample calling at a single SNP to improve accur-
acy across the full allele frequency spectrum. This algorithm
adopts the classical three-component student’s t-mixture model
framework that illuminus adopts, but focuses on deriving appro-
priate penalties to find the best seeding parameters to initialize

the expectationimaximization (EM) procedure to recognize the
variety of situations where calling becomes difficult, such as
when (i) the MAF is low; (ii) the total number of samples for
joint calling is small; or (iii) the hybridization intensities deviate
substantially from usual. Our method iCall is benchmarked
against four of the most commonly used single-stage algorithms
(optiCall, illuminus, GenoSNP and GenCall) as well as different
iterations of two-stage calling with zCall, with a large dataset of
12 370 samples that have been genotyped on the Illumina exome
chip, where 81 samples have been additionally whole-genome
sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2000 at a deep coverage of
30-fold. The sequencing calls for these samples were used to
derive a set of gold standard calls for calculating calling accur-
acy. Our algorithm has been implemented in a C++ program
that is available for public access.

2 METHODS
2.1 Normalized intensity data

As with optiCall and illuminus, iCall uses the normalized hybridiza-
tion intensities for the respective two alleles at each SNP that is
generated from the proprietary software GenomeStudio as the input.
We generally deﬁne the two alleles as A and B, and let (xj, yl) denote
the normalized intensities for sample j at a speciﬁc SNP. iCall transforms
the normalized intensities to the contrast-strength coordinate system
(cf, sf), where the contrast c, and strength s, for sample j are defined,
respectively, as

0 x1 —yj

= and s-=lo x-+ -.
J xj+yj J gl} y!)

2.2 Identifying the parameters to initialize calling

The performance of the genotype calling can depend crucially on the set
of initial calls used to seed the algorithm, especially if the mathematical
framework for initializing the calls is similar to the framework for sub-
sequent calling. For instance, if the initial set of calls already assumes the
presence of only one genotype cluster, subsequent iterations of a calling
algorithm will usually remain within the same domain space unless the
empirical data provide a strong motivation to introduce additional geno-
type clusters. iCall adopts a separate framework to generate the initial set
of calls by considering the information presented by the absolute contrast
measurements, or |cjl. When considered across multiple samples, the
density profile of the absolute contrast can inform the potential locations
of each genotype cluster (Fig. 2). A common SNP will usually yield a
density proﬁle with two distinct peaks (around 0 and 1 for the absolute
contrast respectively), whereas a rare or low-frequency SNP will give a

proﬁle with a small peak near 0 and a signiﬁcantly larger peak around 1,
and a monomorphic SNP will yield only one peak around 1. To model
this, we consider two scenarios: (i) the ﬁrst assumes a normal distribution
for |cj| ~ Normal(p., 02), and this aims to capture the situation when the
SNP is monomorphic; (ii) the second aims to identify the situation for a
non-monomorphic SNP and assumes a two-component normal mixture
model for |cj| such that

jcjj ~p > Normal(p.1, 012) + (1 —p) > Normal(p.2, 0%)

with 0 5 pl < 025 1, and all the parameters (17,01, 02,01, 0%) are esti-
mated from the data within an EM algorithm framework. The ﬁrst scen-
ario is actually a special case of the second scenario where p 2 pl 2 a? = 0.
To identify which scenario is more appropriate for the observed data, we
introduce a penalty as a function of (11.2 — 11.1) to calculate the penalized
log-likelihoods for both scenarios (where in scenario 1, m = 0, 11.2 = 0).
Otherwise, the two-component mixture model will always yield a higher
log-likelihood because of the better ﬁt of the data into two normal dis-
tributions with smaller variances.
The penalized log-likelihood functions are calculated as

Zlog(¢(lcrl: Ma 02)) + n > Sm)

and

for the joint calling, 1//(>) is the density function of a log-normal distribu-
tion with mean and variance of the distribution on the log scale equal to
meanlog and varriancelog, and d)() is the density function of a normal
distribution. The intuition here is when the values for 11.1 and 11.2 are not
signiﬁcantly different, the calling algorithm prefers to combine the two
components instead of forcing the presence of two clusters.

The scenario with the higher log-likelihood is chosen to generate eight
sets of location parameters to initialize the genotype calling in a three-
component univariate Gaussian mixture model for c], where the eight
sets are

where Q? denotes the 100x quantile value of the distribution of the
empirical c values. This allows the initialization parameters to be
guided by the observed values of c], which is particularly useful in the
situation where the intensities for the genotype clusters are shifted
signiﬁcantly.

2.3 Initializing the genotype calling

In initializing the EM procedure, each of the eight sets of location par-
ameters is used as the centers of a three-component univariate Gaussian
mixture model with equal weights for the contrast measurement. The
same standard deviation of 0.1 is assumed for the three genotype classes
in the ﬁrst three guided starts, and 0.05 (Q9:999 — Q3001) for the three
genotype classes in the other ﬁve guided starts. Two penalized log-
likelihood functions were calculated to select two sets of parameters
among the eight to seed the EM procedure: (i) the ﬁrst takes
  of  
where $002104W) with 1//(>) similarly representing
the density function of a log-normal distribution and d)() representing
the density function of a normal distribution; (ii) the second penalized
log-likelihood function shares the same form as the ﬁrst function, but has
an additional penalty calculated as the log-likelihood of the Hardy7
Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) percentile. The intuition behind the two
penalty terms is the ﬁrst term penalizes on small distances between the
heterozygous cluster and the two homozygous clusters, whereas the
second term penalizes on genotype call conﬁguration at a SNP that
deviates further from the state of HWE. Of the eight guided starts, we
identify the two guided starts (seedl, seedz) that yield the highest pena-
lized log-likelihood without and with the additional penalty on HWE,
respectively, and these two guided starts are subsequently used to seed the
genotype calling. Note that the two sets of seeding start may be identical
if the same guided start yields the highest penalized log-likelihoods in
both calculations.

2.4 Genotype calling

Each of the two sets of seeding starts is used to initialize the three-
component bivariate truncated t-mixture model that illuminus adopts
for x]: (cf, s), such that

evidence against HWE is more signiﬁcant in the conﬁguration generated
by seed] than the configuration generated by seedz, in which case the
genotype calls generated with seedz are accepted as the ﬁnal calls. This
minimizes the inadvertent miscalling that happens because of shifts in
genotype clouds resulting in genotype calls that tend to deviate from
HWE. As with illuminus, the posterior probability of each genotype
class for a sample is calculated after considering the intensity proﬁle of
the sample relative to those of all available samples, and a valid genotype
is assigned if the posterior probability exceeds a predetermined threshold
(iCall uses a default of 0.8). If the posterior probability for the NULL
category exceeds the threshold, or if none of the posterior probabilities
exceed the threshold, a NULL genotype call is assigned and this is con-
ventionally treated as a missing value.

2.5 Chromosomes X, Y and mitochondria

For calling genotypes at SNPs on the mitochondria and the non-pseudo-
autosomal regions of the sex chromosomes, the genotype calling
additionally requires information on the gender of each sample that
determines the direction of hybridization inactivation. For SNPs on
chromosome X, genotypes for females are determined in the same fashion
as autosomal SNPs, whereas the genotypes for males will only be called
as either AA or BB. For SNPs on chromosome Y, NULL calls will be
produced for females and the calling only considers the intensity data for
male samples and similarly yields genotype calls of either AA or BB. The
situation is reversed for SNPs on the mitochondria, where NULL calls
will be produced for males and the calling only considers the intensity
data for female samples and produces calls of either AA or BB.

3 RESULTS

The performance of iCall was compared against four single-stage
genotype calling algorithms: GenCall, optiCall, illuminus and
GenoSNP. Intensity data were available for 12 370 samples
that have been genotyped on the Illumina exome chip, of
which 348 samples came from the Singapore Integrative Omics
Project (iOmics) and 12022 samples came from multiple complex
disease studies that are being carried out at the Genome Institute
of Singapore.

To compare the performance of different genotype calling
algorithms, we need to derive a set of gold standard calls that
we subsequently assumed to be perfect for benchmarking the
genotype calls made by different algorithms. Of the 348 iOmics
samples, 81 samples have been additionally whole-genome
sequenced to a target coverage of 30—fold as part of the
Singapore Sequencing Studies (http://www.statgen.nus.edu.sg/),
and the sequence calls after quality checks for these samples
were regarded as the gold standard calls that were subsequently
used to benchmark the performance of the different methods.
A total of 16428 SNPs were present on the exome chip that
overlapped with the polymorphic variants identiﬁed from the
high-coverage sequencing. These SNPs were classiﬁed as
common (MAF35%, 13542 SNPs), low frequency
(1%5MAF<5%, 1356 SNPs) and rare (MAF<1%, 1530
SNPs) according to the GenCall genotypes for all 12370
samples.

To evaluate how the number of samples available for joint
calling impacts the algorithms, we thinned the dataset into four
smaller sets with 500, 1000, 3000 and 5000 samples, which always
included the 81 samples with gold standard calls. Note that
GenCall genotypes were available for the 348 iOmics samples

and 12022 samples independently, and GenoSNP is a single-
sample caller where the performance is not affected by the size
of the available samples.

The performance of iCall, GenCall, optiCall, illuminus and
GenoSNP is evaluated using five metrics: (i) call rate, deﬁned
as the percentage of valid genotype calls that are not assigned as
NULL; (ii) concordance, deﬁned as the percentage of valid geno-
type calls that are identical to the gold standard calls; (iii) overall
concordance, defined as the percentage of genotype calls out of
all possible calls that are identical to the gold standard calls, and
is calculated as the product of the call rate and the concordance;
(iv) minor allele concordance for rare and low-frequency SNPs,
deﬁned as the percentage of the heterozygous and minor allele-
homozygous calls that are identical to the gold standard calls out
of the total number of such calls made for these SNPs; and
(V) missed minor allele call rate, deﬁned as the percentage of
the heterozygous and minor-allele homozygous calls that are
not identiﬁed out of the total number of available minor allele
calls in the gold standard. The last two metrics effectively evalu-
ate the true-positive and false-negative rates for making a
genotype call involving at least one minor allele at a rare or
low-frequency SNP. The calculations of all ﬁve metrics are
made using only the 81 samples for which there are gold stand-
ard calls available.

On the basis of call rates and concordance with the gold stand-
ard calls, iCall yielded the highest overall concordance rate and
call rate regardless of the sample size (Table 1). We observed that
GenCall yielded the highest concordance rate but tend to be
more conservative at making calls, but still managed to deliver
an overall concordance rate that was consistently higher than the
performance by optiCall. The performance of illuminus and
GenoSNP were comparatively less satisfactory, with GenoSNP
yielding an overall concordance rate that was below 97%.

When evaluating the ability to correctly call genotypes carry-
ing at least one copy of the minor allele that is present in the
dataset at a frequency <5%, iCall consistently yields the highest
accuracy and the lowest missed allele calls compared with
GenCall, optiCall, illuminus and GenoSNP at low-frequency
SNPs (Table 1). For example, iCall achieved a minor allele con-
cordance rate of 97.140 and 97.168% at the sample sizes of 500
and 12 370, respectively, compared with optiCall at 96.932 and
97.033%, respectively, and the next-best performing algorithm
(GenCall) at 97.083% on the basis of 348 samples. At rare SNPs,
iCall similarly delivered the highest minor allele concordance
rates across all sample sizes considered (at least 97.435%, with
all other methods delivering concordance <97%). This suggests
that whenever iCall made a call involving a minor allele, it was
more likely to be correct than existing algorithms.

However, a high minor allele concordance can be achieved by
a conservative algorithm that only calls the easy-to-call minor
allele genotypes but misses out on most of the genuine minor
allele calls. We additionally evaluated the extent that each caller
is missing genuine minor allele calls. For low-frequency SNPs,
iCall consistently exhibited the lowest missed minor allele call
rate (with a maximum of 2.915%), compared with 2.958% for
GenCall and 3.029% for optiCall with 12 370 samples. However,
for rare SNPs, iCall was more conservative and made less minor
allele genotype calls than optiCall, especially when the sample
size is large (missed minor allele call rate of 3.280 and 2.967% for

Among the 16428 SNPs considered, 13 542 are common SNPs, 1356 are low—frequency SNPs and 1530 are rare SNPs. Within the gold standard, there are 1222885 valid
genotype calls in total, which include 14063 minor allele calls at low—frequency SNPs and 6371 minor allele calls at rare SNPs.

iCall and optiCall, respectively) although the genotype calls by
iCall are much more likely to be correct (concordance of
97.546% by iCall versus 94.166% by optiCall). As the number
of samples available for joint calling increases, optiCall appears
to be more liberal at making minor allele calls, whereas iCall
appears to be stable. GenCall, illuminus and GenoSNP consist-
ently performed poorly when measured with these two minor
allele metrics.

zCall is a post-processing caller that uses intensities and geno-
types generated from a stand-alone caller as input data. We also
compared the performance of GenCall+zCall, optiCall+zCall
and iCall+zCall (Table 2). The results indicated that zCall
always improved the genotype calls generated from all the
three callers, with the greatest degree of improvement observed
for GenCall genotypes. Across all SNPs, GenCall+zCall yielded
marginally higher overall concordance rates (97.684 and
97.683% at sample sizes of 500 and 12 370, respectively) com-
pared with those by iCall+zCall (97.681 and 97.683%, respect-
ively). However, at low-frequency and rare SNPs, iCall+zCall
outperformed GenCall+zCall, delivering higher concordance
rates and lower missed call rates for minor allele genotypes.
optiCall+zCall exhibited the same characteristics as optiCall,
where it is more aggressive in calling minor allele genotypes
but at the expense of making more erroneous calls.

4 DISCUSSION

We have introduced iCall, a method for calling genotypes that
yields comparatively better performance than existing genotype
calling algorithms, particularly in accurately calling the geno-
types involving minor alleles at low-frequency or rare SNPs.
One important aspect of genotype calling is that determining
the genotypes accurately is straightforward for the majority of
the SNPs, but there are SNPs where the MAF are considerably
lower or when the hybridization profiles differ from the usual
that require more robust considerations to accurately determine
the genotypes. Our method improves on the framework of illu-
minus by using a series of penalty functions to identify the opti-
mum parameters to seed the EM model. The availability of a
large dataset that has been genotyped on the exome chip meant
that we can evaluate the performance of existing algorithms
across different sample sizes.

We have benchmarked the genotype calls obtained from dif-
ferent methods against a set of gold standard calls that was
derived from deep sequencing. As a stand-alone caller, iCall per-
forms the best in terms of delivering the most accurate genotype
calls while minimizing the number of missed calls, particularly
for genotypes involving minor alleles at low-frequency and rare
SNPs. The better performance at low-frequency and rare SNPs

Among the 16 428 SNPs, 13 542 are common SNPs, 1356 are low—frequency SNPs and 1530 are rare SNPs. Within the gold standard, there are 1 222 885 valid genotype calls in

was similarly observed when iCall was incorporated as part of a
two-stage calling process with zCall.

We have compared iCall against existing methods using two
additional metrics that speciﬁcally focused on the ability to call
the genotypes that involved at least one minor allele at rare and
low-frequency SNPs. This is in line with the intended purpose of
the exome microarray for finding low-frequency or rare SNPs
that are associated with phenotypes. Measuring how accurately
and sensitively a calling algorithm can call a heterozygous or
minor allele-homozygous genotype is thus more important.
After all, an algorithm that erroneously calls a rare SNP as
major-allele monomorphic will have attained a concordance of
at least 98%. In quantifying the association evidence at rare or
low-frequency SNPs, it is common to pool allele counts across
similar SNPs in a genomic region to assess allelic burden (Ionita-
Laza et al., 2013; Neale et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2010, 2011).
Erroneously calling the presence of a minor allele genotype, or
the failure to call a minor allele genotype when it exists can thus
directly impact the power and false-positive rate of the associ-
ation analyses.

Automated algorithms for calling genotypes have contributed
to the success of large-scale genomic studies, and this is likely to
continue with the continuous introduction of next-generation
genotyping microarrays designed with knowledge gained from
large-scale sequencing studies, querying up to 5 million SNPs

across the genome or variants found speciﬁcally in the exons.
Although these technologies provide the opportunity to investi-
gate new hypotheses on the evolution of the human genome and
the genetic etiology of diseases and traits, this can only happen if
the content in the human genome can be accurately determined.
We have introduced a calling algorithm that provides a better
ability at accurately calling genotypes for rare and low-frequency
SNPs, and consistently performs well at common SNPs.

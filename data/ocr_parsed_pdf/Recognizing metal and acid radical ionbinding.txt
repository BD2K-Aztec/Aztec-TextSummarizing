Abstract

Motivation: More than half of proteins require binding of metal and acid radical ions for their struc—
ture and function. Identification of the ion—binding locations is important for understanding the
biological functions of proteins. Due to the small size and high versatility of the metal and acid rad—
ical ions, however, computational prediction of their binding sites remains difficult.

Results: We proposed a new ligand—specific approach devoted to the binding site prediction of 13
metal ions (Zn2+, Cu“, Fe“, Fe“, Ca“, Mg“, Mn“, Na+, Kr) and acid radical ion ligands (C0322
N022 8042’, PO43’) that are most frequently seen in protein databases. A sequence—based
ab initio model is first trained on sequence profiles, where a modified AdaBoost algorithm is ex—
tended to balance binding and non—binding residue samples. A composite method lonCom is then
developed to combine the ab initio model with multiple threading alignments for further improving
the robustness of the binding site predictions. The pipeline was tested using 5—fold cross valid—
ations on a comprehensive set of 2,100 non—redundant proteins bound with 3,075 small ion ligands.
Significant advantage was demonstrated compared with the state of the art ligand—binding meth—
ods including COACH and TargetS for high—accuracy ion—binding site identification. Detailed data
analyses show that the major advantage of lonCom lies at the integration of complementary ab ini-
tio and template—based components. Ion—specific feature design and binding library selection also
contribute to the improvement of small ion ligand binding predictions.

function for carrying and transferring oxygen through blood, a fun—
damental life process of all vertebrates (except for the fish family
channichthyidae) and some of invertebrates (Hsia, 1998); the bind—
ing of metal Zn2+ ions with nucleases and transcription factors plays
a critical structural role in the formation of Zn finger domains for
the receptor proteins to recognize DNA and RNA molecules and to
up— or down—regulate the expression of specific genes (Berg, 1990).
Therefore, accurate identification of the protein—ion—binding sites is
important for understanding the mechanism of protein function and
for new drug discovery.

Many computational methods have been proposed in the last
two decades for predicting general ligand—protein binding sites,
which can be roughly grouped into two categories of sequence—
based (Capra and Singh, 2007; Chen et al., 2014, 2016; Magliery
and Regan, 2005; Rausell et al., 2010) and structure—based
(Brylinski and Skolnick, 2008; Capra et al., 2009; Hendlich et al.,
1997; Laskowski, 1995; Roche et al., 2011; Roy et al., 2012; Roy
and Zhang, 2012; Wass et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2013b)
approaches. The sequence—based methods mostly rely on residue
conservation analyses under the assumption that ligand—binding resi—
dues are functionally important and therefore should be conserved
in the evolution. Although the sequence—based approaches have the
advantage in generating binding—site prediction from sequence
alone, the precision of the predictions is generally low as many non—
binding residues are often conserved due to the diverse roles such as
maintaining a stable structural fold. The structure—based approaches
are designed to predict the ligand binding sites either from structure
alone (e.g. by the identification of ‘pocket’ or ‘cavity’ on the surface
of protein structure) (Capra et al., 2009), or from structure—based
template comparison and transferal (Brylinski and Skolnick, 2008;
Roy and Zhang, 2012). More recently, a consensus—based approach,
COACH (Yang et al., 2013b), was proposed to combine multiple
structure—based methods, which demonstrated considerable advan—
tage over individual component predictors.

Despite the success, most of the above ligand—binding modeling
methods have been designed for the ligands of medium—to—large size
and are not optimal for small ligand prediction, such as for metal
and acid radical ions. Due to their small size, the interactions of the
small ions with proteins are often found significantly more versatile
and ﬂexible compared with larger size ligands (Chakrabarti, 1993;
Yamashita et al., 1990). In particular, many of the current ligand—
binding prediction methods were developed using generic training
approaches built on all ligands without carefully discriminating dif—
ferent physicochemical characteristics for different types of ligand
molecules. Binding sites usually differ chemically and structurally in
different categories. The recent community—wide ligand—binding ex—
periments in CASP have suggested the advantage of evaluation on
the basis of chemo—type categories of ligand—binding (Schmidt et al.,
2011). An optimal training based on ligand—specific feature selec—
tions should help improve the small ion binding recognitions.

In this work, we aim to develop new algorithms devoted specific—
ally to the recognition of small ligand binding sites. Ligand—specific
features will be designed, with a focus on the thirteen metal and acid
radical ions that have been most frequently seen in the ligand—
binding databases and proven to be important to various protein
functions. To systematically examine the strengths and weaknesses
of the approach, large—scale benchmark tests will be conducted on a
comprehensive dataset containing all non—redundant ion—protein
binding interactions from the PDB, which will be compared with the
state of the art methods from both generic and ligand—specific bind—
ing prediction approaches.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Dataset

This study focuses on the prediction of binding sites by thirteen
small ions ligands that are most frequently seen in literature and the
protein—binding databases, containing nine metal ligands (ZnZT,
Cu“, Fe“, Fe“, Ca2+, Mg“, Mn“, NaT, KT) and four acid rad—
ical ligands (C0327, N027, S0427, P0437). To benchmark the
binding site prediction methods, we collected a comprehensive non—
redundant set of ion—binding proteins from the BioLiP database
(Yang et al., 2013a), which have a pairwise sequence identity below
30%, all with a length above 50 residues.

This set contains 2100 protein entries bound with 3075 ion mol—
ecules, where 1374 proteins are with the metal ions and 726 with
the acid radical ions. There are overall 12 047 residues involved in
the ion binding, with 4.2 residues per ion on average (4.1 residues
per metal ion and 4.4 residues per acid radical ion). This is signifi—
cantly smaller than the average number of residues (10.2) bound
with other ligands in BioLiP. The detailed composition of the data—
set for different ion ligands is summarized in Table 1.

2.2 lonSeq

2.2.1 Method outline

We first present a sequence—based ab initio prediction method,
named IonSeq, which only uses information from protein sequence
(Fig. 1A). For a target residue in a protein sequence, the local se—
quence, with a sliding window (widtth) centered at the target
residue, is used to extract multiple features containing position spe—
cific conservation scores and ligand—specific binding propensities.
The target residue is then represented as a feature vector for the ion—
binding training. Since the number of binding residues is far lower
than that of the non—binding residues in the training dataset, a modi—
fied AdaBoost algorithm is proposed to construct a set of multiple
training datasets to address the class imbalance issue. One predic—
tion model is constructed for each dataset using support vector ma—
chine (SVM), and a united model is finally created by the ensemble
classifier through the integration of the output of all different
models.

For a given protein sequence, the classifier outputs the probabil—
ities for each residue to be an ion—binding residue. The binding sites
are predicted in ligand—specific manner, i.e. one classifier is con—
structed for each specific ligand. A flowchart of IonSeq is outlined in
Figure 1A, with the details of feature design and training algorithms
explained below.

2.2.2 Feature design

Features used in IonSeq can be categorized into the four groups, i.e.
position specific score matrix (PSSM), local structure properties,
position and segment specific conservation scores, and ligand—
specific binding propensities.

(1) PSSM. Starting from the query sequence, a multiple sequence
alignment (MSA) of homologous proteins is constructed by PSI—BLAST
(Altschul et al., 1997) searching through the NCBI non—redundant
sequence dataset (NR) with the E—value threshold of 0.001 and three it—
erations. The training feature (y) is then extracted from the logistic
transformation of the PSSM scores (x) by

1

:W- ‘1)

y
The width of the sliding window, L, which is used to calculate the
PSSM values, is a parameter to optimize during cross—validation.
Due to the distinction of different ligands, each ligand has its own
optimal window width; thus the number of dimension of the PSSM
feature is L"'20. Here, we also tried a few other options for MSA
constructions, including Pfam and HHblits; but no improvement
was found compared with PSI—BLAST.

(2) Local structure properties. Three types of local structure fea—
tures are derived from the query sequence. First, the secondary struc—
ture is predicted by PSSpred (Yan et al., 2013), where a three—
dimensional Boolean vector is used to label the secondary structure
type (alpha—helix, beta—strand and coil). The relative solvent accessi—
bility (RSA) is predicted by the SOLVE program (Yang et al., 2015),
with only one Boolean value illustrating whether the residue is
buried (RSA < 25%) or exposed (RSA > 25%). The backbone tor—
sion angles are predicted by ANGLOR (Wu and Zhang, 2008) and
2D real value is used to specify the (p/i/I dihedral angles. Considering
the local window size L, the number of dimension of the predicted
local structure properties is L"'6.

(3) Position and segment specific conservation scores. Since ion—
binding residues tend to be more conserved than others in evolution,
two conservation scores are considered in IonSeq, to enhance the
complementarity of the conservation information. Both scores are
built on the PSI—BLAST MSA. The first is residue position—specific
and scaled by the relative entropy (RE) and Jensen—Shannon diver—
gence (JSD) (Lin, 1991). Following Capra and Singh (Capra and

Singh, 2007), the RE and JSD scores are calculated by (Yang et al.,
2013b):

 

RE.- : Edema-(4)108 
Pi(a) 1M“) (2)
ED : 42.1644174601ng + <1 — A)Za644”i(“’l°g%

where pi(a) is the probability of amino acid a at the ith position of the
MSA weighted by the Henikoff scheme (Henikoff and Henikoff,
1994), b(a) is the background frequency of a, c,- is a frequency vector
defined by c,- : 2p,- + (1 — Mb, with 220.5 (Capra and Singh, 2007).
The second conservation score is segment—specific, which counts
for the sequence segment of the entire sliding window. To calculate
the segment conservation score, we first count the occurrence fre—
quency of each residue at the specific position of the local window by

7 nm + x/Ni/21

Pm —  (3)

where nm is the occurrence number of residue a at position i of
MSA, N,- is the number of all residues at the position i, a runs for 20
different amino acids plus a virtual residue for the unknown residue
or the residue outside of the sequence, and x/N/21 is the pseudo—
count to offset the deficit in statistics. The relative frequency matrix
is then calculated by

P4
b (a)

where b(a) is the background frequency as defined in Equation (2).

mm : log (4)

The segment conservation score is finally calculated as a normalized
sum of the relative frequency element along all residues in the sliding
window, i.e.

7  (mm, _ mi,min)

Sse — (5)
g  (minim: _ mi,min)

where mismin and mismax are the minimum and maximum value, re—
spectively, at the ith position of MSA.

(4) Ligand-speciﬁc binding propensity. Different ligands tend to
bind to different amino acids. To recall the binding tendency, in
Figure 2 (or Supplementary Fig. S1) we calculated the relative fre—
quency of different amino acids that are bound to four (or all thirteen)
different ions based on the protein—ligand complex structure data from
the BioLiP library (Yang et al., 2013a), where the frequency of the non—
binding residues from the same set of proteins is shown as a control.

As expected, there are some ﬂuctuations in the distribution of
the background non—binding amino acids. However, the variations
of the binding amino acids are much larger, demonstrating the bind—
ing propensity of different ions for different amino acids. For in—
stance, four amino acids of H (HIS), C (CYS), D (ASP) and E (GLU)
stand out to have a much higher binding frequency for metal ion
Zn2+ than other amino acids, while the top four binding residues for
Ca2+ are D (ASP), E (GLU), N (ASN) and G (GLY). On average, the
metal ions tend to bind more frequently with D (ASP), E (GLU) and
H (HIS) residues, while the acid radical ions tend to bind with H
(HIS) and R (ARG) residues.

To account for the ion—specific binding tendency as shown in
Figure 2, we define the propensity of amino acid a for binding the

for all 13 ions are listed in Supplementary Figure 81. Data are collected from
the BioLiP database

where P513 is the frequency of a at the binding site of I, and PAN is
the frequency of a in non—binding site region of I. Again, a sliding
window with width L is used to calculate the feature vector based
on Equation (6). Here, we note that to eliminate over—fitting, the
propensity feature was calculated from all the protein—ion complexes
in BioLiP that are not included in the benchmark set listed in
Table 1.

In summary, given a window size L, there are overall 29 *L+ 1
features used in training IonSeq models, which are summarized in
Supplementary Table S1. These features all have a positive impact to
the overall binding site predictions when tested one by one. We also
explored several physical chemical properties, including hydropho—
bicity, hydrophilicity, polarity, polarizability and average accessible
surface area of amino acids. However, the experimental results
showed that these features negatively impact the prediction accuracy
(Supplementary Table S2) and therefore are not included in the final
model.

2.2.3 SVM training with modified AdaBoost algorithm

Given the features designed, we use the SVM as the base classifier to
predict the ion—binding sites, where the LibSVM package (Chang
and Lin, 201 1) is used to conduct SVM training with the radial basic
function selected as the kernel. The parameter A in kernel function
and the regularization parameter C are chosen on the cross—
validation.

As different training parameters can result in various perform—
ances, an ensemble classifier has been proposed for improving the
efficiency of individual classifiers (Dietterich, 2001). The basic
idea of the ensemble classifier is to train multiple base classifiers,
which are then combined to create a more robust and accurate
class label. The AdaBoost algorithm (Freund and Schapire, 1997)
is one of the widely used ensemble classifier methods, which trains
a series of base classifiers by randomly selecting samples from the
training dataset. At each round, the misclassified samples are as—
signed with an enhanced weight so that training in the subsequent
rounds concentrates on the samples that have not been correctly
learnt. The final output of the testing sample is the weighted votes
of the base classifiers. Although the individual classifiers can be
weak, as long as the performance of each classifier is slightly

better than random guessing, the final model by AdaBoost can be
proven to converge to a strong learner (Freund and Schapire,
1997i

In the ion—binding prediction, the number of binding site resi—
dues is far lower than that of non—binding site residues (see
Table 1), which can result in a serious issue of class imbalance, as
the ensemble training can be dominated by the negative samples.
To address this issue, as well as to alleviate the over—fitting prob—
lem from which most ensemble—training methods have suffered,
we implement a modified version of AdaBoost. First, the random
sample selection is performed only on the negative samples (non—
binding residues) while all positive samples are used at each round.
Second, to prevent over—fitting and make full use of the negative
samples, the weight of the misclassified negative samples increase
at a small scale. The overall process of the modified AdaBoost is
outlined in Algorithm 1.

2.3 IonCom

2.3.1 Motivation and method outline

Template—based methods (TBMs) use homologous proteins with
known ligand binding sites to infer the binding residues of the target
sequence (Brylinski and Skolnick, 2008; Roy and Zhang, 2012;
Yang et al., 2013b). The basic assumption behind these methods is
that the evolutionary—related homologous proteins have similar
function and similar binding interactions. TBMs have attracted con—
siderable attention and shown impressive performance in recent
CASP experiments (Schmidt et al., 2011). However the similarity
level between the target and template sequences can affect the

9103 ‘01; isanV uo salaﬁuv soc} ‘BtHJOJtIBQ JO AJtSJQAtuf] 112 /310'sleumoip1q1xo'sopeurJOJutotq/ﬁduq 11101} papeolumoq

accuracy of the TBMs. Especially, there are no close homologous
templates for the ‘hard’ proteins and TBMs will fail for these kinds
of proteins lacking homologous templates. In contrast, the
sequence—based (or template—free) methods are more robust in the—
ory because they only use sequence information, although the per—
formance of the template—free methods is less accurate than the
TBMs when homologous templates can be identified.

Based on these observations, we propose a composite method,
named IonCom, which combines BMs recently developed, including
COFACTOR (Roy et al., 2012), TM—SITE, S—SITE and
COACH (Yang et al., 2013b). A flowchart of IonCom is depicted in
Figure 113.

2.3.2 Template-based component predictors

COFACTOR is a structure—based method that uses global structural
alignment, TM—align (Zhang and Skolnick, 2005), to identify prob—
able binding templates and then adopts local 3D motif matches to
derive the binding—site residues. TM—SITE identifies the binding tem—
plates based on the match of substructures that runs from the first
binding residue to the last binding residue (called SSFL) between the
query and template proteins. S—SITE uses the binding site—specific
profile—profile comparisons to detect the templates and ligand bind—
ing sites. Finally, COACH is a consensus—based method that com—
bines the output of the three TBMs. Since both COFACTOR and
TM—SITE use 3D structure of the target proteins, the I—TASSER
method (Yang et al., 2015) is used to generate structure models for
the predictors. To give an unbiased comparison with the sequence—
based methods, all the templates that have a sequence identity
higher than 30% to the query or detectable by PSI—BLAST with an
E—value < 0.05 are excluded from the I—TASSER structure template
library. Meanwhile, the same cutoff is applied to exclude the bind—
ing templates from the BioLiP library when implementing the TBMs
for binding site transferal, to eliminate contamination from homolo—
gous functional templates.

2.3.3 Feature collection and ligand-specific training

The combination of the binding site predictions from IonSeq,
COFACTOR, TM—SITE, S—SITE and COACH is conducted by the
same SVM program with the modified AdaBoost implementation as
described in the last section (Fig. 1B). The training features contain
the probability output from IonSeq and the confidence scores ex—
tracted from the four template—based predictors. The template—based
confidence scores combined the C—score of I—TASSER structure pre—
dictions, sequence and structure similarities of the functional tem—
plates to the query proteins, binding pocket similarity, and the
cluster density of the binding sites on the surface of the I—TASSER
models (Yang et al., 2013b). For each residue, a local window of
width L is used to extract the combined feature vectors.

The IonCom prediction is trained in a ligand—specific manner.
For IonSeq, the binding—site prediction has been trained specifically
on different ligand families. For the general—purpose template—based
predictors, the binding sites and the ligand identities are first ex—
tracted from the homologous templates. If one of the ligands
matches with the specific ligand, the binding site is selected as a can—
didate. Such approach works better than the treatment that only
uses the most possible ligand (data not shown). The IonCom is then
trained on different ligands separately.

In Supplementary Table S3, we summarize the optimized value
of all training parameters that have been used in both IonSeq and
IonCom developments.

2.4 Evaluation metrics
Four metrics are used to evaluate the proposed methods, including

accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Matthew correlation coeffi—
cient (MCC), which are defined as:

TP+TN

ACCWY : m ‘7)
. . . TP

Sen51t1v1ty — T71) + FN (8)

Spec1f1c1ty — TN—+FP (9)

MCC: TPXTN—FPXFN (10)
\/(TP + FP)(TP + FN)(TN + FP)(TN + FN)

 

where TP is the number of binding residues correctly predicted as
binding residues, TN is the number of non—binding residues cor—
rectly predicted as non—binding residues, FF is the number of non—
binding residues incorrectly predicted as binding residues, and EN is
the number of binding residues incorrectly predicted as non—binding
residues.

3 Results and discussions

3.1 Results of sequence—based method

The proposed sequence—based method (IonSeq) is evaluated by a
5—fold cross—validation experiment. For each ion ligand, the dataset
is randomly divided into five parts, where four parts are used to
train the IonSeq model and the remaining part for testing the model.
This process is repeated five times and the average performance on
testing over the five parts is reported as the final cross—validation re—
sults. Since the S—SITE method does not use 3D structure informa—
tion (Yang et al., 2013b), we will control the IonSeq predictions
with the S—SITE results that are based on the same set of testing pro—
teins (Table 2).

As shown in Table 2, the optimal window size for different ion
ligands is different for IonSeq. The size of the binding pocket is gen—
erally proportional to the volume of the binding ligand, so the local
neighbor information used to predict the binding residues might also
be changed with the size of the binding ligand. IonSeq can make ac—
curate prediction for most of the ligands with a high accuracy and
specificity. Despite this, the sensitivity of IonSeq is lower than S—
SITE in 8 of the 13 cases, in which we found that good templates
were identified by S—SITE for most of the cases. Nevertheless, the
MCC values of IonSeq, which measure the combination of sensitiv—
ities and specificities of the predictions, are higher than S—SITE for
almost all metal and acid radical ions except for the Mg2+ligand.
The difference is statistically significant for all ions that have a p—
value of Student’s t—test below 5 X 1077.

Despite the success, the overall MCC values by IonSeq are still
low for the ions of Ca2+, MgZT, NaT, KT, C0327, and S0427, due
to the relatively low coverage of the prediction. Statistically, the low
coverage should stem from the relatively lower binding frequency of
these ions in the native structure compared with other ions (Yu
et al., 2013). This data also highlight the limit of the sequence—based
training methods, the performance of which depends on the charac—
teristics of the training data samples.

There are overall four types of features that have been used by
IonSeq: PSSM, local structure properties, position and segment spe—
cific conservation scores, and ligand—specific binding propensity. To
examine and assess the relative contribution of different features, we

retrained the IonSeq program on each of the individual feature
types. Meanwhile, we also trained IonSeq with the cumulative fea—
tures, in which individual features are gradually added to the feature
that has the highest MCC. The results are summarized in
Supplementary Figure S2. It is shown that among the different indi—
vidual feature types, the conservation score achieves the highest
MCC for all ligands while the local structure property has the lowest
MCC. The order of the performance by the PSSM and propensity
feature varies for different ligands. When the features are added to
IonSeq one by one, the MCC by IonSeq keeps increasing, although
the increase speed differs for different ligands. This data suggest that
different features contain components complementary to each other
and a full feature set is needed to train the predictors to achieve the
optimal prediction results.

3.2 Overall results of composite predictions
To get more reliable binding site predictions, IonCom was designed
to combine the output of the template—free method and TBMs
(Fig. 1B). Among the TBMs, COACH is a consensus approach
shown to outperform all the individual TBMs in the former large—
scale benchmark tests (Yang et al., 2013b). COACH also signifi—
cantly outperforms the peer methods in the community—wide
CAMEO (Continuous Automated Model EvaluatiOn) experiment
(Haas et al., 2013) (see http://www.cameo3d.org/lb/1—year/). Thus,
we will mainly use COACH as a control to examine the IonCom
results.

The average results of the IonCom and COACH are summarized
in Table 3, whereas a detailed list of predictions on the 13 metal and
radical ions is given in Supplementary Table S4. The data show that

 

IonCom outperforms COACH on all the ion ligands with an average
MCC value increased by 5.84%.

In Figure 3, we present a head—to—head comparison of IonCom
with all the individual methods of template—based and sequence—
based methods. To assess the dependence of IonCom and the indi—
vidual methods, a Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) between
them is provided in the figure as well. The maximum correlation
(PCC : 0.93) is observed between IonCom and COACH, indicating
that COACH gives the largest contribution to IonCom, followed by
TM—Site, S—Site, IonSeq and COFACTOR. Despite the high correl—
ation with COACH, there are 802 cases in which IonCom has a
higher MCC value than COACH where COACH has a higher MCC
in 301 cases. Accordingly, IonCom has 815/765/963/936 cases with
a higher MCC over COFACTOR/TM—SITE/S—SITE/IonSeq, respect—
ively, while in 389/350/322/597 cases IonCom is outperformed by
the corresponding methods. This data demonstrates the benefit of
the combination of multiple methods.

Table 4 lists the p—values in the Student’s t—test between the
methods on the ion—binding site predictions. The data show that the
P—values between IonCom and the individual methods are all below
10710, indicating the improvement is statistically significant.

Figure 4 present two illustrative examples showing the recogni—
tion of metal and acid radical ion—binding sites by IonCom. The first
is from the DNA polymerase beta protein (PDB ID: 3BOX) interact—
ing with two Zn“ ions. The number of the native binding residues
defined by BioLiP is six, where IonCom correctly recognized five of
them (red color in Fig. 4A). The two false positive residues are very
close to the ligands, which may have weak binding to the ligands
(magenta color in Fig. 4A).

The second example is from the tryptophan synthase alpha pro—
tein (PDB ID: 1XC4) that interacts with acid radical SO42. Among
the five native binding residues defined by BioLiP, IonCom correctly

identify four. There is one falsely predicted residue that is located
quite far away from the ligand; but this reside is still on the surface
of the protein (Fig. 4B). None of these binding sites were recognized
by the COACH prediction (data not shown).

3.3 Sequence—based method is a complement of
structure—based method

The improvement made by IonCom on COACH mainly benefits
from the introduction of the template—free ab initio component,
IonSeq, which is complementary to the template—based features used
in COACH. The effect of the sequence—based features on the binding
site prediction can be most clearly seen on the protein targets that
have no close homologous templates.

In Supplementary Table S5, we summarize the results for the pro—
teins that the threading program LOMETS considers as hard targets,
i.e. the Z—score of the threading alignments between the target se—
quence and the structure templates in the PDB is below the confidence
score cutoffs (Wu and Zhang, 2007). As expected, the performance of
binding predictions becomes poorer for most of these hard proteins.
Among the non—combination based method, the sequence—based
methods (IonSeq and S—SITE) significantly outperform the structure—
based methods (COFACT OR and TM—SITE). In most cases, the

dicted and the common binding residues are shown in blue, magenta and red

structure—based methods cannot identify any binding sites. In com—
parison, IonSeq provides good complementarity for Zn“, Nair and
PO43" ions and S—SITE provides good complementarity for Cu“ and
Mn“ ions. These results demonstrate that the sequence—based
approaches can serve as an effective complement to the structure—
based methods when no homologous templates are available.

IonCom also significantly outperforms IonSeq due to the com—
plementarity of template—based features to the sequence—based fea—
tures. In particular, the MCC value is significantly improved on the
ligands, Ca“, Mg“and SO42} which IonSeq considered as hard
targets according to the data in Table 2, with the average MCC
increased by 49%. However, the MCC improvement on NaT,
K4r and CO3“ is modest by IonCom compared with (or even worse
than) IonSeq, indicating that the structure— and TBMs are less effi—
cient for these ions, probably due to the high variation of Na+,
KT and CO3“ binding even among the homologous proteins
(Yamashita et al., 1990).

3.4 Ligand—specific feature selections help improve pre—

diction performance

IonSeq is a ligand—specific method that trains models for different
ligands, while the COFACTOR and COACH programs are general—
purpose methods that use one model for different ligands. To get an
unbiased examination on the efficiency of these two types of
approaches, we randomly selected 20% of proteins for each ion lig—
and, which are merged into one single dataset. We then re—trained
the IonSeq model on this single dataset using the same features, but
one with a ligand—specific approach (labeled as ‘IonSeq_specific’)
and the other with a general—purpose approach (‘IonSeq_general’) in
which the positive samples are defined as the binding residues re—
gardless of the ion type that the residues bind to, and the negative
samples are the non—binding residues.

Supplementary Table S6 summarizes the data of IonSeq_specific
and IonSeq_general based on the 5—fold cross validations. It is
observed that IonSeq_specific outperforms IonSeq_general for most
ion ligands, with the average MCC value increased by 20%. Here,
the reason for us to have reduced the sample size (to 20%) is that
the total number of protein samples from the 13 ions is too big for
the general—purpose training. Despite the sample size reduction, the
overall performance of IonSeq_Specific is not changed much in com—
parison with the full—version IonSeq results (see Table 2). This shows
the robustness of the IonSeq data training and cross validation that
are not sensitive to the sample size.

Interestingly, the ligand—specific mode does not outperform the
general—purpose mode on ligand Mg“, KT, CO3“ and N027. One
possible reason may be that the receptor proteins may bind with
multiple ligands except for the target ions; therefore, the ligand—

9103 ‘01; isanV uo salaﬁuv soc} ‘BtHJOJtIBQ JO AJtSJQAtuf] 112 /310'sleumoip1q1xo'sopeurJOJutotq/ﬁduq 11101} papeolumoq

X.Hu et al.

 

specific training can reduce the accuracy due to the alternative bind—
ing sites. To examine the possibility, we count for the ratio of the
number of the target binding sites divided by the number of all bind—
ing sites on the receptor proteins. The binding site ratio for the pro—
teins associated with these four ion ligands are all lower than 0.58,
which means that these proteins have more than 42% alternative
binding sites interacting with other ligands (the binding site ratio for
other ions is generally lower than these four ions). Such variations
on non—specific binding can give some level of favor to the general—
purpose training methods.

3.5 Comparison with other ligand—specific methods

The above controls are mainly focused on the comparison of the
proposed methods with the template—based modeling methods
developed in our own lab. To have a more general control with
other methods, we examine our methods with TargetS, which is a
ligand—specific method for the binding site prediction recently pro—
posed by Yu et al. (2013). There are five metal ligands in the
TargetS dataset that overlap with this study.

Table 5 presents a comparison of the IonSeq and IonCom results
on the five common ligands with TargetS, where the TargetS predic—
tion was obtained by submitting the protein sequence to the web—
server. The data shows that both IonCom and IonSeq predictions
significantly outperform TargetS on all five metal ions. For example,
the average MCC value by IonSeq is nearly eight times higher than
that by TargetS, the difference of which has a p—value in Student’s

test below 10’1000

in all cases. Although TargetS method can get ac—
ceptable performance on large ligands such as ATP and HEME (Yu
et al., 2013), the accuracy of the binding site predictions on the
small ion ligand is generally low. One reason is that the TargetS
training used a high threshold for ligand binding and spatial cluster—
ing, which eliminated many of positive binding residues and thus
decreased the sensitivity of the predictions.

There are other sequence—based methods that were designed for
generic ligand binding site predictions based on dynamic ensemble
learning, such as LigandRFs (Chen et al., 2014) and LigandDSES
(Chen et al., 2016). In addition to the different feature selection and
training processes, one of the major distinctions of IonSeq, in com—
parison to these generic binding modeling methods, is that IonSeq
focuses on a set of small metal and radical ion ligands, which allows
a ligand—specific training to enhance the specificity and accuracy of
training models.

3.6 Impact of database selection to ion—binding site
prediction

Appropriate definition of ligand binding sites is critical to binding site
prediction methods. Many ligand—binding predictors use protein—
ligand complex structures from the PDB to train and test the models.
However, not all the ligands present in the PDB are biologically rele—
vant (i.e. required due to biological functions), as many small mol—
ecules are used as additives for solving protein structures. In this
study, we employ the dataset from BioLiP (Yang et al., 2013a) to train
the IonSeq and IonCom programs. BioLiP is a newly developed
ligand—protein interaction database that uses a semi—manual process
to filter out biologically irrelevant ligands when merging the complex
data from the PDB and other ligand—binding libraries. The binding
site definition in BioLiP is the same as that used in the CASP experi—
ment (Schmidt et al., 2011), i.e. a binding site is defined if the residue
in the target structure has at least one heavy atom within a distance
dii S ri + r,- + c to the biologically relevant ligand atoms, where r,-
and r,- are the Van der Waals radii of the involved atoms, and c : 0.5
A is the tolerance distance parameter.

Many studies also use the Ligand Protein Contact (LPC) pro—
gram (Sobolev et al., 1999) to define the binding residues, which is
based on automated surface complementarity analyses. To examine
the difference between LPC and BioLiP, we collected the binding
sites of each protein in the ligand—specific dataset by the LPC pro—
gram and the BioLiP database, respectively. The number of binding
residues collected from the two datasets is listed in Supplementary
Table S7, which shows that the difference between LPC and BioLiP
is significant. For example, Zn“ has 632 common binding residues
defined by both, where 65 binding residues are solely defined by
BioLiP and 449 are solely by LPC. The number of binding residues
defined by LPC is much higher than that by BioLiP for most ligands
(expect for Mg“, Na+ and KT that have a slightly higher number of
binding residues by BioLiP). This difference is because BioLiP
focuses on the biologically relevant binding residues that are mainly
collected from the experimental data followed by manual validation.
This process may help filter out false binding residues from auto—
mated geometrical and solvation calculations.

To quantitatively access the impact of the binding site definition
on the performance of binding site predictions, a base—line method
(SVM—PSSM), which uses a PSSM as the only input to train SVM
models, is implemented on the same set of proteins with the ion—
binding sites defined by BioLiP and LPC respectively. As shown in
Table 6, the SVM—PSSM method with the binding sites by BioLiP
achieves considerably better performance than that by LPC, with
the average MCC on the five randomly selected ions improved by
11.8%, which corresponds to the P—value < 10732 in the Student’s

t—test. Since the training feature and methods on the two predictions
are identical, such a difference indicates that the binding sites
defined in LPC are less consistent; therefore, the training on the
same datasets resulted in lower prediction accuracy. This may be
due to the fact that LPC uses an automated procedure to define
binding sites that might have induced artificial and biologically non—
relevant ion binding data.

4 Conclusion

We presented two ligand—specific methods for small ligand binding
site predictions from metal and acid radical ions. The sequence—
based ab initio method (IonSeq) uses only sequence information and
adopts a modified AdaBoost method that was extended to eliminate
the imbalance effect of the data sample that has been dominated by
the non—binding residues. The second method, IonCom, combines
the ab initio and template—based methods to generate composite ion—
binding site predictions.

The two methods were tested on a non—redundant set of the ion
binding proteins extracted from a semi—manually curated ligand—
binding sites database, BioLiP (Yang et al., 2013a). The experimen—
tal results demonstrated the significant improvement of the compos—
ite methods over individual component predictors. The detailed data
analysis shows that the major contributions for the improvement are
due to the complementarity of the component predictors from dif—
ferent prediction principles. Meanwhile, the ligand—specific feature
selection and the AdaBoost training helped improve accuracy of the
sequence—based predictors that are critical for modeling the targets
that lack close homologous templates. Although the generic pre—
dictors with ligand—nonspecific features have on average a lower
MCC, training with the generic feature sections can improve the
binding—site accuracy of some proteins that bind with multiple ion
ligands. Finally, it is found that the training library selection, with a
manually—cleaned and biologically—relevant binding dataset, has fur—
ther impact to enhance the binding site prediction, compared with
the automated, geometry based binding datasets.

Despite the encouraging data results compared with peer meth—
ods, the overall accuracy of the current methods is still low for some
ions with a high binding variability, such as Na+ and KT. There are
also problems for the approaches to identify specific binding loca—
tions when multiple ligands are associated with the same target pro—
teins. Future directions of developments will be to explore more
specific feature selections, e.g. integrating physicochemical features
of the small ion ligands (Yamashita et al., 1990) to increase the spe—
cificity of the binding recognitions. Meanwhile, appropriate selec—
tion and refinement of the negative sample (i.e. non—binding
residues) should also help to increase the binding specificity and re—
duce the noise from non—specific ligand binding.

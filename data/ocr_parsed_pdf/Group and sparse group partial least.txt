Abstract

Motivation: The association between two blocks of ’omics’ data brings challenging issues in com—
putational biology due to their size and complexity. Here, we focus on a class of multivariate statis—
tical methods called partial least square (PLS). Sparse version of PLS (sPLS) operates integration of
two datasets while simultaneously selecting the contributing variables. However, these methods
do not take into account the important structural or group effects due to the relationship between
markers among biological pathways. Hence, considering the predefined groups of markers
(e.g. genesets), this could improve the relevance and the efficacy ofthe PLS approach.

Results: We propose two PLS extensions called group PLS (gPLS) and sparse gPLS (sgPLS). Our al—
gorithm enables to study the relationship between two different types of omics data (e.g. SNP and
gene expression) or between an omics dataset and multivariate phenotypes (e.g. cytokine secre—
tion). We demonstrate the good performance of gPLS and sgPLS compared with the sPLS in the
context of grouped data. Then, these methods are compared through an HIV therapeutic vaccine
trial. Our approaches provide parsimonious models to reveal the relationship between gene abun—
dance and the immunological response to the vaccine.

Availability and implementation: The approach is implemented in a comprehensive R package
called sgPLS available on the CRAN.

1 Introduction

 

Recent advances in high-throughput ‘omics’ technologies enable
quantitative measurements of expression or abundance of biological
molecules of a whole biological system. Various popular ‘omics’
platforms in systems biology include transcriptomics, proteomics,
cytomics and metabolomics. The integration of multi-layer informa-
tion is required to fully unravel the complexities of a biological sys-
tem, as each functional level is hypothesized to be related to
each other (Jayawardana et (11., 2015; Kitano, 2002). Furthermore,

multi-layer information is increasingly available such as in standard
clinical trials. As an example, the evaluation of vaccines in phase I/II
trials incorporates various measurements of the cell counts (tens of
population of interest), of the cell functionality by many ways
including the production of cytokines (intra and extracellular) and
of the gene expression (Palermo et (11., 2011).

The integration of omics data is a challenging task. First, the
high dimensionality of the data, i.e. the large number of measured
biological entities (tens of thousands) makes it very difficult to

obtain a good overview or understanding of the system under study.
The noisy characteristics of such high—throughput data require a fil—
tering process to be able to identify a clear signal. Second, because
of experimental or financial constraints, the small number of sam—
ples or patients (typically < 50) makes the statistical inference diffi—
cult and argue for using the maximum amount of available
information. Third, the integration of heterogeneous data also repre—
sents an analytical and numerical challenge to try to find common
patterns in data from different origins.

In recent years, several statistical integrative approaches have
been proposed in the literature to combine two blocks of omics data,
often in an unsupervised framework. These approaches aim at select—
ing correlated biological entities from two datasets (Chun and Keles,
2010; Le Cao et al., 2008, 2009; Parkhomenko et al., 2009;
Waaijenborg et al., 2008; Witten et al., 2009) or more (Lofstedt
et al., 2014; Tenenhaus and Tenenhaus, 2011). This abundant litera—
ture clearly illustrates that the integrative analysis of two datasets
poses significant statistical challenges to deal with the high dimen—
sionality of the data. In particular, sparse partial least squares (sPLSs),
using a L1 penalty, has been developed for that purpose. With sPLS, it
has been demonstrated that the integrative analysis of large scale
omics datasets could generate new knowledge not accessible by the
analysis of a single data type alone (Lé Cao et al., 2008, 2009).
Moreover, the biological relevance of the approach has been demon—
strated in recent studies (Morine et al., 201 1; Rose et al., 2011).

However, group structures often existing within such data have not
yet been accounted for in these analyses. For example, genes within the
same pathway have similar functions and act together in regulating a
biological system. These genes can add up to have a larger effect and
therefore can be detected as a group [i.e. at a pathway or gene set level
(Tyekucheva et al., 2011)]. This has been increasingly used thank to
geneset enrichment analysis approaches (Subramanian et al., 2005 ).

Considering a group of features instead of individual features
has been found to be effective for biomarker identification (Meier et
al., 2008; Puig et al., 2009; Simon and Tibshirani, 2012; Yuan and
Lin, 2006). Yuan and Lin (2006) proposed group lasso for group
variables selection. Meier et al. (2008) extended it to logistic regres—
sion. Puig et al. (2009) and Simon et al. (2013) modified group lasso
to solve the non—orthonormal matrices problem. Although group
lasso penalty can increase the power for variable selection, it re—
quires a strong group—sparsity (Huang and Zhang, 2010) and cannot
yield sparsity within a group. Ma et al. (2007) proposed a supervised
group lasso which selects both significant gene clusters and signifi—
cant genes within clusters for logistic binary classification and Cox
survival analysis. Simon et al. (2013) proposed a sparse group lasso
penalty by combining an L1 penalty with group lasso to yield spars—
ity at both the group and individual feature level. Zhou (2010)
applied it to genomic feature identification. Garcia et al. (2014) de—
veloped a sparse group—subgroup Lasso to accommodate selecting
important groups, subgroups and individual predictors. In a regres—
sion context with a multivariate response variable, Li et al. (2015)
have recently proposed a multivariate sparse group lasso.

Also some work has been reported to incorporate ‘group effect”
into a conventional canonical correlation analysis (CCA) model.
Chen et al. (2013) studied structure—based CCA and proposed tree—
based and network—based CCA (Chen et al., 2013). Chen and Liu
(2012) incorporated group effect into an association study of nutri—
ent intake with human gut microbiome (Chen and Liu, 2012). Both
papers show an improvement when incorporating group effect;
however, a priori knowledge of group structure is needed and only

the group effect of one type of data is discussed. More recently, Lin
et al. (2013) developed a more general group sparse CCA method,
which have been illustrated on genomics datasets (human gliomas
data and NCI60 data). Witten et al. (2009) proposed a general
penalized matrix decomposition (PMD) approach, which include
sparse principal components and CCA. Sparsity have been realized
by introducing different penalties forms such as L1 penalty or fused
lasso penalty to get smooth results in the context of ordered features.
Based on generalized least square matrix decomposition, Allen et al.
(2014) develop fast computational algorithms for generalized princi—
pal component analysis (PCA) and sparse PCA. In the same idea, a
regularized PLS (RPLS) approach is proposed by Allen et al. (2013)
to take into account the correlations between adjacent variables.
However, none of the PMD and RPLS approaches have introduced
group and sparse group lasso penalty.

Here, we develop in a more general framework a group PLS
(gPLS) method and a sparse gPLS (sgPLS) method (see also Lofstedt
et al. 2014). Both methods focus on sub—matrices decomposition
taking into account the group structures. They could be used in ‘re—
gression’ mode or in ‘canonical mode”. The gPLS model aims at per—
forming selection at group level while sgPLS enables selection at
both group and single feature levels. Both irrelevant groups of fea—
tures and individual features in the remaining groups will be simul—
taneously discarded with sgPLS.

Our article is organized as follows. The model and algorithm for
group and sgPLS are described in Section 2 after introducing the main
steps of sPLS. We also present our extension in a context of PLS dis—
criminant analysis. The performances of our approaches are com—
pared with sPLS via a simulation study in Section 3. This section also
contains an illustration of our method with an HIV vaccine study.
The results are compared with the one obtained by applying the
multivariate sparse group lasso recently proposed by Li et al. (2015 ).

2 Methods

2.1 Notations

Let X and Z be two data matrices containing 11 observations (rows)
of p predictors (gene expression) and q variables (cytokine secre—
tion), respectively. The soft thresholding function is
g5°ﬁ(x,/l) : sign(x)()x) — l)+, where (a)+ : max(a, 0). The
Frobenius norm is denoted  -  1., while the Euclidean vector norm is
l) - ()2 and the L1 vector normis  - 

2.2 PLS and sPLS for integrative analysis

2.2.1 Partial least square

PLS (Wold, 1966) is a well—known exploratory approach that was
initially applied in chemometrics. It is particularly useful for analy—
zing noisy, collinear, even incomplete highly dimensional data; see
Boulesteix and Strimmer (2007) for a review. It performs successive
matrix decompositions of X and Z into new variables (called com—
ponent scores or latent variables), denoted by $1,...,€H for the
X—scores and LL11, . . . ,wH for the Z—scores. These scores should be
few in number (H small) and orthogonal to each other within each
dataset. They are estimated as linear combinations of the original
variables in X and Z, with their weight coefficients stored in the
associated so—called loading vectors u), and Up, 19 : 1,...,H. In a
matrix representation, we have

X::CT+FX, Z:QET+FZ,

where F x and F 2 are the residual matrices and where the (10 + 1)th col—
umns of C and E contain, respectively, the coefficients from the simple
regressions of each column of the current deflated matrices X), : X ),_1
—€),c; and Z), : Z),_1 — cube; onto the score vectors Q,“ and w)“.

PLS relates both matrices by maximizing the covariance between
each pair of scores (5;; : X),_1u),, w), : Z),_1U),):

argmaxHuhHZ:HUhHZ:1 Cov(X),u),,Z),u),), la : 1, . . . ,H. (1)

This PLS form is often referred to as ‘PLS mode A” in the literature
(Vinzi et al., 2010) where, similarly to CCA, the relationship be—
tween the two datasets is symmetric. A variant is an asymmetric
way (‘PLS2’, Wegelin, 2000; Wold et al., 1983) of deflating Z and in
this case the model consequently differs: Z : EDT + F2, where F Z
is a residual matrix and where the (10 + 1)th column in D contains
the coefficients from the local regressions of each column of the cur—
rent deflated matrix Z), : Z),_1 — éhd; onto the score vector é)“.

2.2.2 Sparse PLS

The sPLS enables variable selection from both sets by including L1
penalizations on both u), and U), simultaneously in (1), which is solved
with a Lagrangian form (see Lé Cao et al. 2008, 2009). The result is a
subset of correlated variables from both X and Z indicated through
the non—zero elements of the loading vectors u), and U),, respectively
(for each PLS dimension la) and a set of score vectors (€),,L0),) which
are useful for graphical representations. Let us consider the singular
value decomposition of the r—rank matrix M : XTZ: M : UAVT,
where U: [u1,...,u,] :p X r and V: [U1,...,U,] : q X r are ortho—
normal and where A is a diagonal matrix containing the singular val—
ues 5h. The column vectors of U and V are the PLS loadings of X and
Z. It is worth noting that (u1,u1) is also solution of (1) when 19 : 1.
Moreover, by Eckart—Young’s theorem, these two vectors can also be
obtained by first solving (for it and 17, without a norm constraint) the
minimization problem

followed by a norming step of the vectors found. We thus have

followed by norming 17 (respectively, it). To obtain sPLS loadings,
Lé Cao et al. (2008) followed this idea, similar to the one imple—
mented by Shen and Huang (2008) to develop sparse PCA. In sPLS,
one tries to optimize

using an iterative algorithm (see Supplementary Material) in which at
each iteration, u), (respectively, U),) is alternatively fixed, while 1;), (re—
spectively, u),) is constrained to be of unit—norm and where M), :

are introduced to penalize the loading vectors u), and U),. This proced—
ure leads to normed sparse loading vectors.

2.3 Group PLS and sparse group PLS

2.3.1 Group PLS

Let us consider that both matrices X and Z can be divided, respect—
ively, into K and L sub—matrices (groups) X02) : n X pk and

Z”) : n X 1],, where pk (respectively, q)) is the number of covariates
in group k (respectively, I). For example, for gene expression data,
these sub—matrices may be gene pathways or factor level indicators
in categorical data. The aim is to select only a few groups of X
which are related to a few groups of Z. For each dimension la, fol—
lowing the same idea as in (Yuan and Lin, 2006), we propose to use
group lasso penalties in the optimization problem (2):

K L
P21 (u) = A: \/Z7—kll“(k)llz and P220!) 2 12: Milt/(“112,

where “(I9 (respectively, Um) is the loading vector associated to the
kth (respectively, lth) block. The subscript ), has been removed to im—
prove readability. The minimization criterion (2) can thus be rewrit—
ten as

K
k:

Z{11M(’“ — mm; + warm} + PM”),

where MU“) : X(k)ZT. Therefore, we can optimize over group wise
components of u separately. The first term in the above equation ex—
pands as

tracelM(kii)M(k")Tl — Ztmcelt¢(k)1I-l-M(IZ")T1 + tracelu(k)u(k)Tl.
Hence, the Optimal “(kl minimizes:
tracelu(k)u(k)T] — 2trace[u(k)uTM(k“)T] + ,11\/1TkHu(/¢)H2_

The objective function is convex, so the optimal solution is
characterized by subgradient equations. For group k, “(I9 must satisfy

The iterative procedure for gPLS is similar to that of sPLS. Only the

Material) are modified:

2.3.2 Sparse group PLS

One potential drawback of gPLS is to include a group in the model
when all loadings in that group are non—zero. However, sometimes we
would like to combine both sparsity of groups and within each group.
For example, if the predictor matrix contains genes, we might be inter—
ested in identifying particularly important genes in pathways of inter—
est. To achieve this, in the same spirit as Simon et al. (2013), we
introduce sparse group lasso penalties in the optimization problem (2):

K

mization criterion can be rewritten as

K
Z{11M"” — urn/Tilt + <1 — mummiuwiiz + 112111140111} + PM”)-

Therefore, we can optimize over group wise components of u separ—
ately. Hence, the optimal uUf) minimizes:

trace[u(k)u(k)T] — 2trace[u(k)UTM(k“)T]+

Using similar tools as before, we define the subgradient equations:
—2u(k) + 2M0“); : 11(1 — aim/177.0 + 119.1), (9)
where 0 is the subgradient of (Wk) ()1 evaluated at “((2). So,

where the thresholding function g5°ﬁ(-,/l) is applied to the vector

2.3.3 Remark

Calibration of the different tuning parameters is discussed in the
Supplementary Material.

2.3.4 Extension to discriminant analysis of one dataset

PLSs has often been used for discrimination problems (Nguyen and
Rocke 2002) by recoding the qualitative response as a dummy block
matrix Y : n X g indicating the group of each sample (g being the
number of groups). Barker and Rayens (2003) give some theoretical
justification for this approach. One can also directly apply PLS re—
gression on the data as if Y was a continuous matrix (from now on
called PLS—DA). A sparse version has been proposed by Le Cao et al.
(2011a, b) using the Lagrangian form of PLS—DA to include a L1
constraint. Our algorithm for the gPLS—DA is obtained by replacing
Z with Y and by using only a group penalty on the loading related
to the X matrix (22 : 0 in Equation 3). Algorithm for sgPLS—DA is
also obtained by replacing Z with Y and by using only penalties on

the loading related to the X matrix (22 : 0 and or; : 0 in Equation
3). The tuning parameters (2’17 and 01,17) are calibrated sequentially by
evaluating the classification error rate using leave—one—out or k—folds
cross—validation.

3 Results and discussion

A simulation study is performed to demonstrate the good perform—
ance of gPLS and sgPLS when compared with sPLS. Then, the three
methods are applied on an HIV vaccine evaluation study.

3.1 Simulation study

Different simulation studies are performed to investigate the detec—
tion power of gPLS and sgPLS when group effect exists. We com—
pare the results with the popular sPLS method under several
conditions such as different values of the standard deviation of
noise, the number of groups associated with the multivariate re—
sponses and different sample sizes. We focus on the regression mode
of PLS. For all cases described below, we generated {7:400 vari—
ables stored in the dataset X, which was divided into Gx groups. We
considered two situations for the q variables of dataset Z: (i) q : 10
variables which are not divided into groups and (ii) q:500 vari—
ables which are divided into GZ groups. The link between X and Z
is specified by the following models:

X::CT+FX, Z::DT+FZ,

where the (n X H) matrix E contains H latent variables £1, . . . , £14).
The components of these vectors have all been independently gener—
ated from a standard normal distribution. The rows of the residual
matrix F x (respectively, F 2) have been generated from a multivari—
ate normal distribution with zero mean UX (respectively, HZ) and co—
variance matrix }:X : (71,, (respectively, ZZZ : 0'14). The orthogonal
matrix of regression coefficients C : [C1, . . . ,CH] enables us to
specify the ‘true’ (i.e. active) X—variables linked to the response
[7

Z—variables. The p—vector C) :  ...,c/-

ues 6;: 9E 0 if the corresponding variable X (jth column of X) is a

)T includes non—zero val—

true variable (i.e. associated to one of the latent variables €),) and
zero values otherwise. The matrix orthogonal D : [D1, . . . ,DH] en—
ables us to specify the association of the response variables to each
latent variable. All components of the column vectors D1, . . . ,DH
have been independently generated from a uniform distribution
Ul0.5,2] when the dataset Z is not divided into groups. When the
dataset Z is divided into groups, the column vectors D1, . . . ,DH in—
clude non—zero values d; 9E 0 if the corresponding variable Z/ (jth
column of Z) is a true variable and zero values otherwise. Matrix C
(respectively, D) should be made orthogonal. To understand and
compare the behavior of all methods, we used an optimal value for
tuning parameters. Thus, the sPLS tuning parameter is set to the
number of true variables, and the gPLS and sgPLS tuning parameter
relative to /l is set to the number of active groups. The mixing
parameter or in the sgPLS approach is selected using a 5—folds cross—
validation on a grid of 15 values between 0.05 and 0.95 since it is
not possible to set an optimal value for on

We evaluate the performance of each method by presenting the
true—positive rate (TPR) which reﬂects the number of correctly identi—
fied true variables and the total discordance (TD) which is the number
of incorrectly identified variables. These measures are defined as

TP

TPR:TP+FN’

TD : FP+ FN,

where TP, FF and FN are the number of true positives, false posi—
tives and false negatives, respectively.

3.2 Recovering the signal

The first simulation corresponds to the case when the q : 10 vari—
ables from dataset Z have not been divided into groups. The sample
size is n : 100 and we consider a model with only one latent variable
£1. Dataset X is divided into GX:20 groups of 20 variables.
Among them, only 4 groups each containing 15 true variables and 5
noise variables are associated to the response variables Z. We set the
p—vector C1 to have 15 1s, 30 —1s and 15 1.5s, the other components
being set to 0. All 15 non—zero coefficients are assigned randomly
into one group along with the remaining 5 zero coefficients corres—
ponding to noise variables (see top left panel of Supplementary Fig.
51). In the top four panels of Supplementary Figure 51, the standard
deviation (7 has been set to 0.5. A standard deviation (7 : 2.5 is set
for the other panels. Supplementary Figure 51 displays the results of
the loading vectors “1 recovered by sPLS, gPLS and sgPLS. Notice
that sPLS and sgPLS recover satisfactorily the true “1 when the noise
is small (a : 0.5). However, when a : 2.5, sPLS selects more noise
variables than the true “1 and misses out some true variables while
sgPLS still works well. For both situations, gPLS recovers all groups
but gives false positives within the groups. We arrive at the same
conclusion when the q : 500 variables of Z are divided into CY: 25
groups (see Supplementary Figs 52—55). In this situation, we con—
sider a model with two latent variables £1 and £2. The vector C2 is
chosen in the same way as previously described for C1. The two col—
umns of D are q—vectors containing 15 —1s, 15 —1.5s and 30 1s and
the rest are 0 s. For a small standard deviation (7 : 0.5
(Supplementary Figs 52—53), all methods perform well to recover
the loading vectors “1 and U1 related to the first component and the
loading vectors u; and U2 related to the second component.
However, gPLS gives false positives within the groups. For a high
standard deviation 0 : 2.5 (Supplementary Figs 54—55), sPLS selects
more noise variables, while sgPLS still performs well by selecting
only relevant variables into the true groups.

3.3 Effect of noise

We investigate the performance of our methods with respect to
noise. This simulation corresponds to the situation when the q : 10
variables from dataset Z have not been divided into groups and
when one latent variable has been generated. We use a sequence of
10 equispaced standard deviation values a, from 1.5 to 3.
Supplementary Figure 57 presents the average of TPR and TD over
50 replications for each method. For all noise levels, we found that
gPLS and sgPLS manage to recover the true groups. Thus, TD for
gPLS is equal to 20 as each of the 4 true groups contains 5 noise
variables (FP). However, for high values of noise, the sparsity intro—
duced within the group by sgPLS misses out some true variables.
Note that sPLS also misses out true variables when the noise is
increased and gets the highest TD due to the high number of false
positives selected. We present in Supplementary Figure 56 the aver—
age, over 50 replications, of the signal recovered (original loading
“1) by the three methods when a : 3. This figure highlights the num—
ber of false positives selected by sPLS.

3.4 Effect of the number of true variables in the group

We investigate the performance of our methods when the number of
true variables within each group is varied. We are still in the frame—
work of one latent variable generated and only the p : 400 variables

[BJO'SWHIHOIPJOJXO'SOplZIIJJOJLItOIQ/[idnq

B.Liquet et al.

 

from dataset X have been divided into groups. Among them, 40
variables are associated to the latent variable. Dataset X contains
GX:40 groups, each with the same group size of 10. We set the
sample size n : 100 and the standard deviation of the
noise 0:2. The number of groups containing true variables is
varied in {4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40} while each group contains 10, 8, 5, 4, 2
and 1 true variables, respectively. Supplementary Figure 58 presents
the average results over 50 replications. When true variables are dis—
tributed in 4 and 5 groups, both gPLS and sgPLS give a much higher
value of TPR and a lower value of TD than sPLS. When the true
variables are more sparsely distributed into different groups (num—
ber of groups increased), gPLS still gives high TPR but TD is
increased. Note that sgPLS is the best method with high TPR and
low TD values.

3.5 Effect of sample size

We investigate the performance of our methods when the sample
size is increased by steps of 50 from 11:50 to 11:500. Dataset X
contains GX:40 groups, each with the same group size of 10.
Among the {7:400 variables in dataset X, 60 are true variables,
which are distributed evenly into 6 groups. This clearly advantages
gPLS. Supplementary Figure 59 presents the average results over 50
replications of TPR and TD with respect to different sample sizes. It
can be seen that gPLS gives better results than the two other meth—
ods by finding the true groups whatever the sample size. For both
sPLS and sgPLS, TPR increases while TD decreases when sample
size increases. The TPR of sPLS is most of the time lower than that
of sgPLS. Moreover, the TD of sPLS is higher than both those of
gPLS and sgPLS.

3.6 Effect of the dimension p

We investigate the performance of our methods when the dimension
p of X is increasing (p E {500,1000,2000,3000,4000}).Dataset X
contains Gx : 17/50 groups, each with the same group size of 50.
Among the GX groups, 17/100 groups contains 35 true variables.
This simulation corresponds to the situation when the q : 10 vari—
ables from dataset Z have not been divided into groups and when
one latent variable has been generated. We set different sample size
n : 25, 50 and 100. The standard deviation of the noise is a : 3.5.
Supplementary Table 54 presents the average results over 50 replica—
tions of TPR, false—positive rate (FPR) and TD for the different val—
ues of p and for different sample sizes. In this simulation setting
gPLS manages to find the true groups whatever the dimension p and
the sample size. As 15 noise variables are included in each true
group, gPLS method gets higher FPR and TD than sgPLS and sPLS.
Almost every time, sgPLS outperforms sPLS by getting higher TPR
and lower TD and FPR.

3.7 Application for an HIV vaccine evaluation study

3.7.1 Description of the study

The method has been applied to an HIV vaccine trial: the DALIA
trial (Levy et al., 2014). In this trial, 19 HIV—infected patients have
been included for an evaluation of the safety and the immunogen—
icity of a dendritic—cell—based vaccine. The vaccine was injected on
weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12, while patients received an antiretroviral ther—
apy. An interruption of the antiretrovirals was performed at week
24 and the treatment was resumed if the CD4 +T cell count
dropped below 350 cells/ApL. After vaccination, a deep evaluation
of the immune response was performed at week 16 while repeated
measurements of the main immune markers and gene expression
were performed every 4 weeks until the end of the trial at 48 weeks.

The analyses of the immune markers showed a strong immunolo—
gical response especially among the CD4 +T cell populations with
an increase of cells producing various cytokines. After the antiretro—
viral treatment interruption, there was a strong viral replication that
was heterogeneous among the study population and the immune re—
sponse appeared to be associated with the observed maximum value
of viral load during the rebound (Lévy et al., 2014). One of the ques—
tion that follows these results was whether the immune response
and its impact on the viral dynamics could be explained and pre—
dicted with the observation of the change of gene expression during
vaccination. To answer this question, we first analyzed the repeated
measurements of gene abundance performed by microarrays
(Illumina HumanHT—12 v4). Because of the sparsity of the measure—
ments, only geneset analyses allow to detect significant changes over
time of group of genes. Using previously defined group of genes, so
called modules (Chaussabel et al., 2008), we reported a significant
change of gene expression among 69 modules over time before anti—
retroviral treatment interruption. Then, we asked how the gene
abundance of the 5399 genes (17) from these 69 modules as measured
at week 16 correlated with immune markers measured at the same
time point. The immune markers were either direct measurement of
cytokine concentrations on supernatants (IL21, IL2, IL13, IFNg) or
a combination of markers as measured by multiplex and intracellu—
lar staining (Luminex score, TH1 score, CD4 polyfunctionnality).
Seven (q) different immune markers have been used in the current
application. Measurements and calculations are detailed elsewhere
(Levy et al., 2014). Of note, the modules as defined in Chaussabel et
al. (2008) were not overlapping: each gene contributed to only one
module. To use the present approach with overlapping groups of
genes (such as in Gene Ontology), an extension in the spirit of Jacob
et al. (2009) would be required.

3.7.2 Results

The selection process of the genes according to the mean square
error of prediction criteria for each method is shown in
Supplementary Figures 511—513. Supplementary Table 55 shows the
cumulative percentage of variation of the responses variables ex—
plained by the components according to the method. With three
components, more than 80% of the variance could be explained.
The sgPLS methods selected slightly more genes than the sPLS
(respectively, 487 and 420 genes selected), but sgPLS selected fewer
modules than the sPLS (respectively, 21 and 64 groups of genes se—
lected). Of note, all the 21 groups of genes selected by the sgPLS
were included in those selected by the sPLS method. sgPLS selected
slightly more modules than gPLS (4 more, 14/21 in common).
However, gPLS led to more genes selected than sgPLS (944).
Supplementary Figure 510 displays Venn diagrams of the selected
sets by the three methods, both at the gene and module levels.
Therefore, in this context of hierarchical data, sgPLS ends up being
more parsimonious than sPLS in term of modules and than gPLS in
term of genes by taking the most predictive genes within a selected
module (see Supplementary Table 56). Such results are consistent
with those of the simulation study. The selection of the most predict—
ive genes inside a module improves the prediction capacity and does
not avoid any interpretation of the biological significance of the re—
maining genes inside a module based on the biological knowledge
available for this module.

Interestingly, the modules commonly selected by the three
approaches were the most biologically relevant ones, such as the
modules associated to inflammation (M3.2, M4.13, M42, M46,
M7.1) and cellular responses (M3.6 cytotoxic/NK cell, 4.15 on

T cells). A significant number of additional modules have been se—
lected by sPLS but not by the other methods. Although, some are
biologically sound (e.g. M3.1 Erythrocytes), many were not anno—
tated or are unrelated to the immune system making the hypothesis
of false signals likely. Regarding the modules differentially selected
by sgPLS and gPLS, three modules were selected by gPLS but not by
sgPLS (M4.11 Plasma cells and undetermined modules 4.8 and
7.35), whereas seven modules were selected by sgPLS and not by
gPLS (M3.5 and M47 Cell cycle, M4.1 T cell, M5.1 and M5.7 in—
flammation, M6.7 and M52 undetermined). Clearly, the selection
by sgPLS sounds more biologically relevant as M4.1 is known to be
associated to the other T—cell module M4.15 that was selected by
both methods (see www.biir.net/public_wikis/module_annotation/
V2_Trial_8_Modules). This is the same for the inflammatory mod—
ules M5.1 and M5.7 that are known to be related. In regards of the
module M4.11 (plasma cells), we have already notice that its
selection was not robust in bootstrap analyses performed with sPLS
(data not shown). Therefore, in this application, the sgPLS approach
led to a parsimonious selection of modules and genes that sound
very relevant biologically and is in agreement with the simulation
results.

An illustration of the results is shown through the correlation
matrix in Supplementary Figure 514 according to the genes selected
in common by the three methods. Genes and modules negatively or
positively associated to the immune response appeared very clearly.
As expected, inflammatory modules were negatively correlated to
the immune response whereas modules related to the cellular im—
mune response (M3.6, M4.15) were positively correlated to the im—
mune response.

Stability of the module selection has been assessed for sPLS,
gPLS and sgPLS (see Supplementary Fig. 515) in the spirit of Bach
(2008), Meinshausen and Buhlmann (2010) and Le Cao et al.
(2011a, b). It highlights the insights gained from incorporating the
grouping structure into the analysis, comforting the above biological
conclusions. Also, it reveals the instability of the selection of the
module 4.11 by sPLS and gPLS, module that was not selected by
sgPLS. Furthermore, we compared the proposed novel approach
with the multivariate lasso implemented in glmnet R package
(Friedman et al., 2010) and a multivariate (sparse) group lasso pro—
posed by Li et al. (2015). The two alternative approaches selected
less modules and genes but the modules selected were most often the
same across the different methods (see Supplementary Materials,
Section 51.7).

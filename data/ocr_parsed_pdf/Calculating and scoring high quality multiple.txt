l\bstract

Motivation: Calculating multiple protein structure alignments (MSAs) is important for understand—
ing functional and evolutionary relationships between protein families, and for modeling protein
structures by homology. While incorporating backbone flexibility promises to circumvent many of
the limitations of rigid MSA algorithms, very few flexible MSA algorithms exist today. This article
describes several novel improvements to the Kpax algorithm which allow high quality flexible
MSAs to be calculated. This article also introduces a new Gaussian—based MSA quality measure
called 'M—score’, which circumvents the pitfalls of RMSD—based quality measures.

Results: As well as calculating flexible MSAs, the new version of Kpax can also score MSAs from
other aligners and from previously aligned reference datasets. Results are presented for a large—
scale evaluation of the Homstrad, SABmark and SISY benchmark sets using Kpax and Matt as ex—
amples of state—of—the—art flexible aligners and 3DCOMB as an example of a state—of—the—art rigid
aligner. These results demonstrate the utility of the M—score as a measure of MSA quality and
show that high quality MSAs may be achieved when structural flexibility is properly taken into
account

1 '"tmductm" MUSTA (Leibowitz et 111., 2001), CE—MC (Guda et 111., 2004),

Calculating multiple structure alignments (MSAs) of proteins is an
important step towards understanding the evolutionary and func—
tional relationships between different proteins and protein families
(Hasegawa and Holm, 2009; Sierk and Kleywegt, 2004).
Calculating high quality structural alignments can be crucial for the
accurate modelling of three—dimensional (3D) protein structures by
homology (Braberg et (11., 2012; Madhusudhan et (11., 2009), and
can improve the generation of MSA—based sequence profiles for pro—
tein fold prediction (Ghouzam et (11., 2015; Pei et (11., 2008). Many
algorithms for calculating protein structure alignments (SAs) have
been described and reviewed in recent years (Hasegawa and Holm,
2009; Kolodny et (11., 2005; Ma and Wang, 2014; Sierk and
Kleywegt, 2004), and several of these can calculate MSAs. Some ex—
amples of multiple structural aligners are SSAP (Taylor, 1994),

MultiProt (Shatsky et (11., 2004b), POSA (Ye and Godzik, 2005),
MAMMOTH—multi (Lupyan et (11., 2005), Vorolign (Birzele et (11.,
2006) MUSTANG (Konagurthu et (11., 2006), PROMALS3D (Pei
et (11., 2008), BLOMAPS (Wang and Zheng, 2009), SALIGN
(Madhusudhan et (11., 2009), MISTRAL (Micheletti and Orland,
2009), 3DCOMB (Wang et (11., 2011), MAPSCI (Ilinkin et (11.,
2010), Smolign (Sun et (11., 2012), msTALI (Shealy and Valafar,
2012) and mulPBA (Joseph et (11., 2012).

Most of the above approaches first use dynamic programming
(DP) to align pairs of structures, and they then progressively merge
the pair—wise alignments to make a MSA. A few approaches subse—
quently optimize the resulting MSA using distance—based (e.g. CE—
MC and MAMMOTH—multi) 0r energy—based (e.g. MISTRAL) min—
imization techniques. However, when aligning many structures, the

progressive alignment approaches can become computationally ex—
pensive because they require an initial set of all—against—all pair—wise
alignments to build a guide tree, which means that the computa—
tional cost scales as O(N)2 in the number of structures, N. In order
to avoid such computational costs, the MAPSCI and mulPBA algo—
rithms build a multiple alignment with respect to a given ‘pivot’
structure, which leads to a computational cost of O(N). But this re—
quires prior knowledge of which structure should serve as the pivot.
An effective alternative to conventional ‘row—first’ multiple align—
ment algorithms is 3DCOMB (Wang et (11., 2011), which uses a ‘col—
umn—first’ approach to identify ‘highly similar fragment blocks’ to
guide the calculation of MSAs. While 3DCOMB has been shown to
give excellent MSAs (Wang et (11., 2011), the complexity of its
column—first algorithm also appears to scale as O(N)2 in the number
of structures.

Because it is difficult to optimize simultaneously the number of
aligned residues and their Ca, root mean squared deviation (RMSD)
(Zemla, 2003), different structure aligners make different number/
RMSD trade—offs which can lead to producing locally different align—
ments, even within proteins that share common motifs. Thus, current
SA algorithms can introduce errors or inconsistencies even in pair—
wise alignments (Sadowski and Taylor, 2012), and these errors can
accumulate considerably in MSA algorithms that progressively merge
multiple pair—wise alignments. Furthermore, such effects can con—
found efforts to compare different MSA algorithms against reference
SAs, because the programs used to calculate the reference SAs are
themselves subject to the same number/RMSD trade—off problem.

Incorporating backbone ﬂexibility offers one way to tackle such
problems. Although some ﬂexible SA algorithms have been
described, such as FlexProt (Shatsky et (11., 2002, 2004a), FATCAT
(Ye and Godzik, 2003), POSA (Li et (11., 2014; Ye and Godzik,
2005), FlexSnap (Salem et (11., 2010), Matt (Menke et (11., 2008) and
RAPIDO (Mosca et (11., 2008), still only a very few algorithms can
ﬂexibly align multiple structures. Furthermore, other ‘ﬂexible’ align—
ers such as Vorolign (Birzele et (11., 2006) and GR—Align (Malod—
Dognin and Przulj, 2014) can align pairs of structures that cannot
be completely superposed rigidly, but they do not perform
superpositions.

To my knowledge, the only aligners that can calculate multiple
superpositions ﬂexibly are POSA (Ye and Godzik, 2005 ), Matt
(Menke et (11., 2008) and Smoalign (Sun et (11., 2012). POSA essen—
tially extends the pair—wise FATCAT approach to MSAs. Both
POSA and Smolign calculate partial—order alignment graphs, i.e. lists
of locally aligned segments which are common to all structures but
which are not necessarily sequential in the primary protein se—
quences. In contrast, both Matt and Kpax calculate strictly sequen—
tial MSAs which do not allow non—sequential permutations of
residues. Unfortunately, POSA is publicly available only as a web
server (Li et (11., 2014), which makes it infeasible for large—scale stud—
ies, and Smolign is no longer available for download.

While the original Kpax pair—wise alignment algorithm is suffi—
ciently fast to be able to search large 3D structural domain data—
bases in just a few seconds, the first version was limited to
performing only rigid—body superpositions of entire protein struc—
tures. This article describes several extensions to the earlier Kpax al—
gorithm (Ritchie et (11., 2012) which allow pairs of proteins of
arbitrary size (including multi—domain proteins) to be aligned ﬂex—
ibly, and which allow multiple proteins to be assembled into a MSA
using a pivot—based approach.

It seems obvious that a pre—requisite for calculating high quality
MSAs is to begin with an algorithm that can calculate high quality
pair—wise SAs. However, there does not yet exist an accepted

standard for assessing the quality of pair—wise alignments or MSAs.
3DCOMB (Wang et (11., 2011), calculates its MSA quality measure
from the pair—wise TM—score (Zhang and Skolnick, 2005) taken
over all fully aligned columns. On the other hand, for columns with
an occupancy of 70% or more, mulPBA uses a quality measure
based on a weighted average of the numbers of residues whose pair—
wise distances fall within certain given distance ranges (Joseph et (11.,
2012). This may be considered as an extension of the Local—Global
Alignment (LGA) scoring method which calculates a weighted aver—
age over several number/RMSD bins of a pair—wise alignment
(Zemla, 2003). More recently, the STOVCA program (Slater et (11.,
2013) has been proposed to compare the quality of structural super—
positions calculated by other pair—wise aligners, but this program is
limited to evaluating pair—wise superpositions using its own internal
pair—wise alignment algorithm. Collier et al. (2014) proposed a
method for measuring SA quality based on information compres—
sion, but this approach is also limited to pair—wise alignments. Thus,
there exists a need for a simple and general way to compare the
quality of both the alignments and the corresponding superpositions
of different MSA algorithms. To try to address the problem of com—
paring different SA algorithms, this article proposes a novel atomic
Gaussian based MSA scoring function, called ‘M—score’, which cir—
cumvents the number/RMSD trade—off problem.

In previous studies, Wang et al. (2011) showed that 3DCOMB
gives highly competitive rigid MSAs compared to MAPSCI,
MAMOTH, Matt, BLOMAPS, MUSTANG and MultiProt when
applied to the large Homstrad (Mizuguchi et (11., 1998; Stebbings
and Mizuguchi, 2004) and SABmark (Van Walle et (11., 2005) bench—
mark sets, and Berbalk et al. (2009) showed that Matt gave the best
overall performance on a sub—set of their challenging SISY bench—
mark. Therefore, a similar large—scale comparison using these data—
sets is presented here to compare Kpax with 3DCOMB as an
example of a state—of—the—art rigid multiple aligner, and with Matt as
the best available ﬂexible multiple aligner.

2 Methods

2.1 Normalized atomic Gaussian overlap SAs

Kpax pair—wise SAs are calculated using two Ca—based scoring func—
tions, both of which are based on Gaussian density distributions. In
the main scoring function, each Ca, atom is represented as a
normalized 3D atomic Gaussian shape—density distribution.

where r : )g) is the distance from the nucleus and a is the atomic ra—
dius. I put a : 1.4 A, which is slightly less than the van der Waals
radius of 1.5  often used in molecular mechanics force fields. A
similar 3D Gaussian representation has been shown to provide an
effective model of molecular shape for small—molecule shape com—
parison and virtual drug screening (Grant et (11., 1996).

It is well known that Gaussian functions have special mathemat—
ical properties. For example, it has long been known that the over—
lap between a product of two Gaussian functions is also a Gaussian
(see Equation 10 in Boys, 1950). In particular, it can be shown that
the 3D overlap between two of the above normalized 3D Gaussian
functions on atoms i and j located at £1. and £7. and separated by a
distance R,,- :  — 5].) is given by

High quality multiple flexible protein structure alignments

 

This overlap expression has the nice property that it gives a value
of one unit when two Ca, atoms are perfectly superposed because
e0 : 1. Furthermore, when the distance between atoms 1' and / ex—
ceeds the sum, S, of their Ca, radii, we have S : 2a and e‘RZ/S2 tends
to zero very rapidly when R > S. Thus, while other Gaussian scoring
functions have been used to provide probabilistic or ‘elastic’ scoring
functions in previous SA algorithms, notably STAMP (Russell and
Barton, 1992) and DALI (Holm and Sander, 1993), it can be seen
that the form of Equation 2 is rather special, and is certainly not ar—
bitrary. Using the above physical model of protein shape, a SA be—
tween two proteins may be scored by summing pairs of Gaussian
overlaps to give a global alignment score, or ‘G—score’

G : Zia-G), (3)
LI

where the coefficient 11,-,- : 1 when residue 1' of the first protein is
aligned to residue / of the second protein, and zero otherwise.

However, the above scoring function requires that a pair—wise
alignment and 3D superposition are already known, which is ini—
tially not the case. Therefore, in order to identify candidate aligned
fragment pairs (AFPs) for least—squares fitting and superposition,
Kpax calculates an initial pose—invariant similarity score for all pos—
sible residue pairs using a scoring function based on a sliding win—
dow of 7 residues on each chain (i.e. 6 Ca, pairs, around the pair of
interest), and using products of normalized Gaussian overlaps at
each position, which I call ‘K—scores’, as described previously
(Ritchie et (11., 2012). Products, rather than sums, of local Gaussian
overlap scores are used to calculate an initial alignment in order that
a pair—wise K—score tends rapidly to zero whenever any of its compo—
nent distances are large. Thus, only those residue pairs that share
highly similar local environments will have large K—scores. Applying
dynamic programming (DP) to a matrix of such K—scores, produces
an initial seed alignment, or ‘K—alignment’, from which runs of 4 or
more pairs (AFPs) having large K—scores may be identified and used
as 3D superposition seeds.

The K—alignment of a pair of similar protein domains typically
contains up to about 10 AFPs, whereas a pair of large domains with
many similar secondary structure elements may give up to around
50 AFPs. For each candidate 3D superposition seed proposed by a
K—alignment AFP, an all—against all matrix of Ca, G—scores (the ‘G—
matrix’) is calculated, from which a global alignment may be calcu—
lated by DP with no gap penalties. The residue pairs extracted from
the resulting ‘G—alignment’ are then used to define a new 3D least—
squares fitting transformation, and the cycle is iterated until conver—
gence (typically just 3 or 4 iterations are required). The G—alignment
that gives the best global G—score is then retained as the the ‘optimal’
global alignment. From my experiments with the examples pre—
sented here, using any value of a that differs much from 1.4  gener—
ally gives poorer alignments (details not shown). Hence, putting
a : 1.4  appears to be numerically ‘optimal’ in practice, as well as
theory.

2.2 Detecting conserved motifs using tiled DP

Although Kpax uses the very fast and robust quaternion mini—
mization least squares fitting method of Liu et al. (2010), and only a
relatively small number of least—squares fits are necessary, the over—
all computational cost of the above procedure scales as O(N)2 in the
number of residues to be aligned. This makes it is relatively expen—
sive to align large multi—domain proteins by iterating on multiple
candidate G—matrices. Furthermore, it is possible that the optimal
DP trace—back from the K—matrix might not contain any 3D fitting

seeds that correspond to an optimal 3D G—alignment. Therefore,
when one or both proteins has more than 120 residues, a series of
small ‘tiled’ SAs is calculated, in which each protein is divided into
overlapping strips of 72 residues, and a local SA is calculated be—
tween each strip of one protein and the whole of the other protein
using DP on the tiles of the K and G matrices. For example, when
aligning two proteins each having 144 residues, a total of 6 tiled
alignments are calculated using the residue ranges (1:71,1:144),
(37:108,1:144), (73:144, 1:144), (1:144,1:71), (1:144, 37:108),
(1:144,73:144). The 3D transformation from the tile that gives the
greatest G—score is retained and used in a final DP iteration on the
the full G—matrix. This approach is easily generalized to the case
where the number of residues is not a whole multiple of the tile size.
For example, a protein of 200 residues would be divided into strips
of (1:64), (65:136), (137:200), (1:28), (29:100), (101:172) and
(173:200).

For large proteins, tiling reduces the computational cost from
O(FNZ) to O(Tfnz) where F is the number of AFPs in the global
alignment, f is the average number of fragments in a tile, T is the
number of tiles of size n, and where n < N and T < N.
Furthermore, tiling allows the possibility of finding good local 3D
seeds in the K—alignment which might not appear in the (globally op—
timal) trace—back path of the full K—matrix. In other words, small
conserved motifs may be detected in a tiled alignment whereas they
might be completely missed in a global alignment.

Since it is not known in advance whether a given pair of proteins
will align well globally or whether a tiled alignment should be
applied, Kpax first attempts a global alignment and if the global
alignment M—score (see below) is less than 0.5, it applies a tiled
alignment in order to find the best seed for a global alignment.

2.3 Flexible alignments using multiple DP boxes
Calculating ﬂexible alignments may be considered as a natural ex—
tension of the above tiled approach, in which the tiles no longer
have a pre—determined size. For Kpax ﬂexible alignments, all resi—
dues are initially labelled as belonging to a default segment
(Segment 0), and after the optimal rigid superposition has been cal—
culated as described above, all pairs of residues that fall within a
given distance threshold (3 A, by default) are assigned to a new seg—
ment (Segment 1). The remaining Segment 0 residues of each struc—
ture are then considered as candidates for ﬂexible refinement. More
specifically, the first DP problem corresponds to the entire DP ma—
trix, and consecutive runs of four or more residue pairs belonging to
Segment 0 are identified and superposed by least—squares fitting. The
initial DP matrix is then divided into three or more ‘boxes’, where
the first box spans the first and last residue pairs of segment 1, thus
leaving one N—terminal and one C—terminal box of the DP matrix,
each of which contains candidate residues for ﬂexible refinement. It
is also possible for one or more DP boxes to be found within the in—
terior of a superposed segment (i.e. segments do not necessarily con—
tain continuous runs of superposed residues). In any case, each new
DP box may be considered as a new SA sub—problem, which may be
treated exactly as described above. Thus, by maintaining a list of DP
boxes to be processed on a stack, the ﬂexible alignment procedure
continues recursively, and it terminates when no more DP boxes re—
main in the stack.

The evolution of the DP matrix for the first few iterations of this
procedure is illustrated schematically in Supplementary Figure S1.
Each residue in the moving structure is transformed in 3D space at
most two times: once during the rigid body superposition, and pos—
sibly once again if it belongs to a DP box that produces a

superposition segment. Note, when superposing a moving segment
to a rigid template structure, the coordinates of the neighbouring
residues relative to the moving segment are taken into account
whenever possible. Thus, the final ﬂexibly aligned structure has few
obvious gaps or tears in its backbone atom coordinates.

2.4 Pivot—first method of calculating MSAs

In Kpax, MSAs are calculated using a rigid pivot structure onto
which the remaining structures are either rigidly or ﬂexibly aligned
and superposed. By default, in both rigid and flexible MSAs, each
structure is used in turn as the pivot structure, and the MSA that
yields the best overall M—score is retained as the pivot. Thus, for N
structures, there will be N—1 alignments between the selected pivot
and each of the remaining structures. A MSA may then be induced
from the N—1 pair—wise alignments by introducing additional gaps as
necessary to re—align the N—2 gapped pivot structures with the pivot
of the first alignment. While this induced MSA (IMSA) is not neces—
sarily optimal, it provides a fast way to identify highly conserved
columns in the alignment. Any column of the IMSA which is occu—
pied with 60% or more residues is noted as a highly conserved
column.

The IMSA is used to provide a look—up table for building a final
MSA. Kpax first sorts the N—1 other structures by their G—score simi—
larity to the pivot. It then takes the most similar structure as a seed
alignment, and it builds the final MSA by incrementally aligning the
remaining N—2 structures in a ‘pile—up’ manner onto this seed. Each
in—coming conserved residue is biased to appear close to its position
in the initial IMSA by calculating column—wise G—scores for a win—
dow of i 16 residues around the corresponding IMSA position.
Thus, the alignment of conserved regions may be further optimized
by DP, and in—coming non—conserved residues have the opportunity
to be re—aligned against the preceding structures. Consequently, the
Kpax MSA algorithm may be considered as a ‘pivot—first’ hybrid be—
tween the row—first and column—first approaches.

Although it is conceivable that one could use a guide—tree to align
multiple pairs of flexibly aligned structures, this could lead to many
false AFPs and many tears in the moving structures. The above pile—
up approach helps to ensure that the number of deformations to the
ﬂexible structures is small, and that each non—rigid structure is de—
formed only once. A pile—up approach also allows for easy parallel
execution on multiple processors.

2.5 What is wrong with RMSD?
There are two fundamental problems with RMSD as a quality meas—
ure. First, it is non—linear in the number of distances concerned.
Second, RMSDs can hide many sins. Consider one column of a MSA
of 10 structures, in which 9 of the Ca, atoms superpose perfectly, but
one is displaced by 5  and therefore probably belongs to an adja—
cent column (recall that the distance between consecutive Ca back—
bone atoms is normally 3.8 A). Suppose we calculate the RMSD
with respect the average column coordinate (which for convenience
can be assumed to be at the coordinate origin, and where the dis—
placement is along one of the principal axes). This gives
((9 >l< 0.52 + 1 >l< 4.52)/10)1/2 : 1.50  Now consider one column
of a MSA of 20 structures, with one Ca, again displaced by 5  This
gives ((19 >i< 0.252 + 1 >l< 4.752)/20)1/2 : 1.08  In other words,
increasing the number of rows has spread the displacement over
more samples and hence apparently reduced the RMSD by about
30%.

But one should not forget that RMSD has units of ‘distance’/
(‘number—of—pairs. ’)1/2. So it would be more precise to label each

RMSD with the number of pairs involved, e.g. RMSD10 : 1.50 A,
and RMSD20 : 1.08  This reminds us that it is incorrect to com—
pare or combine RMSD10 and RMSD20 directly because they were
calculated using different distance scales. Consequently, a fairer way
to compare these two cases is to extract the average deviations as
RMSD10/J10 : 0.47 A and RMSD20/m : 0.24 13. But this obvi—
ously amounts to not using RMSD in the first place. If we wish to
score and compare SAs reliably, it seems much more desirable to
call a gap for the displaced residue, and to award scores of 9 out of
10 (say) for the first example and 19 out of 20 for second. This is
what the M—score aims to achieve.

2.6 MSA quality assessment using the M—score

The M—score extends the pair—wise Ca, Gaussian overlap model to
MSAs of arbitrary dimensions. First, let N be the total number of
rows (i.e. structures) in a MSA, C be the total number of columns, T
be the total number of residues over all structures, and L be the
number of residues in the longest structure. Thus, an ‘ideal’ MSA
may be considered to have at least one row of L residues and the re—
maining (T — L) residues from the other structures would each align
perfectly with one of the residues of the longest structure. This
implies than many of the MSA columns must contain 2 or more
completely overlapping Ca, atoms.

A simple way to estimate this mutual overlap is to calculate an
average coordinate for each column, and then to calculate the degree
of overlap between this average coordinate and each of the column
members. Using these ideas, the column overlap score C,- with re—
spect to the average 3D coordinate, g], for the jth column may be
defined as:

N —(x —c)2/4crz
Ci 2 2.11173 “I ‘I 7 (4)
i:1

where 11,-,- is either 1 or 0 according to whether the position at row i
and column / contains a residue or a gap, respectively, and ii]. is the
coordinate of the Ca, atom at row i and columns /. Note that one
wrongly placed Ca, atom will reduce this score by at most one unit.
On the other hand, if all of the Ca, coordinates in column / coincide
with the average coordinate, then C,- will be numerically equal to the
number of residues in that column. Thus, a global overlap score may
be calculated for the MSA as

C
M’ : (T—L)+C—Zmax(C,-,1), (5)
[:1

where the max function ensures that at least one unit is subtracted
for each column, and thus deals with columns that contain only a
few very poorly superposed Ca, atoms, which may occur at the ter—
mini of an alignment or in the loop regions around an AFP. If all of
the Ca, atoms in each column coincide completely with the average
column coordinate, then C : L and  max(C,-, 1) : T, and hence
M’ : 0. On the other hand, in the worst possible case of no aligned
residue pairs, we have 2. : £17. for all i and hence C]- : 1 for all /.
Therefore, for any MSA, M’ will have the range
0 g M’ g (T— L).

However, because it is more intuitive to let large scores corres—
pond to good alignments, the above expression may be scaled and
shifted using M : 1 — M’/(T — L) to give

2:1 max(C,-, 1) — C
M : —/ (T _ L) . (6)

aListed are the numbers of segments (S; not available for Matt), aligned pairs (A), aligned residue identities (I), the alignment RMSD in A units (R) and the M—
score (M). The highest M—score for each pair is shown in bold. The Matt alignments were made using Matt—1.00 (Menke et a1., 2008). The FATCAT alignments

were made using jFATCAT (Prlié et a1., 2010).

bThe A chain is used in all PDB structures except for 3hhr (chain B), 1cew (chain I), 1nsb (chain B) and 1bge (chain B).

With this scoring function, a perfect multiple alignment of any num—
ber of structures (e.g. between any protein and one or more identical
copies of itself) would give a score of unity. Furthermore, for pair—
wise alignments, the factor (T — L) will be equal to the number of
residues in the smaller structure, and a score of unity will correspond
to the complete overlap of all Ca, atoms of the smaller structure with
some subset of the Ca, atoms of the larger structure. If desired, the
M—score may be multipled by (T — L)a3 to give an absolute quality
measure in A3 units.

It may be noted that the M—score contains no gap penalties and
has no distance bins or distance cut—offs. Its only potentially adjust—
able parameter is the Ca radius, which in practice should be fixed at
1.4  Furthermore, by construction, the only way to maximize M is
to have as few columns as possible of which some subset must each
contain two or more maximally overlapping Ca, atoms. This means
that the M—score smoothly circumvents the number/RMSD trade—off
problem.

In cases where two or more proteins share only a small motif, or
where they have long unaligned N or C termini, it can be useful to
restrict the M—score to a given block of the MSA. For example, to
score the alignment of a motif between columns ] and K, it is
straight—forward to calculate

2:] max(C,-, 1) — CIK

M :
1K (TJK - LIK)

(7)
where GK and TJK denote the number of columns and total number
of residues between columns ] and K, respectively, and LJK is the
longest chain within that block.

2.7 Comparing pair—wise SA algorithms

As a first but important comparison, Table 1 shows the flexible
alignment results calculated by Kpax, Matt and FATCAT for for the
10 ‘difficult’ pairs of structures from Fischer et al. (1996).
Supplementary Table S1 shows the results for the corresponding
rigid alignment calculated by Kpax, Matt, FATCAT, 3DCOMB,
TMalign, MUSTANG, CE and DALI. Comparison of the numbers
of aligned residues and the RMSDs with the corresponding M—score
in these tables shows that the M—score captures rather well the aim
to reward a high number of aligned pairs with low RMSD. For ex—
ample, in the first row of Table 1 (1fxi/1ubq), Kpax aligns 64 pairs
with a RMSD of 2.0 and M:O.684, whereas FATCAT aligns 63

pairs but with a worse RMSD of 3.0  and M : 0.492. On the other
hand, Matt aligns a smaller number of pairs with a lower RMSD
(49 pairs for 1.0 A) which yields M:O.607. Similar observations
may be made for the other example pairs in both tables. In general,
it can be seen that Matt tends to align fewer pairs for a lower
RMSD, whereas FATCAT aligns more pairs for a higher RMSD. Of
the rigid aligners, it can be seen that MUSTANG gives the poorest
rigid alignment figures with an average of 125 pairs at 3.2  yielding
M: 0.398. More importantly, it can be seen from these two tables
that for a comparable number of aligned pairs, a lower RMSD yields
a higher M—score, and for similar RMSDs a larger number of aligned
pairs yields a higher M—score. This shows that the M—score captures
rather well the simultaneous objective of finding a large number of
aligned pairs with a low RMSD. Overall, according to the M—scores,
Table 1 shows that Kpax produces better ﬂexible alignments than
both Matt and FATCAT, while Supplementary Table S1 shows that
Kpax and 3DCOMB produce amongst the best rigid alignments.

2.8 Flexiny aligning multi—domain proteins

To my knowledge, the FlexProt algorithm of Shatsky et al. (2002,
2004a) is the first structure aligner to have been developed to handle
structural ﬂexibility in large multi—domain proteins which cannot be
rigidly superposed. According to the M—scores in Table 2, Kpax
often produces better ﬂexible alignments for the 18 structure pairs
of Shatsky et al. (average Kpax M—score: 0.794) than both Matt
(M : 0.732) and FATCAT (M : 0.689). Although the average num—
bers of aligned residues and residue identities are similar for Kpax
and FATCAT (245 and 129 for Kpax compared to 254 and 132 for
FATCAT, respectively), the lower average RMSD for Kpax (1.4 
compared to 2.3 A) accounts for its greater average M—score. As in
Table 1, Matt produces some very low RMSD alignments, but this
is at the expense of finding fewer aligned pairs and pair—wise identi—
ties. It may be noted that Matt finds sub—optimal alignments in at
least three cases (2bbm/1cll, 2bbm/1top and 1mcp/1tcr) in which
the M—scores and numbers of aligned residues are significantly lower
than those for Kpax and FATCAT. In contrast, Kpax finds only one
sub—optimal alignment (1a21/1hwg) relative to the Matt and
FATCAT alignments. Although FATCAT finds respectable align—
ments for all of the examples in Tables 1 and 2, in each case either
Kpax or Matt produces a better alignment according to the
M—score.

Fig. 1. Kpax rigid (left) and flexible (right) MSAs for SABmark superfamily
group104 (top row) and twighlight zone group202 (bottom row), drawn using
scripts generated by Kpax. The two groups of superpositions are not shown
at the same scale

2.9 Two flexible MSA examples

Figure 1 shows two examples of the rigid and ﬂexible MSA super—
positions produced by Kpax using the SABmark superfamily
group104 (‘sup—group104’) and twilight—zone group202 (‘twi—
group202’). In this figure, the structures are coloured using a simple
but informative ‘rainbow’ colour—coding scheme, in which the resi—
dues in consecutive columns of a MSA are coloured in consecutive
colours of the rainbow. These examples demonstrate the benefit of
using each member structure as a candidate rigid pivot structure.
For sup—group104 (consisting of the four SCOP structures: d1lgpa_,
d1dmza_, d1g6ga_ and d1gxca_), the best rigid MSA pivot is found
to be d1dmza_, giving M:O.626 and 68 core columns, while the
worst pivot (d1lgpa_) gives M: 0.541 and 64 core columns.
However, for a ﬂexible MSA with d1lgpa_ as pivot, the above qual—
ity measures increase to M:O.779 and 97 core columns. On the
other hand, the best pivot changes to d1g6ga_, giving M:O.784

and 98 core columns. This shows that the best pivot for a ﬂexible
MSA cannot necessarily be predicted from rigid pair—wise SAs.

While Figure 1 suggests that calculating a MSA for sup—
group104 should be relatively easy, it also shows that aligning all
three members of twi—group202 (SCOP codes d1l2wi_, d1k8kd1
and d1jyoa_) is much more challenging. In this case, the rigid Kpax
MSA gives only 14 core columns and M:O.285. In contrast, the
Kpax ﬂexible MSA (lower right in Fig. 1) gives 51 core columns and
M : 0.750. This demonstrates the improvement that may be
achieved on going from a rigid to a ﬂexible MSA.

2.10 The Homstrad, SABmark and SISY benchmarks
The version of Homstrad used here (October 2014) consists of 1032
families of homologous protein families containing a total of 3458
structures. Each Homstrad family contains from 2 to 25 members,
where no two members of any family have more than 90% sequence
identity (Stebbings and Mizuguchi, 2004). The Homstrad SAs were
calculated using STAMP, MNYFIT (Sutcliffe et al., 1987) and
COMPARER (Sali and Blundell, 1990).

The SABmark dataset (version 1.65) contains multiple align—
ments for 3320 structures belonging of 425 superfamilies with low
sequence identity and 1740 structures belonging to 209 ‘twighlight
zone’ families with very low sequence identity. The SABmark data—
set has only sequence—based pair—wise reference alignments. It has
been shown that these alignments contain mutual inconsistencies
(Edgar, 2010), hence it impossible to reconstruct MSAs from the ref—
erence pairs. Consequently, it is not possible to calculate M—scores
or core columns for SABmark.

The SISY datasets were collected by Berbalk et al. (2009), who
calculated the SISY reference alignments using CE and DALI. SISY—
Families consists of 106 families of single chain SCOP domains with
less than 40% sequence identity. SISY—pairs consists of 130 protein
pairs with low sequence similarity drawn from the SISYPHUS data—
base (Mayr et al., 2007). SISY—RIPC (repetitions, insertions,

permutations and conformational variability) consists of 23 pairs
which Berbalk et al. report to be difficult to align. Many of the SISY
reference alignments are given not as full alignments but as
‘trimmed’ alignments, consisting of a small list of highly conserved
reference pairs or MSA columns. Several of the examples in the
SISY—Pairs and SISY—RIPC datasets contain non—sequential align—
ments or small motifs within large unrelated folds which can be dif—
ficult to detect.

As noted by Berbalk et al., some aligners can fail when presented
with a PDB file that contains more than one structure, or when a
PDB file contains SEQRES records that differ from the ATOM re—
cords. Therefore, all SISY structures involving more than one chain
per PDB file were excluded, and the remaining PDB files were
cleaned by running Kpax with the ‘—preprocess’ option to change
HETERO amino acid records to ATOM records, and to remove all
other HETERO and SEQRES records. After cleaning, 3DCOMB
was found to fail with a memory fault on 2 of the SISY examples
and Matt gave a memory fault or failed to terminate on 6 examples.
Excluding the above cases left a total of 77 SISY—Families, 1 11 SISY—
Pairs and 23 SISY—RIPC examples. Applying the same cleaning pro—
cedure to the Homstrad dataset detected 7 PDB files with duplicate
or corrupted PDB chains, and these were also excluded.
Additionally, 5 SABmark superfamily groups and 4 SABmark twigh—
light zone groups were eliminated because their reference alignments
contained no pairs.

2.11 MSA benchmark quality comparison

Table 3 presents results for the alignments calculated by Kpax, Matt
and 3DCOMB for the above benchmark datasets. The Homstrad
dataset provides superposed structures and a PIR—format MSA align—
ment file. Hence it is possible to calculate several common quality
measures such as the number of fully aligned core columns (‘#Core’
in Table 3), the number of aligned pairs (‘#Pair’), the number of
aligned residue identities (‘#Identity’), and the average RMSD over
all aligned pairs. Additionally, since such global measures do not
take into account local alignment quality, it is useful calculate the
number of badly aligned pairs, and the number of superposed frag—
ment pairs (‘#SFP’), where a SFP is taken to be a run of three or
more aligned pairs in which the distance between each pair does not
exceed 3.5 A, and where any pair—wise distance that exceeds 8.0  is
counted as a distance violation (‘#Viol’). The columns labeled
“‘M1c’ and ‘MJK’ show the M—scores calculated for the full and
trimmed MSAs, respectively, where M1c ranges over all MSA col—
umns and MK is calculated between the columns containing the first
and last pair of aligned residues. The values shown for the number
of pairs, identities, distance violations, SFPs and RMSD values are
normalized by the number of pairs of structures involved (i.e. for N
structures, the normalization factor is N (N — 1) / 2). Supplementary
Figures S2—S10 show more detailed ‘box—whisker’ plots (Spitzer
et al., 2014) of the results in Table 3. Spread—sheets of numerical re—
sults are provided as Supplementary Files.

For this table, the RMSD values for the SABmark reference
alignments were calculated using the pair—wise reference alignments
to superpose the corresponding structures. The RMSD values for the
SISY reference alignments were calculated by iteratively superposing
the SISY structures onto an average coordinate for each reference
column. Because several of the SISY reference alignments contain
non—sequential SAs that cannot be fully aligned by sequential align—
ers, these datasets are grouped separately in Table 3 (denoted as
‘seq’ and ‘nonseq’, accordingly) because these sub—sets show rather
different statistics.

Several revealing observations may be made from Table 3. First,
it can be seen that some of the reference alignments contain many
distance violations, notable the Homstrad and SISY—RIPC—seq data—
sets. As observed previously for multiple sequence alignments
(Edgar, 2010), this means that structural reference alignments some—
times contain significant errors, and it is therefore dangerous to treat
even well curated reference alignments as a gold standard against
with different algorithms should be compared. In particular, for
Homstrad, it can be seen that 3DCOMB, Matt and Kpax all achieve
higher M—scores with lower numbers of cores columns and residue
identities than the Homstrad reference alignments, while the
Homstrad reference alignments give a higher average RMSD and
more distance violations than these three methods. For the SISY—
RIPC—seq reference set, most of the distance violations come from
just 3 pairs, with the pair d2bbma_/4clna_ having 114 distance vio—
lations, which is clearly incorrect, and the pairs d1ggga_/d1wdna_
and d1l5ba_/d1l5ea_ having 25 and 19 violations, respectively,
which make them of doubtful quality.

The large numbers of core columns calculated by 3DCOMB is
impressive, and no doubt reﬂects 3DCOMB’s strategy of aiming to
produce many filled columns (Wang et al., 2011), but this is often at
the expense of higher RMSDs and more distance violations than
Kpax and Matt. In contrast, Matt—ﬂex gives amongst the lowest
RMSDs and lowest numbers of distance violations on all datasets.
However, with the exception of some of the trimmed SISY reference
alignments, this is always at the expense of finding fewer aligned
pairs and residue identities than the other alignments.

It can be seen from Table 3 that Kpax—ﬂex produces the largest
average M—score while also finding the greatest number of residue
identities in all datasets except for Homstrad and the small SISY—
RIPC—nonseq group. Kpax—ﬂex also finds the largest average
trimmed M—score for the Homstrad and SABmark datasets, and it is
interesting to note that average trimmed M—score for Kpax—ﬂex is
larger than that of the reference alignments for the SISY—RIPC—seq
group. Furthermore, Kpax, Matt and 3DCOMB all find more
aligned pairs, residue identities, and AFPs in the SISY datasets than
are present in the SISY reference alignments. While the trimmed
SISY reference alignments have high MJK values, which is to be ex—
pected, the rigid alignments calculated by Kpax and Matt for the
full structures from the two SISY—Pairs datasets give lower RMSDs
than the RMSDs of the SISY reference alignments. Taken together,
these observations indicate that a high proportion of the SISY refer—
ence alignments contain sub—optimal alignments compared to those
calculated by Kpax, Matt and 3DCOMB. The box—whisker plots in
Supplementary Figures S5—S10 further support this observation.

Apart from the surprisingly high number of residue identities in
the Homstrad reference alignments, the Kpax ﬂexible alignments
contain the greatest number of aligned identities in all datasets ex—
cept for the SISY—Families—nonseq and SISY—RIPC—nonseq groups.
Additionally, the final column of Table 3 shows that the flexible
Kpax alignments contain the largest average number of SFPs in all
datasets. While it might be argued that ﬂexible Kpax is ‘over—fitting’
the 3D structures, it should be noted that the Kpax rigid alignments
also contain the most SFPs for all datasets except for the SISY—RIPC—
seq and SISY—Pairs—nonseq groups. Because it would seem to be very
difficult to match runs of 3 or more low RMSD pairs purely by
chance, these results strongly suggest that the Kpax alignments con—
tain more conserved structural regions than the 3DCOMB and Matt
alignments, and indeed more than many of the reference alignments.
More certainly, the results in Table 3 show that high M—scores are
highly correlated with high numbers of SFPs, core residues, aligned
pairs and low RMSDs. Therefore, these results demonstrate the

utility of the M—score as a measure of MSA quality. Nonetheless,
since current high quality alignments can still contain distance viola—
tions, a useful future extension could be to add a term to penalize
such occurrences.

It is worth mentioning that Kpax is considerably faster than
3DCOMB and Matt. Aligning the 77 SISY—Families MSAs using
Kpax takes around 13 minutes for rigid alignments and 17minutes
for ﬂexible alignments on a workstation with eight E5410 2.3 GHz
processors and 12Gb memory. In comparison, 3DCOMB takes
49 minutes for its rigid alignments and Matt takes 200 minutes for
both rigid and ﬂexible alignments.

3 Conclusions

This article has described a novel approach for calculating ﬂexible
protein SAs by recursively dividing a DP scoring matrix into mul—
tiple boxes. Each box of the DP matrix corresponds to a rigid SA
sub—problem. This allows ﬂexible SAs to be calculated almost as eas—
ily as rigid alignments. This approach is easily extended to calculat—
ing ﬂexible MSAs by ﬂexibly aligning each mobile structure onto an
automatically selected rigid pivot.

This article has also described the M—score, a novel Gaussian—
based measure of MSA quality. The results presented for three large
benchmark datasets show that high M—scores correspond to SAs
with high numbers of aligned pairs with low RMSD. These results
show that Kpax, Matt and 3DCOMB generally produce SAs with
more aligned pairs, residue identities and aligned fragments than are
present in the Homstrad, SABmark and SISY reference alignments.
It has also been shown that the rigid SAs from Matt and 3DCOMB,
as well as several reference datasets, can contain a high proportion
of pair—wise distances that exceed 8 A, indicating the presence of sig—
nificant alignment errors. While the flexible SAs produced by Matt
are free of distance violations, these SAs are often much shorter than
those produced by Kpax. In contrast, the full—length Kpax ﬂexible
SAs contain more residue identities and structurally aligned frag—
ments than the Matt SAs, while still showing few distance violations
and reduced RMSDs. Overall, these results show that high quality
SAs may be achieved when structural flexibility is properly taken
into account, and they support the utility of the M—score as a meas—
ure of MSA quality.

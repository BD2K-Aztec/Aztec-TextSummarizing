Reconstructing ANcestral GEnomeS maps

 

(Bergeron et al, 2008; Schmidt and Stoye, 2004).
Markers missing in some extant genomes, due for example to
gene loss, are a major issue, especially when considering a large
number of extant genomes (Gavranovic et al, 2011). To address
this issue, ANGES implements several methods to post—process
ACS in order to account for missing markers, which are
described in detail in the ANGES manual. ANGES can, for
example, handle whole—genome duplications, possibly followed
by massive gene loss (Chauve et al, 2010; Gavranovic et al,
2011).

Ancestral genome maps are then computed from the set of
ACS by selecting a subset of these ACS that satisﬁes the C1P
(for multichromosomal linear genomes) or the circular C1P (for
unichromosomal circular genomes). ANGES computes such
subsets of ACS using a greedy heuristic deﬁned in Ma et a].
(2006), a branch—and—bound algorithm or a spectral seriation al—
gorithm (Atkins et al, 1998) (the latter method is a new feature
that was not described in our previous articles). Ancestral
genome maps are represented by the PQ—tree data structure [mul—
tichromosomal linear genomes, see Chauve and Tannier, 2008)]
or the related PC—tree (circular genomes). The ability to compute
circular ancestral genome is an important new feature of
ANGES with respect to our previous works that considered
only eukaryotic ancestral genomes. ANGES permits the use of
C1P variants, such as the sandwich—ClP (Gavranovic et al,
2011), by translating ACS into a correlation matrix that is
used as input to a spectral seriation algorithm or the C1P with
multiplicity that can include information about telomeric ACS
(Chauve et al, 2011).

The methods implemented by ANGES are predictive and in
most cases cannot be assessed against true results, as ancestral
genomes at the evolutionary scale of tens or hundred millions of
years are unavailable. Some speciﬁc ancestors, regarded as
references by the genomics and cytogenetics communities, have
been used to assess the accuracy of ancestral genome reconstruc—
tion methods, such as the boreoeutherian or saccharomyces
ancestors [see (Chauve and Tannier, 2008; Chauve et al,
2010)]. Comparison with simulations (Ma et al, 2006),
robustness studies (Ouangraoua et al, 2011) or statistical sup—
port of local features (Ma et al, 2006) has also been reported.
Probably more useful, the number of discarded ACS to satisfy
the C1P is a good indicator of the conﬂicting nature of the
conserved synteny signal that deﬁnes ACS. For all the ancestors
reported using the methods implemented in ANGES, we could
observe a very low conﬂicting signal with well under 5% of ACS
discarded.

3 IMPLEMENTAHON

The general principle of our implementation is that every com—
putational step is implemented into a single Python script, which
takes as input a set of text files and computes, as output, a set of
text files. Hence, the Python scripts that compose ANGES can
be organized into a complete ancestral genome computation
pipeline or can be used as stand—alone scripts. ANGES contains
efﬁcient implementations for generic tasks in comparative gen—
omics such as computing common intervals and checking several
variants of the C1P on binary matrices. In some cases, it is, as far
as we know, the ﬁrst available implementation of recent

algorithms (Bergeron et al, 2008; Chauve et al, 2011;
McConnell, 2004).

To use the ANGES scripts into an ancestral genome map
computation pipeline, ANGES contains a ‘master script’ that
reads the input ﬁles (markers and species tree, as well as possible
optional ﬁles) and a ‘parameters file’ that records all user—deﬁned
choices that can be made regarding data processing. A simple
graphical interface is provided to generate, read and modify par—
ameters ﬁles.

Running times can vary depending on the nature of data and
the ancestral map computation methods. The examples provided
with the distribution have all completed within a few minutes on
a bi—processor desktop computer. Larger datasets we analyzed,
especially with non—unique markers or using the branch—and—
bound method, required up to 2 days of computation.

4 FUTURE\NORK

In the next release, we will include alternative methods to com—
pute ancestral genome maps from ACS, and in particular an
extension of the greedy heuristic for the sandwich—ClP frame—
work. We will also include methods to compute ancestral
genome structures that do not rely on the notion of contiguity
but on the less rigid notion of conserved synteny, as described in
Ouangraoua et a]. (2011). And we are working on allowing mul—
tichromosomal genomes with circular and linear chromosomes,
to be able to handle in a single framework all known genome
forms in the living world. We are also integrating the possibility
to provide gene families trees as input.

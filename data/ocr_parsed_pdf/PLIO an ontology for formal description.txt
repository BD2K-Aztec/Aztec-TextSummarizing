ABSTRACT

Motivation: Biomedical ontologies have proved to be valuable tools
for data analysis and data interoperability. Protein—ligand interactions
are key players in drug discovery and development; however, existing
public ontologies that describe the knowledge space of biomolecular
interactions do not cover all aspects relevant to pharmaceutical
modelling and simulation.

Results: The protein—ligand interaction ontology (PLIO) was
developed around three main concepts, namely target, ligand
and interaction, and was enriched by adding synonyms, useful
annotations and references. The quality of the ontology was
assessed based on structural, functional and usability features.
Validation of the lexicalized ontology by means of natural
language processing (NLP)-based methods showed a satisfac-
tory performance (F-score=81%). Through integration into our
information retrieval environment we can demonstrate that PLIO
supports lexical search in PubMed abstracts. The usefulness of PLIO
is demonstrated by two use-case scenarios and it is shown that
PLIO is able to capture both confirmatory and new knowledge from
simulation and empirical studies.

Availability: The PLIO ontology is made freely available to the public
at http://www.scai.fraunhofer.de/bioinformatics/down|oads.html.

1 INTRODUCTION

Biological and medical ontologies are formal representations
of biomedical knowledge. They have been proved to be very
useful for the communication of biomedical information through
controlled vocabularies, deﬁnitions and proper metadata annotation
(Bodenreider et (11., 2005; Rubin et (11., 2008). Numerous examples
have demonstrated their value for data-mining and knowledge-
discovery approaches. Ontologies have been used for automated
reasoning (Heja et (11., 2008), for large-scale annotation of entire

genomes (Thomas et (11., 2003; Ashbumer et (11., 2000), for data
mining in microarray data (Whetzel et (11., 2006), for prediction of
biomolecular interactions (Yoshikawa et (11., 2004) and for semantic
and ontological search in unstructured information sources such as
scientiﬁc text (Doms and Schroeder, 2005; Spasic et (11 ., 2005; http://
www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html).

The biological domain has developed a large portfolio of
widely accepted and widely used ontologies (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/
ontology-lookup/) including gene ontology (Ashbumer et (11 ., 2000),
the sequence ontology (Eilbeck et (11 ., 2005) and the microarray gene
expression database ontology (Whetzel et (11., 2006). In parallel,
the medical sector has generated its own portfolio with, e.g. the
foundational model of anatomy (Rosse et (11., 2003), SNOMED
(Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine; Spackman et (11., 1997)
and ICD (International Statistical Classiﬁcation of Diseases and
Related Health Problems; http://www.who.int/classiﬁcations/icd/
en/). However, relevant knowledge in the pharmaceutical sector has
not yet been addressed by the public scientiﬁc community. Some
proprietary efforts to organize the knowledge relevant for pharma
industry exist. To our state of knowledge, the BioWisdom pharma
ontology (Broekstra et (11., 2004; http://www.biowisdom.com/20l0/
04/metawise/) is the only ontological resource representing a
substantial part of the pharma world. This proprietary ontology
comprises substantial evidence (extracted from literature) and
incorporates a broad spectrum of public sources. In fact, a good part
of the BioWisdom ontology underlying their ontology framework
is taken from public ontologies. However, these public ontologies
are organized in a way that new options for ontology alignment and
reasoning are created.

Motivated by the public—private research project ‘Neuroallianz’,
a nationally ﬁinded project on joint academic—industrial drug
discovery and development in the area of dementia (http://www
.bmbf.de/en/10540.php), we have started to develop an ontology
representing knowledge about protein—ligand interactions. With this
article, we present ‘protein—ligand interaction ontology’ (PLIO).
PLIO is representing knowledge about the interaction of proteins and
ligands (including drugs) and has a different scope and conceptual
resolution than the molecular interaction ontology (Cote et (11.,
2006). An important feature of PLIO is that it links directly from
an ontology framework describing protein—ligand interactions to
the mathematical formulas relevant for the computation of some
of the entities represented in the ontology. To our knowledge, this
is the ﬁrst example for an ontology, which directly links from a

knowledge representation to the mathematical building blocks that
describe the leaves of the ontology in mathematical terms. It is
noteworthy that although we have adopted the top-level formal
ontology structure during the construction of PLIO, our attempt was
concentrated on keeping the concept deﬁnitions close to expressions
in natural language. Thus, the hierarchical structure of the ontology
can serve as a robust navigation tree for terminology integration and
text-mining applications.

2 METHODS

PLIO was constructed according to the ontology building life cycle (Gomez-
Pérez at (11.. 2004). To be compliant with the construction of formal
ontologies. we followed the principle criteria of the top-level ontologies
using the basic formal ontology upper level concepts (Grenon at (11.. 2004).
The Protege OWL editor was used for building the ontology in Ontology
Web Language (OWL) format (http://protege.stanford.edu/~overview/).

Scope and domain coverage of the PLIO was deﬁned by answering to a
set of competency questions (cf. Supplementary Table Sl). These questions
capture different levels of complexity that the ontology must represent and
are used to identify the key concepts and relationships between them.

2.1 Knowledge acquisition and conceptualization

Concepts were extracted from the UMLS web browser (Uniﬁed Medical
Language System; http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/). International
Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) gold book (http://goldbook
.iupac.org/). International Union of Pharmocology Committee on Receptor
Nomenclature and Drug classiﬁcation (Neubig at (11.. 2003). glossary of
terms used in medicinal chemistry (IUPAC recommendations; Wermuth
at (11.. 1998). web search and the proteiniprotein interaction ontology (http://
bioportal.bioontology.org/Visualize/39508). With the help of competency
questions. a set of main concepts was identiﬁed and corresponding
relationships between the parent and children classes were established.
Each entity includes a speciﬁc description including name. synonym(s).
reference(s) andiwhen appropriateimathematical formula(s) as well as
links to relevant web services which might be available for the computation
of values for the entity.

2.2 Terminology analysis and concept enrichment

Transformation of the ontology OWL format into a dictionary ﬁle was
achieved using a Java program. The program extracts the concept names and
the corresponding synonyms from the ontology OWL structure and assigns
unique identiﬁers to each concept. This dictionary was incorporated into
ProMiner. our named entity recognition software (Fluck at (11.. 2007). In
a subsequent step. the major super-class concepts were used as keywords
for search in PubMed and from the result list of each concept search.
several abstracts were chosen randomly. After compiling all abstracts. a
corpus of 500 PubMed abstracts with informative contents about proteini
ligand interaction was formed and randomly divided into a training set
(250 abstracts). which was used for extracting the terminology manually
and building the dictionary. and an annotation set for developing the gold
standard (250 abstracts). From the latter. a test set of 100 abstracts was
selected. In order to create the reference gold standard. suitable annotation
guidelines were developed so that the annotator is guided to keep the breadth
and depth of the ontology in mind and to consider not only the super-
class concepts but also their corresponding sub-class concepts as well as
their synonyms for annotation; for example. the term ‘hydrogen bond” (a
synonym of hydrogen bonding) is annotated under the class ‘interaction type”
as it is the subclass of the class ‘non-bonded interaction” which is itself the
subclass of the class ‘intermolecular interaction” which is itself the subclass
of the class ‘interaction type” The following classes were chosen for manual
annotation: ligand-binding site. interaction simulation. interaction detection.

interaction type. ligand activity. ligand-binding site property. ligand complex.
and thermodynamics of proteiniligand interactions. These classes cover the
scope of the PLIO and represent its main concepts.

Using these annotation guidelines. both training and test sets were
manually annotated by means of the Knowtator tool (http://knowtator
.sourceforge.net/). For enrichment purposes (optimizing the dictionary). the
training set was analysed for false-negative entities. whichiafter individual
expert evaluationiwere added to the PLIO terminology. The test set served
as the gold standard set as well. because the evaluation process requires the
performance comparison between the automatically and manually annotated
text from the same set.

2.3 Evaluation

PLIO was assessed for its structural and functional features using the NeON
Toolkit (http://www.neon-toolkit.org/) and AgreementMaker (Cruz at (11..
2009).

To evaluate the quality of the ontology in terms of measuring the
boundaries of the knowledge domain it captures. precision. recall and F -score
values were calculated. These values were computed based on the longest
string match found between automatically annotated words by ProMiner. and
the (human) gold standard annotation for each abstract in the selected corpus.
The following formulas were used for the computation of recall. precision
and F -score values (Morgan at (11.. 2008):

True positives

Precision = 
True posmves + false posmves

True positives
Recall: —. . . .
True posmves + false negatives
Precision >< recall
F — score = 2. H—
Precislon + recall
where true positives are the number of entities that were found by ProMiner
and that matched the annotation in the gold standard; false positives are the
number of entities that were (automatically) annotated by ProMiner but could
not be matched to annotations in the (expert annotated) gold standard and
false negatives are the number of entities that were not found by ProMiner

when compared with the manual gold standard annotation.

2.4 Visualization of concepts through the text

To Visualize the named entities embedded in the ontology. PLIO was
integrated into our SCAIView software (Friedrich at (11.. 2008). SCAIView
is a Visualization interface for ProMiner annotations and displays named
entities by markup of the text (e.g. PubMed abstracts). The key feature of
SCAIView is the possibility to perform ontological search in biomedical
text using concept hierarchies and synonyms associated with each concept
in PLIO. For use of PLIO in SCAIView. the hierarchical organization of the
ontology was preserved by transforming the ontology OWL ﬁle into XML
format.

3 RESULTS
3.1 PLIO structure and contents

PLIO captures a wide range of key concepts speciﬁc to the
knowledge domain of protein—ligand interaction including
forces that govern the protein—ligand complex formation
(e.g. van der Waals and electrostatics), interaction descriptors
(e.g. pharmacophore and interaction ﬁngerprint), interaction
detection methods (e.g. nuclear magnetic resonance and X-ray),
methods by which protein—ligand interactions can be simulated
and predicted (e.g. molecular dynamics and docking), classiﬁcation
of ligand activities (e.g. biological activity and binding activity),
classiﬁcation of ligand modes of action (e.g. agonist and inhibitor),

classiﬁcation of binding sites (e.g. allosteric site and orthosteric
site), and structure—activity relationships (e. g. QSAR and COMFA).

The high-level semantic framework of PLIO comprises three
basic classes (i.e. protein, ligand and interaction) describing rather
different types of entities (Fig. l).

The ‘protein biological unit” concept reﬂects the complex protein
structure. Sub-classes to this concept describe topological areas
in the protein where a ligand can bind, i.e. ligand-binding site.
This concept captures different categories of ligand-binding sites
found in literature, as well as chemical and geometrical properties
of the ligand-binding site. It was included in PLIO because small
molecules (ligands; drugs) can bind to and speciﬁcally interact with
ligand-binding sites so that a certain biological response or a chain
of biological events is triggered as a result.

Normally, the outcome of an interaction between a ligand and
its biological target(s) is determined by the potential of the ligand
to induce a certain type of activity upon binding to its target (e.g.
biological activity, binding activity and intrinsic activity). Therefore,
the ‘activity’ concept was included in PLIO to capture speciﬁc
features of the ligand to induce such activities.

The ‘biological activity” concept encompasses structure—activity
relationships (Fig. 2) but it is also important to characterise a ligand
in terms of its ability to generate and reproduce a response, and
for this reason ‘intrinsic activity” and ‘efﬁcacy’ were included.
The concept ‘binding activity” characterises those features that
are important for ligand binding to a certain protein (e.g. afﬁnity,
speciﬁcity, selectivity and cooperative binding).

The concept ‘interaction’ reﬂects the main features and different
interaction types occurring between protein and ligand upon
binding, and techniques by which protein—ligand interactions can be
detected and simulated. Prediction of an interaction is represented

by the ‘interaction detection” and the ‘interaction simulation”
concepts respectively. Additionally, the interaction concept captures
different chemoinformatic descriptors such as ‘pharmacophore’ and
‘structural interaction ﬁngerprint”, as well as interaction descriptors
(electrostatic, quantum chemical, thermodynamics, geometrical,
constitutional and topological descriptors).

For the sake of ontology completeness, concepts reﬂecting
physical interactions have been annotated with their corresponding
formulas and web services in addition to the common annotation
ﬁelds (reference, synonym list and deﬁnition). The purpose is
to hyperlink appropriate ontology leaves to online mathematical
equations and/or web services that compute the corresponding
functions. Figure 3 illustrates the ontology concept ‘Kf (equilibrium
dissociation constant) annotated with its mathematical foundation
(formulas ﬁeld) and relevant software/web service (software ﬁeld)
through which users can access the link and calculate Kl- online. The
entire ontology consists of 375 entities interlinked by 10 semantic
relation types (Table 1).

In case that a sub-class could be related to more than one
super-class, multiple-inheritance connections were introduced; for
example, if both ligand-binding site and ligand have aromatic
rings, a It-stacking interaction is possible between them. As
physicochemical properties characterise both protein-binding site
and the corresponding ligand, multiple inheritances were established
between these two concepts by means of the following relationships:

ligand ‘has a” physicochemical properties;
ligand ‘has a” surface property;

ligand ‘has a” volume property and

3.2 PLIO evaluation

Assessment of the quality of PLIO was based on both structural and
ﬁinctional criteria. Table 2 summarises the structural features of the
ontology.

Analysis of PLIO using the XD analysis tool (eXtereme Design
annotation tools; http://neon-toolkit.org/wiki/XDTools) veriﬁed that
each entity is related at least to one other entity through some
ontology axiom (i.e. no isolated entity), each entity is the instance
of something (i.e. no missing type), and there is no intersection of
classes in the domain or range of properties. We further evaluated
the boundaries of the knowledge domain addressed by our ontology
through aligning it with the two closest related ontologies, small-
molecule ontology (SMO; Choi et (11., 2010) and drug interaction
ontology (DIO; Yoshikawa et (11., 2004). Using a parametric string
matcher algorithm, it could be shown that PLIO covers topics not
previously captured by existing ontologies. At the same time, the low
percentages of overlap between PLIO and these ontologies implies
that PLIO has still maintained its coherence to the neighbouring
knowledge domains (Table 3).

In comparison, SMO does not capture the features responsible
for molecular recognition events and D10 ignores intra- and inter-
molecular forces that govern the interactions between molecules.

To set the scope of the PLIO ontology, three competency
questions were sketched. Answering the competency questions
requires sufﬁcient ontological coverage to capture the concepts of
the domain (Supplementary Table S1).

After enrichment analysis of the training set (see Section 2), 8l
concepts were enriched with synonyms and 25 new concepts were
added to the PLIO.

namely SMO and D10

Thresholds have been manually optimized for obtaining the highest overlap between
source and target concepts through the increase of recall.

Independent test set of 100 abstracts 0.94 0.72 0.8154

 

The terminology behind PLIO supports l32l synonyms (on
average 3.5 synonyms per concept). Evaluation of the terminology
showed a satisfactory performance on an independent test corpus of
100 Medline abstracts (Table 4).

3.3 Usability proﬁle

PLIO provides users with 1051 entity annotation axioms for all
instances and classes. The coverage of relevant information in the
ontology has been increased by adding 75 formula annotations
and several software hyperlinks. Through integration of PLIO in
SCAIView (Friedrich et (11., 2008), we could make the ontology
easily navigable as a tree and, at the same time, visualize the markup
of PLIO concepts tagged in PubMed abstracts.

3.4 Use cases

There are numerous publications that either report on ﬁndings
generated by simulation of protein—ligand interactions (e.g. docking
and molecular dynamics simulations), or report on empirical
experiments testing protein—ligand interactions in binding assays
and other biochemical tests. PLIO—when used for semantic
annotation of PubMed abstracts—can be employed to systematically
screen the published knowledge and, for example, compare
simulation-based and empirical knowledge on protein—ligand
interactions. In the following use-case scenarios, we demonstrate
that PLIO can be used to ﬁnd conﬁrmatory statements (i.e.
protein—ligand interaction simulation experiments conﬁrm empirical
ﬁndings), or statements that indicate that, for example, through
simulation new insights can be gained beyond the state of knowledge
resulting from empirical experiments (and vice versa).

3.4.1 HIV-I protease ﬂaps The human immunodeﬁciency virus
type 1 aspartic protease (HIV1 protease) is a protein produced
by HIV virus and the major drug target for acquired immune
deﬁciency syndrome (AIDS) therapy. For development of potent
inhibitors against HIV virus, the mechanism of protein—ligand
binding should be understood using experimental and simulation
approaches. In this application scenario, the main focus is HIV-1
protease ﬂaps. HIV protease ﬂaps are ﬂexible and provide an access
to the active site when they are in open conformation (Scott and
Schiffer, 2000). Flaps are responsible for substrate penetration inside
HIV1 protease and product release from the active site (Nicholson
et a1., 1995). PLIO ontological search was used to ﬁnd relevant
knowledge from both simulation and biochemical studies. The
results were manually classiﬁed into conﬁrmatory and information
gain statements extracted from PubMed abstracts using SCAIView
ontological search (Table 5).

Table 5 shows that document retrieval based on PLIO terms
can successfully discriminate between simulation and experimental
knowledge related to HIV-1 protease ﬂaps. In the case of HIV-1
protease ﬂaps, the simulation knowledge is in agreement with the
experimental (biochemical) knowledge represented in a different set
of PubMed abstracts. Accordingly, the simulation results suggest that
the ﬂaps can be in ensemble of conformations between ‘semi-open”,
‘open’ and ‘curled’ conformation. The experimental results strongly

additional information related to the HIV-1 ﬂap region gained from
the results of ontological search. This information can be used
for improved characterization and understanding of HIV-1 protease
ﬂaps and designing successful therapeutic inhibitors.

cyclopentlyladenosine (CPA), N(6)-cyclohexyl adenosine (CHA)
and 2-chloro-N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CCPA) ligands against
adenosine receptors is investigated. The goal is to compare the
experimental and simulation knowledge related to the afﬁnities
of these ligands (Table 6) using PLIO ontological search in

SCAIView. The results indicate that the high afﬁnity of CPA
and CCPA ligands against adenosine receptor 1 is conﬁrmed
by comparing the simulation knowledge from one PubMed
abstract with the biochemical experimental knowledge from
another abstract. The information gain column lists additional
information regarding the interaction of CPA, CHA and CCPA
ligands. It contains information related to interaction preferences
of these ligands with their target-binding sites and electrostatic
similarity features to other ligands. Obviously, the simulation-based
ﬁndings add information that goes beyond what was found using
experimental, biochemical tests.

4 DISCUSSION

Currently, the existing ontologies (e.g. SMO, M10 and D10)
describe molecular interactions at the complex macro-scale level
as a biological event but they do not address the ﬁindamental
physics behind an interaction occurring between a ligand and its
target. Besides differences in scope between PLIO and the ontologies
mentioned above, the main difference lies in the characterization of
interactions between target and ligand. PLIO is a focused ontology in
terms of representing protein—ligand interactions at the micro-scale
level (e.g. electrostatic interaction, van der Waals interaction and
covalent bonding), explicitly representing the major known features
involved in protein—ligand interactions from different points of view
such as biophysics, chemoinformatics, molecular modelling, and
experimental methodology. For example, the interaction concept
in D10 is represented as the event when ligand (an effecter)
interacts with its biological target (objects) and triggers certain
output (biological event). This biological event representation of
interaction, which is present in both D10 and SMO, is another way
to look at the physical interactions between molecules; however, this
kind of representation ignores intra— and inter-molecular forces that
govern the interactions.

In the design of PLIO, special attention has been paid to the
usability proﬁle of the ontology which addresses to what extent
the set of annotations and metadata of the ontology contributes to
its usability and application by end users. For this reason, PLIO
is distinct from other ontologies in providing extra mathematical
and web hyperlink annotations so that quantitative concepts and
parameters can be directly calculated online. When integrated into
our information retrieval system, PLIO leveraged the efﬁciency
of semantic information retrieval and knowledge representation
by providing the possibility to perform ontological search in two
directions: in depth using concepts hierarchy and in breadth utilizing
synonyms associated with each concept. It not only detected the
established knowledge but also allowed for gain of information
which otherwise could not be explicitly detected. This approach
enables users to exploit the added value of gained information for
generation of novel hypotheses.

5 CONCLUSIONS

In combination with text-mining technologies, PLIO and its lexicon
create a powerﬁil ontology-driven search engine which is able to
answer complex questions in the area of protein—ligand interaction.
It facilitates knowledge and information retrieval that helps scientists
to ﬁnd diverse information on a certain drug target or a protein—
ligand complex from simulation and experimental knowledge

scattered throughout the literature. This work represents a ﬁrst
attempt to develop an open, public PLIO and we do not claim that
PLIO covers the entire knowledge in that domain. Thus, like other
ontologies, PLIO needs continuous improvement and is proposed
to the scientiﬁc community as an ontology that is open for further
contribution.

5.1 Outlook

The value of an ontology representing knowledge relevant for
the pharmaceutical drug discovery and development process has
been demonstrated by the commercial success of BioWisdom and
the uptake of their ontology framework in major pharmaceutical
companies. Their ontology, however, remains proprietary and, thus,
will not be widely and openly shared with the scientiﬁc community.
The lack of an open ontology in the pharmaceutical area has
prompted us to start to work on this topic in small, well-deﬁned areas
of knowledge where we feel competent to contribute to the yet-to-
be-generated, large, public pharma ontology. Therefore, we consider
PLIO as an ‘ontology draft” which forms only a small section of the
proposed public pharma ontology. We intend to make this and any
following building block of the proposed pharma ontology freely
available to the public and we invite the scientiﬁc community to
help improving this ontology.

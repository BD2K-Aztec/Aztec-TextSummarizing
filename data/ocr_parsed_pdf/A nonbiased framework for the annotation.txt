ABSTRACT

Motivation: Recent progress in high-throughput sequencing
technologies has largely contributed to reveal a highly complex
landscape of small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs), including novel non-
canonical sRNAs derived from long non-coding RNA, repeated
elements, transcription start sites and splicing site regions among
others. The published frameworks for sRNA data analysis are
focused on miRNA detection and prediction, ignoring further
information in the dataset. As a consequence, tools for the
identification and classification of the sRNAs not belonging to miRNA
family are currently lacking.

Results: Here, we present, Sequuster, an extension of the currently
available Squuster tool to identify and analyze at different levels
the sRNAs not annotated or predicted as miRNAs. This new module
deals with sequences mapping onto multiple locations and permits
a highly versatile and user-friendly interaction with the data in
order to easily classify sRNA sequences with a putative functional
importance. We were able to detect all known classes of sRNAs
described to date using Sequuster with different sRNA datasets.

1 INTRODUCTION

Small silencing RNAs are the best-known Class of non-coding
RNAs (nCRNAs) of 18—30nt in length, involved in gene silencing
by association to the Argonaute family of proteins (Czech and
Harmon, 2011). Recent progress in high-throughput sequencing
technologies has largely contributed to elucidate the remarkable
landscape of sRNAs, revealing new species of sRNAs with unknown
functions. These novel sRNAs are Classiﬁed according to their
position in the genome and putative functions. Nowadays, ﬁve
major groups of sRNAs have been detected: (i) tiRNAs, located
at the transcription initiation site of coding genes (Taft et (11.,
2010); (ii) spli-RNAs, detected at splicing site of transcripts
(Taft et (11., 2010); (iii) tasi-RNAs, associated to gene termini;
(iv) sRNAs derived from tRNA (Haussecker et (11., 2010) and
(v) sRNAs from non-coding RNA regions (Ono et (11., 2011).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

No tools are prepared to cover a complete analysis of data coming
from sRNA sequencing, and the existing ones are only for miRNA
Characterization and prediction. A major Challenging problem using
high-throughput sequencing data is annotation when the sequences
map onto multiple locations. The current frameworks resolve this
situation with heuristic assumptions, including non-consistent data
removal or providing random annotations. This produces biased
results that hamper the discovery and Classiﬁcation of novel sRNAs.
Here, we present Sequuster, a tool for the Characterization of
the non-miRNA sRNA transcriptome. Sequuster is presented as
an extension of Squuster, a pipeline for the Characterization of
miRNAs (Pantano et (11., 2010) and constitutes the ﬁrst framework
giving a completely unbiased Classiﬁcation of non-miRNAs data of
any species. Sequuster permits a user-friendly interaction with the
data at any level in order to easily Classify and annotate small RNA
sequences with a putative functional importance.

2 METHODS

Sequuster. an extension of the miRNA-analysis tool Squuster. has been
developed to analyze any kind of sRNA detected by large-scale sequencing
technologies (see ‘implementation’ in Supplementary Material). The new
framework integrates three speciﬁc processes: (1) raw data processing and
miRNA detection. (2) clustering and (3) classiﬁcation (Fig. 1). In the ﬁrst
process. the adapter is trimmed from the raw sequences. and subsequently
sequences are mapped onto miRNA and miRNA precursor databases. To
avoid the dependency on an external tool for mapping against miRBase
dataset (Grifﬁths-Jones. 2004). a custom algorithm based on seed (fragments
of Snt) indexation has been integrated in Java (see ‘miRNA detection” in
Supplementary Material). miRNAs predicted using an external tool may be
loaded to Sequuster to avoid the incorporation of these sequences to the
study of the non-miRNA sRNA transcriptome. The second step deﬁnes unit-
sRNAs (usRNAs) taking into account two ﬁlters: (i) sequence similarity and
(ii) genome location. In the ﬁrst ﬁlter. all sequences with 100% identity (no
mismatches allowed) and >80% of overlapping are considered as putative
unit small RNA (pre-usRNA). In the second ﬁlter. all pre-usRNAs are
mapped onto a custom genome using megablast (Altschul at (11.. 1990)
or other custom tool. Otherwise. annotated data from any other mapping
tool may be directly uploaded onto Sequuster. This ﬁlter only affects
ambiguously overlapped pre-usRNA and are used to make the decision
on whether or not the two overlapping pre-usRNAs should be considered
a single cluster of sequences (usRNA). In the rest of the cases (unique
sequences or unambiguously mapped clustered sequences). pre-usRNAs are
directly called as usRNAs. The requirement to merge ambiguous overlapped
pre-usRNA into ambiguous usRNA is that all overlapped pre-usRNAs have
to share all the same regions. When the latter does not occur due to more
complex situations. pre-usRNAs enter into an extra module integrating a
recursive algorithm (see ‘decision algorithm” in Supplementary Material).

Fig. 1. Sequuster extension framework scheme. The framework integrates
three speciﬁc processes: (1) raw data processing and miRNA detection,
(2) clustering and (3) classiﬁcation. In the ﬁrst process the adapter is
trimmed from the raw sequences, and subsequently sequences are mapped
onto miRNA and miRNA precursor databases. After that, all sequences
not annotated as miRNAs or miRNA precursors are clustered in clustering
step. This step is performed according to two ﬁlters: (i) sequence similarity
and (ii) genome location. In the classiﬁcation step, usRNAs are classiﬁed
according to the genome context that will cover as many classes and
subclasses as the users deﬁne. Once usRNAs are deﬁned and located on the
genome, all of them are classiﬁed according to the genome context that will
cover as many classes as the users deﬁne, being the more common types:
non-coding RNAs, transposable elements (TES), and genes (see ‘usRNA’
classiﬁcation in Supplementary Material).

3 OUTPUT

The framework generates a main MySQL table for each sample
where rows are usRNAs and columns show the following
information: unique identiﬁer, number of sequences, number of
locations, coordinates and ﬁnally one column for each class,
according to the annotation step: -repeat, -ncRNA, etc (see ‘output
scheme’ in Supplementary Material). For a user-friendly View, BED
ﬁles are generated to be uploaded to UCSC (Kent et (11., 2002).
Furthermore, Sequuster permits differential expression analysis
between two samples or two groups of samples in different
biological contexts. Datasets involving time series experiments may
be also analyzed .

4 RESULTS

We have applied Sequuster extension to analyze small RNA
datasets of human brain samples sequenced by illumina 1G in
our previous work (Marti et (11., 2010) and other public dataset
from different species (see ‘Sequuster application’ to real datasets

in Supplementary Material). First, we detected miRNA sequences
using Squuster with default parameters and the miRBase resource
(Release 15, (Grifﬁths-J ones, 2004)). We applied Sequuster
extension to the rest of the data, resulting in a total of 8335, 12 366,
15 614, 44 265 and 82 985 sequences annotated as usRNAs in human
brain, human stem cells, mouse, ﬂy and worm, respectively.

5 CONCLUSIONS

Differing from the current sRNA analysis tools, the main advantages
of Sequuster framework are as follows: (i) the classiﬁcation and
annotation of the data are not restricted to speciﬁc databases, offering
the possibility to perform this analysis with any custom database;
(ii) the implementation of ﬁlters integrated to solve, in a non-
biased way, the problem of ambiguous sRNAs mapping; (iii) the
opportunity to further study the presumed biogenesis of the sRNAs
and; (iv) the possibility to inspect highly expressed sequences that
have not been successﬁilly classiﬁed allowing the extraction of
complex sRNAs for further analysis. Our results validate Sequuster
as a tool to detect and classify all types of sRNAs in different species,
including the most recently discovered classes of still unknown
function (Taft et (11., 2010).

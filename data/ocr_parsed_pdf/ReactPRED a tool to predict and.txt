Abstract

Motivation: Biochemical pathways engineering is often used to synthesize or degrade target chem—
icals. In silico screening of the biochemical transformation space allows predicting feasible reac—
tions, constituting these pathways. Current enabling tools are customized to predict reactions
based on pre—defined biochemical transformations or reaction rule sets. Reaction rule sets are
usually curated manually and tailored to specific applications. They are not exhaustive. In addition,
current systems are incapable of regulating and refining data with an aim to tune specificity and
sensitivity. A robust and flexible tool that allows automated reaction rule set creation along with
regulated pathway prediction and analyses is a need. ReactPRED aims to address the same.
Results: ReactPRED is an open source flexible and customizable tool enabling users to predict bio—
chemical reactions and pathways. The tool allows automated reaction rule creation from a user
defined reaction set. Additionally, reaction rule degree and rule tolerance features allow refinement
of predicted data. It is available as a flexible graphical user interface and a console application.
Availability and implementation: ReactPRED is available at: https://sourceforge.net/projects/
reactpredl.

1 Introduction

In silica approaches are increasingly being used to predict biochemical
pathways and reactions with an objective to synthesize or degrade
chemicals (Araki et (11., 2015; Nakamura et (11., 2012; Medema et (11.,
2012). The approach is often used to identify xenobiotic degradation
pathways (Wicker et (11., 2016; Gao et (11., 2011; Dimitrov et (11., 2011;
Finley et (11., 2009). Its applicability in predicting pathways for chemical
synthesis is however, a maturing field (Carbonell et (11., 2012; Moura
et (11., 2013; Moriya et (11., 2010). Its evolution is similar to ‘click chem—
istry’ (Kolb and Sharpless, 2003; Durrant and McCammon, 2012).

The current study presents ReactPRED a robust, ﬂexible graph—
ical user interface and a console application. The tool predicts reac—
tions and pathways using biochemical transformation rules or

reaction rules set. It is enabled to create customizable reaction rule
set automatically from an input reaction set. Moreover, the tool is
able to simulate pathways or reactions in a synthetic or retro—
synthetic mode allowing a larger scope of applications for drug me—
tabolism and biochemical engineering.

2 Methods

ReactPRED is a tool enabling reaction rule creation, biochemical re—
action prediction, pathway prediction and analyses. It is a compil—
ation of three independent systems namely, reaction rule creation,
pathway prediction and pathway analysis. Detailed architecture is
represented in the Supplementary Material S1.

Acting on an input reaction set, the reaction rule creation system
extracts all bond rearrangements defining reaction or transform—
ation center along with its neighborhood in SMIRKS notation
(Warner et (11., 2010). Reaction rules are created from the extracted
SMIRKS and stored in a reaction rule library. Identical reaction
rules extracted from different reactions are merged into single rule
(Supplementary Material S2). It should be noted that along with
transformation information the reaction rule library records sub—
strate mass range associated with reaction rules and commonly
occurring co—substrates. Co—substrate selection for a reaction rule is
based on maximum likelihood of molecules participating in reac—
tions defining the reaction rule.

Pathway prediction system simulates and reports reactions and
pathways for input molecules using a reaction rule library. The reac—
tion library is customizable based on a user input reaction set.
Alternatively a default reaction rule library derived from MetaCyc
19.1 (Caspi et (11., 2014) may be used. To detect potential reaction
centers on an input molecule, substructures identical to regions
defined in the reaction rule is identified using an in—house algorithm.
On detection the input molecule is processed in accordance to the re—
action rule (Supplementary Material S3).

Pathway analysis modules allow assessment of the simulation
output. Feasibility of simulated pathways is assessed based on stand—
ard Gibbs free energy derived from group contribution method
(Jankowski et (11., 2008; Noor et (11., 2012). For details please refer,
Supplementary Material S4. Further, outputs are screened on user
defined molecular substructures and mass range (Supplementary
Material S5).

For brevity, discussion on the above mentioned systems are limited
in the manuscript and are extended in the Supplementary Material.

3 Features and results

ReactPRED is implemented in Java 1.7 and uses chemical development
kit (CDK) (Steinbeck et (11., 2006) and Ambit—SMARTS (Jeliazkova and
Kochev, 2011) libraries for processing chemical notations.

A key challenge for reaction prediction system is reporting high
coverage and data enrichment. ReactPRED is enabled by two unique

features, reaction rule degree and prediction tolerance to achieve the
same.

3.1 Reaction rule degree

Reaction rule degree feature describes the neighborhood around the
transformation center detailed within a reaction rule. Zero degree
reaction rule is constructed from only the bonds undergoing re—
arrangement in a reaction. An nth degree rule includes information
from atoms at a distance of 71 atoms from transformation region
(Supplementary Material S2). Increasing neighborhood information
restricts search space and improves prediction specificity (or data en—
richment). Lower reaction rule degree allows exploring a larger
simulation space enhancing prediction sensitivity or coverage.

Effectiveness of the feature was elucidated on a data set of 1381
reactions clustered in 435 reaction groups. Each reaction group
comprised of multiple reactions sharing identical EC number.
Assuming transformation conservation across reactions sharing
identical EC number (Finley et (11., 2009) predictability with change
of reaction rule degree was assessed. For each reaction group a leave
one out experiment was performed by constructing a reaction rule
from one reaction and predicting the others. This is performed with
reaction rule degrees 0—5.

Reaction rule degree inﬂuence on predictions were assessed
based on coverage (C : Z  /N) and enrichment factor
(EF :  /N). For predictions with a reaction rule, rt, rpt and
rpare tota reaction numbers in a group, total predicted reactions
and number of reactions predicted from the group, respectively.
Total number of reaction groups is represented by N. It was
observed that change in reaction rule degree inﬂuenced enrichment
factor and coverage inversely (Fig. 1A). This enables sensitivity and
specificity customization for a simulation (recommended degree is 1,
degree beyond size of molecule is not advised). Manual inspection
suggested that prediction failure with some specific 0 degree reaction
rules was due to diverse transformations within a group.

3.2 Prediction tolerance
Prediction tolerance (Supplementary Material S6) defines the
allowed substrate range for a reaction rule. Prediction tolerance for

ReactPRED: a tool to predict and analyze biochemical reactions

 

a reaction rule is computed and if the input molecule is within a user
defined allowed threshold, it is processed.

Impact of prediction tolerance on coverage and enrichment was
assessed considering the data used to analyze reaction rule degree.
Results are reported in Figure 1B. It was observed that below 0.2,
coverage is significantly compromised (owing to stringent thresh—
old). Default and recommended score is 1. Inﬂuence on enrichment
factor is less significant.

3.3 Click biochemistry

Similar to ‘Click chemistry’ systems, ReactPRED is structured in a
user friendly interface to predict biochemical pathways for chemical
synthesis/degradation. It may be tuned to predict pathways through
interactive or automated approaches. The tool is enabled to perform
systematic searches or explorative searches based on a user
requirement.

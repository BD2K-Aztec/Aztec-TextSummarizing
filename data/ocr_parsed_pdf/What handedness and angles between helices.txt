Abstract

Summary: We have created a new server FoldHandedness. Using this server it is possible: (i) to de—
fine the regions of helices from two issues (from the PDB file and using the last version of the
DSSP program), (ii) to determine the handedness for any chosen three helices and (iii) to calculate
the angle and sign between the chosen pairs of the helices for large proteins and complexes of pro—

teins with DNA or RNA.

Availability and implementation: The FoldHandedness server is available for users at http://bioinfo.

1 Introduction

Recently, the role of a mirror image conformation as a subtle effect
in protein folding has been considered (Kachlishvili et (11., 2014).
The understanding of chirality both in protein structures and amyl—
oid suprastructures is an important issue in molecular biology now
(Rubin et (11., 2008). Chiral amino acids form chiral helices that self—
assemble into structural domains. The left—handed beta helix was a
dogma during 20 years (Jenkins et (11., 1998). It should be noted that
the left—handed beta helix has a more regular structure than the
right—handed helix, and the first may be implicated in the formation
of amyloid aggregates, for example, the prion protein (Choi et (11.,
2009). We are the first who have demonstrated that folding opti—
mization depends not only on the secondary structure but also on
the handedness of ot—helices. Left—handed three—helical domains have
the fastest folding rates in comparison with right—handed three—
helical domains among eight proteins with known experimental
folding rates (Glyakina et (11., 2013). When studying the mechanical
properties of these eight domains, under stretching at a constant
speed and at a constant force on the atomic level, it has been demon—
strated using molecular dynamics simulations that the right—handed
three—helix domains are more resistant mechanically than the left—
handed domains (Glyakina et (11., 2014). We explained this fact by
that the right—handed domains have a larger number of contacts per

residue than the left—handed domains. Moreover, from our analysis
we have revealed that bacterial three—helix proteins have some advan—
tages in packing over eukaryotic right—handed three—helix proteins,
which should result in faster folding (Galzitskaya et (11., 2014).
Identification of protein handedness raises the question how to deter—
mine this value. For some domains this value is not evident. Here, we
present a server able to calculate this value, the packing angle and the
sign between all helices for any large protein consisting of alpha heli—
ces. For prediction of handedness the user should choose a 3D struc—
ture using a standard 4—symbol PDB code or use a home PDB file
from MD simulations and choose three helices from the same chain.

2 Algorithm

The determination of regions of helices is taken from the PDB file
containing the description of the secondary structure or from the
DSSP program (Kabsch et (11., 1983). The user should choose three
helices from the same chain. The axes of the helices are defined as a
vector connecting two points:

1.275 - CW1 + 0.45 . C0,,- + 1.275 . cm,1

coefficients in equation are determined under condition that the cen—
ter mass of the helix calculated by using only C, atoms coincides
with the origin of coordinates and axis Z coincides with the axes of
the helix. The deﬂection from the center does not exceed 0.02  It
is much smaller than the deviations from ideality in the PDB.

We determine the sign of an angle as suggested in the paper
(Chothia et al., 1981): the angle is positive if the near helix is rotated
anti—clockwise relative to the far helix, and it is negative if the rota—
tion is clockwise. To determine this sign we consider three vectors:
bl and h2 are the two helix axis vectors, and d is the vector of the
closest approach in the direction of helix 2 to helix 1. Vector d is
determined as in Chothia et al. (1981). The sign of the angle is deter—
mined as the sign of a scalar triple product (bl >< d)"h2. In the case
of three—helical domain we will consider vector d from the second
helix to the first helix, from the third helix to the second one and
from the third helix to the first one.

We used five points to define the domain handedness: three cen—
ters of helices and two midpoints between corresponding edges of
helices (see description on the server). The first two helical centers
and the midpoint between their edges represent an imaginary plane.
With the third helical center added to the plane these four points
form a torsion angle. Positive and negative signs of this torsion angle
correspond to right— and left—handed proteins. We defined the
Quasi—Torsion angle as an average of forth—propagating and back—
propagating torsion angles, if they have the same sign.

3 The FoldHandedness server

The FoldHandedness web—server is available at http://bioinfo.
protres.ru/foldhandednessl. To calculate handedness with this ser—
ver, one should specify the corresponding PDB entry (in the standard
4—symbol format, for example, PDB entry 3mba). For a protein in
which more than one chain (or in the case of a protein—RNA com—
plex) is presented in the PDB file to be used, one should also specify
which chain should be used. If the studied protein is large it is neces—
sary to choose the corresponding three alpha helices. The server al—
ways defines the regions of helices from two issues: from the PDB
file and using the last version of the DSSP program. In addition,
there is a possibility to calculate the angle and sign between three

4 Implementation

Our program was applied to the dataset of 332 three—helical do—
mains (Glyakina et al., 2013) obtained from the SCOP database
(Andreeva et al., 2008). Two distributions of Quasi—Torsion angles
for the left— and right—handed proteins have been obtained (see
Fig. 2b in Glyakina et al., 2013). At the same time there is no essen—
tial difference in the distribution of interhelical angles between left—
and right—handed protein domains (see Fig. 2).

paralogous gene copies will result in a gene tree that conﬂates
gene duplication with speciation. Similarly, sampled sequence
data that span one or more recombination events will yield
‘gene trees’ that are hybrids of two or more genealogical histories
(Posada and Crandall, 2002). These non—coalescent processes can
strongly inﬂuence phylogenetic inference (Edwards, 2009; Martin
and Burg, 2002; Posada and Crandall, 2002). In addition, Rivera
et al. (1998) showed that an analysis of complete genomes indi—
cated a massive prokaryotic gene transfer (or transfers) preceding
the formation of the eukaryotic cell, arguing that there is signiﬁ—
cant genomic evidence for more than one distinct class of genes.
These examples suggest that the distribution of eukaryotic gene
trees may be more accurately modeled as a mixture of a number
of more fundamental distributions.

In this article, we focus on the problem of identifying signiﬁ—
cant discordance among gene trees, as well as estimating the
distribution of gene trees as a whole. This set of gene trees is
assumed to consist mostly of ‘typical’ (or ‘non—outlier’) gene
trees, which are assumed to be independently sampled from
some distribution f. For example, gene trees have evolved neu—
trally under a coalescent process. In addition, there are a smaller
number of ‘outlier’ gene trees that are sampled from a different
distribution f C These genes are assumed to arise from less—com—
mon evolutionary processes, for example, paralogy, neofunctio—
nalization, horizontal gene transfer or periods of rapid molecular
evolution. In addition, more mundane errorsisuch as incorrect
sequencing, alignment, tree reconstruction or annotationwan
also produce outlier trees in a dataset (Homer and Pesole,
2004). Our method produces a non—parametric estimate of the
distribution f and also attempts to identify potential outlier
gene trees that are probably not generated by f. Trees identiﬁed
as outliers can then be inspected more closely for biologically
interesting properties. In particular, identifying and removing out—
liers that violate model assumptions can improve the accuracy of
inferences made from a collection of gene trees (e.g. Disotell and
Raaum, 2004; Edwards, 2009; Martin and Burg, 2002; Posada
and Crandall, 2002). Note that in this article we use dissimilarity
maps, geodesic distances and topological dissimilarity maps be—
tween trees for simulations and implementation of our software
(see Subsection 2.1.1). With these distance measures between
trees, we implicitly assume a multispecies coalescent model
(Helmkamp et al., 2012). Also note that the choice of tree distance
measures might change the detected outlying gene trees. For ex—
ample, if the subtree pruning and regrafting (SPR) distance be—
tween trees is used, the detected outlier gene trees would be
having an excess of recombinations or horizontal gene transfers.

1.1 Related work

The method presented in this article is not, at its present state of
development, a statistical method for hypothesis testing, but
rather for discovering possible outliers present in a given collec—
tion of orthologous genes. However, there has been significant
work devoted to the development of statistical methods for
testing hypotheses of discordance between the trees in a
collection. The reviewed methods in Poptsova (2009) are the fol—
lowing: (i) likelihood—based tests of tree topologies, such as
KishinoiHasegawa test (Kishino and Hasegawa, 1989),
ShimodairaiHasegawa test (Shimodaira and Hasegawa, 1999)

and approximately unbiased tests (Shimodaira, 2002); (ii) tree
distance methods, such as Robinson and Foulds (1981) and
SPR distances (Goloboff, 2008); and (iii) genome spectral
approaches, such as bipartition (Lockhart et al., 1995) and quar—
tet decomposition analyses (Piaggio—Talice et al., 2004).

The likelihood—based tests of tree topologies and tree distance
methods are statistical hypothesis tests that detect significant in—
congruence between trees, i.e. they are testing the following
hypotheses:

H0: given trees are topologically congruent.
H1: given trees are topologically incongruent.

The distinction between likelihood— and distance—based meth—
ods is in how they calculate the P—value of these hypotheses. The
likelihood—based tests compare each gene tree with a species/
reference tree using a likelihood value to see if the incongruence
is ‘statistically signiﬁcant’. These methods are also known as
partition likelihood support (Lee and Hugall, 2003). Tree dis—
tance methods estimate the P—value of the hypotheses above by
computing a distance between a reference tree and each gene tree.
Holmes (2005) describes a framework for statistical hypothesis
testing on trees based on tree distances using distributions of
phylogenetic trees (e.g. a posterior distribution or bootstrap
resampling). Holmes also presents a statistical method to com—
pare two sets of bootstrap sampling distributions, using the mean
and variance of each distribution (Holmes, 2005; Section 4.4.1).
A non—parametric method for detecting signiﬁcant discordance
between two sets of trees via supporting vector machines was
introduced by Haws et al. (2012). This is a non—parametric
method for statistical testing of the hypotheses:

H0: Two sets of trees are drawn from the same distribution.
H1: Two sets of trees are not drawn from the same
distribution

Although likelihood—based tests assume that the species tree is
known, genome spectral approaches do not use such a reference
tree. Genome spectral methods summarize a set of gene trees
with phylogenetic spectra (frequencies), such as splits or quartets.
These frequencies can be used to approximate the distribution of
gene trees, instead of producing a summarizing tree. Outlier trees
can be identiﬁed by looking for trees whose highly supported
features disagree with prevalent features in the spectra (Nepusz
et al., 2010).

A non—statistical approach for summarizing collections of gene
trees is presented by Nye (2008). Treating each gene tree as a leaf
node, a ‘meta—tree’ is constructed where nodes correspond to
phylogenetic trees; distances between nodes of the meta—tree cor—
respond to distances between phylogenetic trees, and internal
nodes correspond to gene trees with various branches collapsed.
When using the RobinsoniFould distance, the non—parametric
method proposed in this article can be viewed as a numerical
summarization of the meta—tree in (Nye, 2008).

Recently, de Vienne et al. (2012) developed a statistical
non—parametric method to detect outlier trees from the set of
gene trees. They first convert gene trees into vectors in a multidi—
mensional Euclidean space and then apply multiple co—inertia
analysis (MCOA%an extension of principal coordinate ana—
lysisﬁlirectly to these vectorized gene trees. Their method,

PHYLo—MCOA, also detects outlier species, those whose position
varies widely from tree to tree. Included in our results are simu—
lation studies comparing our non—parametric method with
PHYLo—MCOA.

2 METHODS
2.1 Algorithm

Let T" denote the set of all tree topologies (including multifurcating trees)
on n taxa (which we call tree space). We consider trees to be unrooted, but
rooted trees can be treated similarly. Our main object of study is a
sample, {Ti}§v:1, of N trees (gene trees) mostly drawn from a distribution
f on T". If n is large enough that lTnl >> N, then many tree topologies in
the sample may have low empirical frequency. In this case, f cannot be
estimated well by assigning ﬂT) to be the empirical frequency of T in the
sample. On the other hand, if f corresponds to a model such as the co-
alescent, it is reasonable to expect that topologies ‘close’ to many
observed trees will have a higher likelihood than topologies ‘far away’
from the observed trees.

Kernel density estimation is a non-parametric technique to estimate a
distribution that generated a sample, by leveraging the fact that points
close to sample points tend to have higher likelihood than distant outlier
points [underadequate assumptions on the distribution, namely, the distri-
bution is square integrable (Meloche, 1990)]. Kernel density estimation can
be viewed as a reﬁned version of histogram-based estimation of a density.

Given an independent and identically distributed sample of trees
T1, . . ., TN, we propose a non-parametric estimator of the distribution
that generated the sample with the form

A 1 N
oc — k T, T» .
f(T)  ( 1)

Here k, the kernel function, is a non-negative function deﬁned on pairs
of trees, which measures how ‘similar’ two trees are. For our approach,
we do not require k to be a kernel in a strict statistical sense.

In KDETREES, we have implemented a kernel of the form

a
k(T, Tl») oc hiiexp  

A distance function on the space of trees, d(T, T), is used to deﬁne a
univariate projection T" —> [13+ in the natural way for each ﬁxed T e T",
mapping Tr—>d(T, T). The ‘shape’ parameter 8>0 and the ‘bandwidth’
parameters h,»>0 control how tightly each contribution k(T, T,») will be
centered on T,-. Allowing the bandwidth to vary with the sample points,
T,-, is called an adaptive bandwidth method. Alternatively, the bandwidth
can be set to a constant value for all T,-.

In general, we can remove the symmetry and triangle inequality re-
quirements for d, and it is possible that the sum over tree space,
ZTeTMT, T), will vary with T. Ideally, we would remedy this issue
by normalizing k(-, T) so that ZTeTMT, T): 1. (This is the case
most analogous to kernel density estimation.) However, for the d imple-
mented by KDETREES, Monte Carlo estimates of this sum do not appear to
vary signiﬁcantly across T, and so the current version of the software
assumes that it is constant. (Additional information about these estimates
is presented in Supplementary Fig. S1.)

Because the ultimate goal is to detect outlier trees, T, which are not
actually drawn from the true distribution f, we are most concerned with
estimating the density at the observed sample points. In this context, it
makes sense to use a ‘leave-one-out’ estimator that excludes the contri-
bution of the point in question from the tree score,

A _ 1
8(Tj)’ mtg-3kg} Tl)‘

Once we have computed the scores, {gag}, we classify tree T as an
outlier if gm) is less than Q1 — K - IQR. Where Q1 and IQR are the ﬁrst
quartile and the interquartile range of the set of tree scores, respectively,
and K is a classiﬁcation tuning parameter. The choice of K affects the
sensitivity and speciﬁcity of the classifier and is set to 1.5 by default as
deﬁned by J. Tukey for finding outliers (Tukey, 1977), although the users
may supply their own value.

2.1.] Choice of tree distance In our approach, trees can be
incorporated into a statistical framework by converting them into a
numerical vector format based on a distance matrix or map. These
vectorized trees can then be analyzed as points in a multidimensional
space where the distance between trees increases as they become more
dissimilar (Graham and Kennedy, 2010; Hillis et al., 2005; Semple and
Steel, 2003).

For the choice of d, we propose distances derived from three different
distances on trees: dissimilarity map dd, topological dissimilarity map d,
and geodesic distance dgm. The dissimilarity map distance measure be-
tween two trees is the Euclidean distance, dd(T, T): ||vd(T) — vd(T)||2,

n

where vd(T) is a vectorization of trees, T" —> [13(3), based on an enumer-
ation of the pairwise distances between the tips (Buneman, 1971). The
topological dissimilarity map distance measure between two trees is
deﬁned similarly, d,(T, T) = ||v,(T) — v,(T)| lz, but uses a vectorization v,
(T) that counts the number of edges between the tips (Steel and Penny,
1993). An example calculation of both v,, and v, is shown in
Supplementary Figure S2.

Billera et al. (2001) showed that the space of rooted trees with a ﬁxed

1)

number of taxa is the union of positive cones in [130. Thus, the space of
trees is the set of all metrics derived from valid trees and is a subspace of
the space of all distance matrices. The geodesic distance dg is the shortest
distance between two valid trees when the connecting path is constrained
within this tree space (note that this subspace of valid trees is not
itself Euclidean). Owen and Provan (2011) developed an 0(n4) algo-
rithm to compute the geodesic distance dg(T, T) between any two valid
trees.

2.1.2 Missing taxa It is desirable for phylogenetic analyses to be
able to deal with situations with incomplete data. In this case, the
most relevant type of missing data is when some gene trees are missing
a tip that is present in other trees in the dataset. Our method is capable
of handling such a situation if the dissimilarity or topological distance
maps are used. In this situation, we impute missing tip-to-tip distances in
the tree vectors with the median value found in trees containing the
missing tip. Unfortunately, the geodesic distance algorithm we used
does not currently allow us to perform such an imputation, and so
KDETREES cannot handle missing tips if the geodesic distance map is
selected.

If the trees have node labels that correspond to support for the given
split (obtained, for example, by a bootstrap analysis), then the software
can accommodate this information by collapsing nodes with support less
than a given value. This behavior is disabled by default.

2.1.3 Kernel bandwidth The estimator g‘ depends crucially on the
choice of the bandwidth parameter h. We use a nearest-neighbor ap-
proach to estimate an adaptive bandwidth for each sample point. To
estimate the bandwidth for a point T, we use the distance to the m-th
closest sample point. This approach has the effect of causing the kernels
to be concentrated in areas where there is a lot of data and diffuse in the
tails of the distribution. In the current version of KDETREES, m is defaulted
to be 20% of the sample size, a heuristic value chosen based on simula-
tion results.

Alternatively, the bandwidth can be set to a constant value for all T,-.
To do this, we must ﬁnd a way to choose an optimal value for the
bandwidth h. We experimented with a constant bandwidth chosen by

kdetrees

 

estimating the partition function Z), = ZTgh(D using a random sample
of trees. However, it seems that we tend to underestimate the bandwidth
h, and the results are not as robust as in the case of the adaptive
bandwidth.

2.1.4 Tuning parameters The outlier classiﬁer’s sensitivity depends
on the choice of a tuning parameter, K. The default value, 1.5, is chosen
for historical reasons. In our simulations, smaller values of K, ~0.7571,
often resulted in false-positive rates (FPRs) close to 5%. Creating plots of
the tree scores may be helpful in choosing an appropriate value for a
given dataset.

2.1.5 Computational complexity The running time of KDETREES is
dominated by the step where pairwise tree distances are calculated. For N
trees, each with n taxa, this step takes 0(n2N2) operations when using the
dissimilarity or topological distances or 0(n4N2) if using the geodesic
distance.

2.2 Simulations

We conducted a series of simulations comparing the performance of
KDETREES and PHYLo-MCOA. (Code and documentation for the simula-
tions is included in a package vignette with KDETREES.) The simulated data
consisted of coalescent trees generated by the Python library DendroPy
(Sukumaran and Holder, 2010). Six species trees (see Supplementary Fig.
S3) were used to contain coalescent gene trees. A dataset consisted of a
small number of ‘outlier’ gene trees, together with a larger number of
‘non-outlier’ gene trees. Pseudocode in Algorithm 1 summarizes the simu-
lation processes.

 

Algorithm 1: Summary of the simulation comparing KDETREES and
PHYLo-MCOA. (See Supplementary Figure S3 for a plot of the species
tree used.) For the “single” simulations, S contains a single tree (top
left of Figure S3), while for the “mixed” simulations it contained 5 trees
(remainder of Figure S3). For our simulations, 7‘ = 1 and g = 100.

Generate r random outlier gene trees, each within a new random
species tree;
Analyze data with both KDETREES and PHYLo-MCOA;
Tally true and false outlier identiﬁcations for each method;

end

 

Our ﬁrst simulation investigated the classiﬁcation characteristics of the
methods, producing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves com-
paring KDETREES and PHYLo-MCOA, by varying the classiﬁcation tuning
parameter of each method. [An ROC curve is a graphical plot of the
fraction of true-positive rate versus the fraction of FPR at various thresh-
old settings (Hastie et al., 2009).] In this simulation, we set the effective
population size of the coalescent process generating the trees to 2000, a
value that produced a moderate amount of variance in the generated
coalescent trees.

A second simulation compares the true-positive rates of the methods as
the variance of the coalescent trees increases. (Variance of the random
trees is controlled by the coalescent population parameter.) This simula-
tion was performed both with the default classiﬁcation tuning values, as
well as values chosen based on the ROC simulation results to limit the
FPR to ~5%.

A third simulation compared the distribution of outlier tree scores with
the distribution of non-outlier tree scores. The simulation process is sum-
marized in the pseudocode in Algorithm 2.

2.3 Biological datasets

2.3.1 Apicomplexa The Apicomplexa dataset presented by Kuo et al.
(2008) consists of trees reconstructed from 268 single-copy genes from the
following species: Babesia bovis (Brayton et al., 2007; GenBank accession
numbers AAXTOlOOOOOliAAXTOl000013), Cryptosporidium parvum
(Abrahamsen et al., 2004) from CryptoDB.org (Heiges et al., 2006),
Eimeria tenella from GeneDB.org (Hertz-Fowler et al., 2004),
Plasmodium falciparum (Gardner et al., 2002) and Plasmodium vivax
from PlasmoDB.org (Bahl et al., 2003), Theileria annulata (Pain et al.,
2005) from GeneDB.org (Hertz-Fowler et al., 2004) and Toxoplasma
gondii from Toxo-DB.org (Gajria et al., 2008). A free-living ciliate,
Tetrahymena thermophila (Eisen et al., 2006), was used as the
outgroup. To this set of sequences, we appended the Set8 gene, which
has been identiﬁed by Kishore et al. (2013) as a probable case of hori-
zontal gene transfer from a higher eukaryote to an ancestor of the
Apicomplexa.

2.3.2 Epichloe Another set of biological sequences to use as a test case
was generated from housekeeping genes and a known pair of paralogs in
Epichloe species and related plant symbionts and parasites in the fungal
family Clavicipitaceae. We previously reported sequencing, annotation
and the identiﬁcation of orthologs in genome of Epichloe amarillans
strain E57, Epichloe brachyelytri E4804, Epichloe festucae strains E2368
and F11, Epichloe glyceriae E277, Epichloe poae E5819, Epichloe typhina
E8, Aciculosporium take MAFF-241224, Claviceps fusiformis PRL 1980,
Claviceps paspali RRC-l48l , Claviceps purpurea 20.1, Neotyphodium gan-
suense e7080 and Periglandula ipomoeae IasaFl3 (Schardl et al., 2013).
We compiled the inferred protein sequences for 10 housekeeping proteins,
namely, y—actin (ActG), DNA lyase (ApnB), a calmodulin-dependent
protein kinase (CpkA), the largest and second largest subunits of RNA
polymerase II (rpbA and rpbB), translation elongation factor l—oz (TefA),
a-tubulin (paralogs TubB and TubC) and ﬁ-tubulin (paralogs TubB
and TubP). As a possible phylogenetic outlier, we used an alignment of
proteins related to the Emericella nidulans O-acetylhomoserine (thiol)
lyase enzyme (CysD). In some, but not all, of the fungal strains we
analyzed, the CysD homologs were located in the loline alkaloid biosyn-
thesis gene cluster and have been designated LolC (Schardl et al., 2013).
Analysis by OrthoMCL (Li et al., 2003) grouped all of the CysD-related
proteins as orthologs, whereas further analysis with COCO—CL (Jothi
et al., 2006a) separated LolC from the other CysD-related sequences as
paralogs.

3.2 Biological data results

3 .2.1 Apicomplexa The list of putative outlier genes identified by
KDETREES in the Apicomplexa data is presented in Table 1, with
additional discussion in Supplementary Table S1. When using
either the dissimilarity maps or geodesic distance, our method
identified the same set of putative outlier trees. (The first four
trees identiﬁed as putative outliers are also plotted in
Supplementary Figure S4, and the entire set of estimated scores
are summarized in Supplementary Fig. S5.) These trees all contain
a branch with a length that is far too long in proportion to the other
branches, leading to their identiﬁcation as outliers. Closer inspec—
tion of these trees suggested that they correspond to questionable
sequence alignments, which are likely non—homologues included
due to poor annotation, many involving E. tenella sequences.
Because KDETREES revealed that there were pervasive problems
with the E.tenella sequence data, we removed this species from
the dataset and recreated the phylogenetic analysis as in the
paper by Kuo et al. (2008). With the reduced set of gene trees,
KDETREES identiﬁed a different set of outlier trees, and in this
case, the Set8 gene was selected as the furthest outlying tree.

3.2.2 Epichloe The fungal datasets included alignments of 10
fungal housekeeping proteins, plus an alignment of suspected
paralogs designated LolC and CysD. The LolC/CysD tree was
identified as one of two outliers, the other being the DNA lyase
protein ApnB. Topologically, the LolC/CysD tree differed mark—
edly from the others. However, the topology of the ApnB tree
was similar to the topologies for the other housekeeping proteins,
so its identiﬁcation as an outlier suggested that the ApnB tree
had significantly different relative branch lengths from those of
the other housekeeping protein phylogenies in the analysis.

3.3 Running time

A significant advantage of KDETREES over PHYLo—MCOA is a
significant improvement in computational speed, especially
with larger datasets. Actual KDETREES running times are well
ﬁtted by a 0(N2) curve, as suggested by the complexity of the
algorithm discussed previously, whereas the PHYLo—MCOA times
are 0(N3).

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 Simulations

The results of our simulations were generally positive for
KDETREES. Although PHYLo—MCOA was often able to slightly
outperform KDETREES in classiﬁcation accuracy, the difference
was often relatively small. However, in terms of computational
time, KDETREES vastly outperforms PHYLo—MCOA, especially as
the number of trees in the dataset increases.

In all cases studied, methods incorporating branch length in—
formation outperformed the topology—only methods. The per—
formance of the geodesic distance was better in the ‘single’
simulations than the ‘mixed’ simulations, although the reason
for this is unclear. All of the methods were able to correctly
identify the outlier tree when the effective population size (and
thus tree variance) was low, provided that a suitable tuning par—
ameter was chosen. As the variance of the coalescent trees
increased, the performance of PHYLo—MCOA tended to degrade
at a slightly slower rate than KDETREES.

It should be noted that choosing a suitable tuning parameter
can be quite difﬁcult, as the optimal value depends on not only
the details of the dataset but also one’s subjective opinions on the
relative merits of the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of the classiﬁer.
As such, we also studied the behavior of the algorithms when
using their default tuning parameters. This information is rele—
vant, as many users will not change the parameters from their
default values. With these values, we found that KDETREES is
slightly superior to PHYLo—MCOA in the single—distribution
simulations. In the mixed—distribution simulations, the default
values for PHYLo—MCOA resulted in poor performance, whereas
KDETREES’S rate of outlier identification was much higher.

The third simulation set compared the distribution of scores
for outlier trees with the scores of non—outlier trees. Although the
distributions are not completely distinct, it is clear that the outlier
trees tend to have scores smaller than the majority of non—outlier
trees. Because the outlier trees were generated as completely
random coalescent trees, there will inevitably be trees generated
that have structure similar to the non—outlier trees, simply by
chance, and this accounts for some of the overlap between the
distributions. With real data, such trees would correspond to
genes that have some exotic history but nonetheless appear to
have a phylogeny substantially similar to the rest of the genes in
the genome. In this case, it is ambiguous whether such a gene
should be legitimately classiﬁed as an outlier.

The main advantage of KDETREES over PHYLo—MCOA lies in
the vast improvement in running time on datasets with larger
numbers of gene trees. For small datasets, the difference is not
material; however, for datasets with several thousand trees,
PHYLo—MCOA requires many hours to complete, whereas
KDETREES will finish within a few minutes on contemporary com—
modity hardware.

4.2 Biological datasets

4.2.1 Apicomplexa The phylum Apicomplexa contains many
important protozoan pathogens (Levine, 1988), including the
mosquito—transmitted Plasmodium spp., the causative agents of
malaria; T .gondii, which is one of the most prevalent zoonotic
pathogens worldwide; and the water—bome pathogen

 

2285

ﬁm'spzumot‘prqxo'sopnuuowrorq/ﬁdnq

G. Weyenberg et al.

 

Cryptosporidium spp. Several members of the Apicomplexa also
cause significant morbidity and mortality in both wildlife and
domestic animals. Because of their medical and veterinary im—
portance, whole genome sequencing projects have been com—
pleted for multiple prominent members of the Apicomplexa.

The dataset presented in Kuo et al. (2008) consists of 268
orthologous genes from seven species of Apicomplexa and one
outgroup ciliate, T etrahymena thermophelia. To this set of genes,
we appended sequences from the Set8 gene, which has been
identiﬁed by Kishore et al. (2013) as a probable case of horizon—
tal gene transfer from a higher eukaryote to an ancestor of the
Apicomplexa.

Although the Set8 gene was not identiﬁed initially by KDETREES
as an outlier gene, its score was close to the classiﬁcation thresh—
old and is the next gene to be classiﬁed as an outlier if the tuning
parameter is lowered slightly, from 1.5 to 1.3. Because many of
the outliers in the analysis seem to be caused by questionable
annotation in the E.tenella sequences, we removed this species
from the dataset and generated new gene trees. In the new ana—
lysis, the Set8 gene was identiﬁed as the furthest outlier tree.
These results demonstrate the potential applicability of the
KDETREES method to the curation of genetic datasets by providing
a simple tool for highlighting sequences or alignments that may
be of further interest. The successful identification of the Set8
outlier indicates that our method is able to highlight interesting
cases that warrant further attention from investigators.
Moreover, the initial ﬁndings with the E.tenella sequences pre—
sent in the dataset show that KDETREES can be useful for iden—
tifying problematic taxa due to incorrect annotation and/or
inclusion of non—orthologous genes.

4.2.2 Epichlo'e' The application of KDETREES to the set of fungal
protein alignments successfully identiﬁed the paralogous CysD/
LolC alignment as an outlier. This is a scenario that could easily
arise in phylogenomic analysis, where OrthoMCL (Li et al.,
2003) identified the genes as orthologs, although the group was
subsequently broken into separate ortholo g sets by application of
COCO—CL (J othi et al., 2006b) to the OrthoMCL output. The
identiﬁcation of the LolC/CysD alignment as an outlier was in—
dicative of the utility of KDETREES to identify outliers arising from
paralogy.

5 CONCLUSION

The ongoing development of ever—cheaper sequencing methods is
producing a plethora of data suitable for phylogenomic analysis.
One of the great promises of modern genomics is that phylogen—
etics applied at the genomic scale (phylogenomics) should be
especially powerful for elucidating gene and genome evolution,
relationships among species and populations and processes of
speciation and molecular evolution. However, for genomic
data that can now be generated relatively cheaply and quickly,
but for which computationally efﬁcient analytical tools are lack—
ing, there is a major need to explore new approaches to under—
take comparative genomic and phylogenomic studies more
rapidly and robustly than existing tools allow. There is a major
need to explore new approaches to undertake comparative gen—
omic and phylogenomic studies more rapidly and robustly than
existing tools allow.

In simulations and applications to biological data, we address
particular challenges posed by bioinformatic artifacts, as well as
interesting biological phenomena such as gene duplications and
horizontal gene transfer. As we observed in the Apicomplexa and
fungal datasets, our approach also serves as a means of identify—
ing ‘interesting’ gene trees that may arise from horizontal gene
transfer, paralogy or experimental artifacts such as misannota—
tions or misalignments.

A further advantage of our method is that it may be applied in a
straightforward way to phylogenetic reconstruction methods which
produce a sample of many trees as output, rather than a single ‘best
ﬁt’ tree. Methods that produce only a point estimate do not repre—
sent the full set of possible phylogenies compatible with the gene
sequences. We can circumvent this issue by building a kernel for
each gene based on a collection or sample of reconstructed topol—
ogies (e.g. via the estimated posterior distribution of each gene),
rather than using only a point estimate of each gene tree.

In future work, we intend to extend our method to clustering
trees based on similarity, in addition to identifying outliers. The
identiﬁcation and exclusion of outlier points is an important
preliminary step in many clustering methods. The removal of
outlier points facilitates better inference at the clustering stage
(Camastra and Verri, 2005; Hur et al., 2001, 2000).

A long—term goal for this project is to develop a phylogenomic
pipeline that is convenient and accessible, as well as robust. To
accomplish this aim, important problems that need attention are
(i) refinement of gene calls based on comparison among ortho—
logs from multiple genomes and (ii) comparing thousands of
gene phylogenies across whole genomes. Therefore, our ap—
proach is focused on the efﬁciency of the algorithm in terms of
computational complexity and memory requirements, with less
emphasis on achieving the highest classiﬁcation accuracy pos—
sible. Such a trade—off makes our approach more attractive can—
didate for inclusion in a pipeline for genome—wide phylogenetics
as an annotation supplement or as a discovery aid for instances
where evolutionary processes deviate signiﬁcantly from normal.

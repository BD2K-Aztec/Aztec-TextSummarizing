ABSTRACT

Motivation: HIV-1 protease is a key drug target due to its role in
the life cycle of the HIV-1 virus. Rigidity analysis using the software
FIRST is a computationally inexpensive method for inferring functional
information from protein crystal structures. We evaluate the rigidity
of 206 high-resolution (2 or better) X-ray crystal structures of HIV-1
protease and compare the effects of different inhibitors binding to
the enzyme.

Results: Inhibitor binding has little effect on the overall rigidity
of the protein h0m0dimer, including the rigidity of the active site.
The principal effect of inhibitor binding on rigidity is to constrain
the flexibility of the ﬁ-hairpin flaps, which move to allow access to
the active site of the enzyme. We show that commercially available
antiviral drugs which target HIV-1 protease can be divided into
two classes, those which significantly affect flap rigidity and those
which do not. The non-peptidic inhibitor tipranavir is distinctive in its
consistently strong effect on flap rigidity.

1 INTRODUCTION

HIV-1 protease is a key drug target due to its role in the life cycle of
the HIV virus (Erickson, 1995), and many protease inhibitors have
been designed to block its function and to prevent virus replication
(Flexner, 1998). HIV-1 is a retrovirus; after it enters a host cell, its
viral RNA is reverse transcribed into double-stranded DNA and then
integrated into host DNA. The host cell subsequently transcribes this
integrated virus-speciﬁc DNA and translates the transcribed message
into a single extended translation product containing the sequences
of all the viral-encoded proteins required to make further copies
of the virus. The role of HIV-1 protease is to cleave this product
at speciﬁc cleavage sites to generate the individual functional
viral proteins. Successful inhibition of the protease prevents this
maturation step and hence blocks proliferation of the virus.

Many X-ray crystal structures of HIV-1 protease have been
resolved and deposited in the RSCB Protein Data Bank (PDB)
(Berman, 2000). The wild-type protease is a symmetric homodimer
with a largely ﬂ-sheet secondary structure (W lodawer et (11.,
1989). The active site of the protease lies in a cleft where
the two chains meet; this cleft is covered by ﬂ-hairpin ‘ﬂaps’

(Hornak and Simmerling, 2007). Experimentally, nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) (Freedberg et (11., 2001; Ishima et (11., 1999;
Katoh et (11., 2003; Nicholson et (11., 1995) and ﬂuorescence
spectroscopy (Rodriguez et (11., 1993) have been used to study
the ﬂexibility of the protein. The ﬂaps have been found to be
highly ﬂexible in the unbound enzyme, with internal ﬂap motion
occurring on a sub-ns timescale (Freedberg et (11., 2001; Katoh
et (11., 2003). On a timescale of 100 11s, they undergo a different
large amplitude motion in slow dynamic equilibrium between
semi-open and less ordered open conformations (Ishima et (11.,
1999). The conformational dynamics of the protease have also
been investigated using molecular dynamics simulations (Harte and
Beveridge, 1993; Swaminathan et (11., 1991; York et (11., 1993; Zhu
et (11., 2003) and coarse-grained models (Chang et (11., 2006; Tozzini
and McCammon, 2005). Again, the ﬂaps have been found to be
highly ﬂexible with distances between their tips ranging from 7 A
to 25 A (Collins et (11., 1995). The conversion between closed,
semi-open and fully open ﬂaps has been simulated in qualitative
agreement with experimental data (Hornak and Simmerling, 2007;
Homak et (11., 2006).

Here we examine HIV-1 protease by performing rigidity analysis
on a set of 206 X-ray crystal structures that have been solved to a
resolution of 2 A or better and made available in the PDB. In our
analysis, we determine the locations of ﬂexible regions within the
protein and hence study the potential for motion. FIRST identiﬁes
rigid clusters and ﬂexible regions by matching atomic degrees of
freedom with the constraints present due to bonding (Jacobs and
Thorpe, 1995; Jacobs et (11., 2001; Thorpe et (11., 2001). We examine
the effect of inhibitor binding on ﬂap rigidity using a comparative
approach; for each structure crystallized with an inhibitor bound, we
perform rigidity analysis on the structure with the inhibitor present
and on the same structure with the inhibitor deleted (Hornak et (11.,
2006).

2 METHODS
2.1 Structure of HIV-1 protease

Wild-type HIV-l protease is a symmetrical h0m0dimer comprising
polypeptide chains each containing 99 amino acid residues. We refer to the
two monomers as chain A and chain B. with residues numbered from 1 to
99 in chain A and from 101 to 199 in chain B.

Figure 1 shows the structure of HIV-1 protease. We show the structure
3LZU because its inhibitor darunavir is one which we study in detail later
in this article. The secondary structure motifs are clearly shown as arrows
(jg-sheet) and helices (oz-helix). The terminal region is situated at the base
of the enzyme and consists of the N- and C-termini of both monomers.

C-terminal of the monomers. The core region is composed primarily of
ﬁ-strands. The active site is situated within the core and consists of three
residues from each of the monomers. This pair of AstFThr7Gly triads is
a form of active site common to aspartic proteases (Toh at (11.. 1985). The
catalytic triads are located at residues 25727 and. due to symmetry. residues
1257127. The active site lies beneath the ﬂaps. the tips of which are indicated
in Figure 1. The ﬂap region extends out to the ﬂap ‘elbows” which. it has
been suggested. act as a cantilever for ﬂap motion (Harte at (11.. 1992;
Swaminathan at (11.. 1991). These are located at the widest section of the
protein. The ﬂap tips are a glycine-rich area of the protein and thus have
enhanced conformational ﬂexibility (Hong et (11.. 1997).

2.2 Selection of structures and inhibitors

A large number of structures of HIV-1 protease. with various mutations in
the sequence and with various inhibitors bound. are available in the PDB. We
have selected a set of 206 structures (Supplementary Fig. S4 and Table S2)
with a resolution of 2 A or better so as to ensure that the hydrogen bond
geometry assigned and used by FIRST is accurate.

In order to prepare the crystal structures for rigidity analysis. all the crystal
water molecules are removed. leaving the dimer unit of HIV-1 protease along
with the inhibitor with which it was crystallized. It has previously been
suggested that the presence of buried water is important as it coordinates
the protease ﬂap residues (W lodawer and Vondrasek. 1998). However. we
note that this should not affect the rigidity analysis presented by FIRST.
as molecular dynamics simulations (Mamonova at (11.. 2005) have shown
that the hydrogen bonds formed between the protein and the solvent have
a short duty cycle of typically <1 ps. comparable to those in liquid water
(Matsumoto at (11.. 2002). and should be neglected when considering rigidity.
The REDUCE software (Word at (11.. 1999) is then used to add the hydrogen
atoms that are not present in the X-ray crystal structure and to ﬂip side chains
of residues such as asparagine. glutamine and histidine to avoid clashes and
improve the hydrogen-bonding network. For a set of eight test cases. we
have examined the effect of running REDUCE before deletion of the crystal
waters. and no signiﬁcant difference in our results was observed. The 206
structures have arange of crystallization conditions. inhibitors and mutations.
For each structure that was crystallized with a ligand. a copy is made with its
inhibitor manually deleted. as in the molecular dynamics study by Hornak
et a1. (2006). We take it that this inhibitor-free structure is part of the ensemble
of conformations explored by the inhibitor-free protein during its natural
ﬂexible motion (Hornak at (11.. 2006).

Within the full set of 206 structures. we select a subset of ‘main inhibitors”
based on some of the commercially available protease inhibitors approved
for use in antiretroviral therapies. In accordance with Pokorna et a1. (2009).

we refer to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved inhibitors
by their three-letter abbreviations: APV (amprenavir. available as the pro-
drug fosampranavir). ATZ (atazanavir). DRV (darunavir). IDV (indinavir).
NFV (nelﬁnavir). SQV (saquinavir) and TPV (tipranavir). We also include
DMP-323 and the polypeptidic inhibitor (ACE)TI(NLE)(NLE)QR due to the
relatively large number of high-resolution structures crystallized with these
inhibitors. We label DMP-323 as DMP and (ACE)TI(NLE)(NLE)QR as PEP.
There are a different number of structures for each of the main inhibitors.
which are as follows: APV 7 8. ATZ 7 4. DRV 7 16. IDV 7 5. NFV 7 4. SQV
7 6. TPV 7 4. DMP 7 5 and PEP 7 5. making a total of 57 structures.

2.3 Rigidity analysis

A protein can be considered as a ‘molecular framework” consisting of atoms
and bonding constraints. The software FIRST carries out rigidity analysis on
such a framework using the ‘pebble game” algorithm (Jacobs and Thorpe.
1995; Jacobs 21111.. 2001). which matches degrees of freedom to constraints.
dividing the structure into overconstrained. isostatic or underconstrained
regions. An underconstrained region is ﬂexible. in the sense that dihedral
angles can vary and so atoms can move without violating distance constraints
(Thorpe at (11.. 2001). An isostatic region has an exact balance of constraints
and degrees of freedom; the removal of any constraint would make the region
ﬂexible. In overconstrained regions. it is possible to remove a constraint
without altering the rigidity of the region7there are constraints to spare.
A division such as this is called a rigid cluster decomposition (RCD).

The results of an RCD obviously depend on the set of bonds that
are included to rigidify the structure. In FIRST. the strong bonding forces
such as covalent bonds and hydrophobic interactions are always included.
Long-range electrostatic forces and van der Waals forces do not contribute
to the distance constraints between atoms because they are generally weak
at this level and not highly directional (Jacobs and Thorpe. 1995). Hydrogen
bonds and salt bridges are included in the constraint network on a selective
basis. In FIRST. the energy of each potential hydrogen bond in the structure
is calculated using the Mayo potential (Dahiyat at (11.. 1997) as a function of
the geometry of the donor. hydrogen and acceptor atoms. Bonds are included
as constraints if their energy lies below an energy cutoff Em. which is
usually given in kcal/mol. Thus. ECU, determines the bond network. which
in turn determines the RCD. This dependence on hydrogen bond geometry
means that the atomic coordinates need to be precise. hence our selection
of high-resolution structures. An RCD can be Visualized by appropriate
labelling of the 3D structure of a protein. For easier comparison between
different structures. it is also useful to consider the mainchain rigidity of
the protein. On a 1D representation of the protein sequence. residues are
labelled according to the rigid cluster membership of the Ca atom. Large
rigid clusters are represented by coloured blocks. while ﬂexible regions are
represented by a thin black line.

Supplementary Figure Sl gives examples of the rigidity of the structure
3LZU. in both 3D and 1D representations. Some key features of the RCD
are clearly Visible; a single rigid cluster can include residues from several
non-contiguous sections of the primary sequence. and indeed in this dimeric
protein a single large rigid cluster can include residues from both chains A
and B. The 1D representation shows clearly the change from a largely rigid
structure to a largely ﬂexible structure with a small shift in Em. A series of
1D representations makes up a ‘rigidity dilution plot”. examples of which
are shown in Figure 2.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Rigidity dilution

In a ‘rigidity dilution” (Wells et (11., 2009), hydrogen bonds are
removed in order from weakest to strongest by a gradual lowering
of Ecut, as discussed in the previous section. The resulting loss in

rigidity is visualized by plotting a new 1D representation of the
RCD whenever main chain rigidity changes. This highlights where

in the structure most of the rigidity resides, and where rigidity is
most readily lost. We note that the manner in which these plots
are constructed means that the vertical axis is non-linear with Ecut
(Wells et (11., 2009).

Figure 2 consists of four dilution plots describing the rigidity
of two crystal structures, 3LZU and 2HS1, before and after the
deletion of an inhibitor. The structures 2HS1 and 3LZU were both
selected because they were crystallized with the inhibitor darunavir,
an antiviral drug that was approved by the FDAin June 2006 and was
designed to form strong interactions with many different mutated
structures of the protease (Ghosh et (11., 2007). The dilution plots
of the structures as they were crystallized are given in Figure 2a
and c. In both cases, the protein loses the majority of its rigidity
abruptly, as the 1D proﬁles change from being mostly rigid to being
mostly ﬂexible with a single step in Ecm. This is ﬁrst-order rigidity
loss, as expected for a protein with a largely ﬂ-sheet secondary
structure (Wells et (11., 2009). The ﬂap regions around residues
50 and 150 are visible in the rigidity dilution as they become
ﬂexible at higher Ecut than the main body of the protein. The
helical regions near the terminal residues 86—94 are also visible
as their rigidity persists after the main body of the protein has
become ﬂexible. Previous studies (Tan and Rader, 2009; Wells
et (11., 2009) have included structures with resolution worse than
2 A, and so we also examined a small selection of such structures
and veriﬁed that rigidity analysis was qualitatively consistent: each
showed ﬁrst-order rigidity loss with the ﬂaps becoming ﬂexible
before the main body of the protein. (Supplementary Table S1 and
Fig. S2).

Plots for the same structures with the inhibitors deleted are given
in Figure 2b and d. Deletion of the inhibitor does not appear to alter
the basic pattern of rigidity loss during the dilution. However, the
ﬂap regions become ﬂexible at even higher Ecut. The active site of
the enzyme is not distinctive in the rigidity analysis of either the
inhibited or uninhibited structures, forming part of the largest rigid
cluster until the protein becomes mostly ﬂexible. The principal effect
of the inhibitor upon the rigidity proﬁle of the protein is to rigidify
the ﬂap tip region rather than the active site.

For quantitative analysis, it is typical to extract signiﬁcant energy
cutoff values from the RCD plots. Previous studies such as those on
rigidity in the context of thermostability (Rader, 2010; Radestocke
and Gohlke, 2008, 2011) have considered measures such as the
folding core energy. This is deﬁned to be the lowest line in the
dilution plot where at least three consecutive residues are mutually
rigid with at least three other consecutive residues of another
secondary structural element (Hespenheide et (11., 2002; Tastan et (11.,
2007). In this instance we are interested in the function rather than
the folding or melting point of the protein and so, in order to quantify
the inﬂuence of inhibitor binding on the overall rigidity of the protein
and on the ﬂexibility of the ﬂap regions, we deﬁne two signiﬁcant
values of Ecut for our analysis. We deﬁne Ebody to be the highest
Ecut at which at least 70% of the protein is ﬂexible. Due to the ﬁrst-
order nature of the rigidity loss in HIV-1 protease, this value would
not change much if we made our deﬁnition of Ebody based on any
ﬂexibility in the 50—90% range (data not shown). We also note that
for HIV-1 protease the folding core energy and Ebody are similar,
typically separated in the dilution plots by just one line.

Fig. 3. Distributions of Ebody and Eﬂap values for 206 structures. Structures complexed with TPV are coloured grey. the other ‘main inhibitors” are shown in
black. and the rest of the population is shown in white. Population distributions of Ebody and Eﬂap are given for structures with inhibitors present (a) and (c).
and after the inhibitors have been removed (b) and (d). The distributions of differences Ebody(I)—Ebody(U) in (e) and Eﬂap(I)—Eﬂap(U) in (f) give a clearer

idea of what changes occur within individual structures.

Residues Ile50 and Ile150 are residues at the tip of the ﬂaps
and have been tracked previously in molecular dynamics so as to
assess the motion of the ﬂaps as the protein samples an ensemble
of conformations in its native state (Zhu et (11., 2003). Due to
the symmetry of the crystal structures used here, these residues
become ﬂexible at the same Ecut in almost all the structures.
We select Eﬂap as our second important value of Ecut to be the
Ecut at which Ile50 ﬁrst becomes ﬂexible in the rigidity dilution
process. For numerical reasons, we sometimes observe that Eﬂap
has a small positive value, as observed in Figure 2b, in such a
case, we take Eﬂap to be the highest negative value of Ecut. This
means that in Figure 2a for example, Ebody = — 1.539 kcal/mol and
Eﬂap = 70.216 kcal/mol.

3.2 Inhibition and overall rigidity

The loss of rigidity occurs at different values of Ebody for different
crystal structures—for example, 71539 kcal/mol in Figure 2a and
71.985 kcal/mol in Figure 2c. Deletion of the inhibitor can shift
Ebody to slightly higher values: 71.355 kcal/mol in Figure 2b
and 71.857 kcal/mol in Figure 2d. We now consider whether the
presence of the inhibitor signiﬁcantly affects the overall rigidity of
the protease.

In Figure 3a, we show the distribution of Ebod values for
structures with the inhibitor present, which we call Ebody(I).

The distribution is approximately normal with a peak around
—1.5kcal/mol; almost all values lie between —0.5 kcal/mol and
—2.5 kcal/mol (Wells et (11., 2009). Figure 3b shows the distribution
of Ebody values for ‘uninhibited’ structures, that is, with the inhibitor
deleted. This distribution of Ebody(U) is very similar to that of
Ebody (I); deletion of the inhibitor does not appear to have a strong
effect on overall rigidity. Figure 3c and d show the corresponding
plots for the distribution of Eﬂap values. In contrast to the situation
with Ebody, there is a shift in the population when the inhibitors
are removed, with the Eﬂap values in general shifting towards zero
after the removal. We note that these distributions do not tell us
about the effect of inhibitor deletion on each structure individually.
The distribution of individual differences Ebody (I)—Eb0dy (U) and
Eﬂap(I)—Eﬂap(U) are shown in Figure 3e and f, respectively.
Figure 3e shows a distribution strongly peaked around a modal value
close to zero, with few structures having a difference of less than
—0.5 kcal/mol. This conﬁrms that deletion of the inhibitor does not
typically have a strong effect on overall rigidity. However, Figure 3f
shows a bimodal distribution, with many structures exhibiting
a large change in Eﬂap following the removal of an inhibitor.
Throughout Figure 3, we also show the distribution for our set of
‘main inhibitors”. The distributions for this set closely resemble the
distributions for all structures, illustrating that in terms of Ebody and
Eﬂap, the selection of ‘main inhibitors” is representative of the entire
population.

3.3 Flap rigidity and ﬂexibility

We have seen that the ﬂap region becomes ﬂexible at a higher Ecut
than the main body of the dimer. We can quantify this by comparing
the Ecut value at which the ﬂap tips become ﬂexible, Eﬂap, to the

value at which the main body becomes ﬂexible, Ebody. We deﬁne

the ﬂexibility fraction <I> = Em" .
body

the ﬂaps are ﬂexible from the beginning of the dilution (in which
case Eﬂa = 0), to 1, if the ﬂaps become ﬂexible only when the main
body becomes ﬂexible (i.e. Eﬂap =Eb0dy); this normalization aids
comparison between structures with different values of Ebody.

In general, we denote the ﬂexibility fraction of an inhibited
structure as <I>(I) and the ﬂexibility fraction of a structure with
the inhibitor deleted as <I>(U). The inﬂuence of the inhibitor on
the ﬂap rigidity is measured as the difference between them and is
denoted ACD, so that A<I>= <I>(I)—<I>(U). Since <I>(I),<I>(U)e[0,1],
we have that A<I>e[—1, 1] but note that A<I> <0 corresponds to
the physically improbable situation where the ﬂaps show enhanced
rigidity after the deletion of the inhibitor. In the majority of cases,
we observe that A<I> e[0,1]. Low positive values of A<I> indicate
that the presence of the inhibitor makes little difference to the ﬂap
rigidity, and high positive values indicate that the ﬂaps are rigidiﬁed
by the presence of the inhibitor. It has been previously noted that
stabilizing mutations can affect the rigidity analysis computed using
FIRST (Tan and Rader, 2009). The value of CD is therefore inﬂuenced
not only by the presence and identity of the inhibitor but also by
the presence of any stabilizing mutations in the enzyme. However
<I>(I) and <I>(U) are calculated each time from the same structure
and so the effects of mutations are accounted for by considering
the difference ACD. We also note that our choice of Ebody over the
similar folding core energy does not substantially change the value
of A<I> or the conclusions drawn from these values (Supplementary
Fig. S2).

Initially, we examine structures crystallized with the inhibitor
darunavir, as in Figure 2. Darunavir is chosen as it is a recently
FDA-approved protease inhibitor (Ghosh et (11., 2007), and there
are a relatively large number (16) of high-resolution structures of
HIV-1 protease crystallized with darunavir in the PDB. The CD values
for all 16 of these structures are presented in Table 1.

We ﬁnd that the <I>(I) values range from 0.031 to 0.468. Two
of the values, for 3D1Z and 3LZU, are noticeably higher than the
others. Discounting these, there is little variation and the remaining
values have a mean of 0.074. There is similar variation in the <I>(U)
values, although as they are smaller than the <I>(I), the variation
itself is of a smaller magnitude. In almost every case, we have
that 0 f A<I> f 0.075, suggesting that darunavir has in general only
a small rigidifying effect on the ﬂap tips. 2HS2 is different in that
A<I> <0, but the magnitude of the negative value is so small that
the effect of the inhibitor on this structure is minimal, similar to
the structure 3JW2. Contrastingly in 3LZU, ACI>=0.455 and the
inhibitor appears to have a sizeable rigidifying effect, as can be seen
by comparing Figure 2c and 2d. The differences in values of A<I>
underline the fact that different crystallization conditions can affect
the rigidity of the enzyme—inhibitor complex.

Figure 4a, 0 and e show the distributions of <I>(I), <I>(U) and ACD,
respectively. Again, we ﬁnd that the distributions for the set of ‘main
inhibitors” are similar to the distributions for all structures. Figure 4a
shows that, unlike the distribution of Ebody values, the distribution of
<I>(I) values is bimodal; there are peaks near values of zero, indicating
that the ﬂaps are ﬂexible from near the beginning of the rigidity
dilution, and also near 1, indicating that the ﬂaps form an integral
part of the main rigid body of the dimer. In contrast, the distribution
of <I>(U) has a single peak at near-zero values, seen in Figure 40.
After deletion of the inhibitor from the structure, it is much more
common for the ﬂaps to be ﬂexible relative to the rest of the protein
at high Ecut values. The distribution of A CD values in 4e conﬁrms this
impression. We see a broad and bimodal distribution of values with
peaks around zero (minimal effect on ﬂap rigidity) and around values
near 1, indicating a strong effect on ﬂap rigidity. The bimodality
of the distribution suggests that inhibitors might fall into different
classes—those which typically affect ﬂap rigidity and those which
do not.

We now consider our set of ‘main inhibitors” more carefully.
The distributions of <I>(I), <I>(U) and A<I> for these inhibitors are
shown using box plots in Figure 4b, d and f, respectively. The box
plots demonstrate the range of values observed for each inhibitor by
indicating the total range of the distribution as well as the median
and the inter-quartile range. In Figure 4b, we see that the inhibitors
can be divided into three groups based upon the spread of the <I>(I)
values. APV, DRV, IDV and NFV all have consistently low <I>(I)
values, indicating that the ﬂaps are typically ﬂexible in structures
crystallized with these inhibitors. ATZ, DMP, PEP and SQV have
a wide spread of values, with some of the individual structures
crystallised with these inhibitors having much more rigid ﬂaps.
Tipranavir (TPV) is distinctive in that the ﬂaps are consistently
highly rigid in structures crystallized with this inhibitor. The groups
have been colour coded in Figure 4b according to their different

rigidifying effects. The colour coding is maintained in Figure 4d
and f. Figure 4d shows that <I>(U) values are low across all of the
‘main inhibitors” including tipranavir. That is, with the inhibitors
deleted, all the structures now have ﬂexible ﬂaps. This is evidence
that the variations in ﬂap rigidity observed in the <I>(I) values are
attributable to the inhibitors, rather than being coincidental effects
of the conditions of crystallization. The distribution of A<I> values,
shown in Figure 4f, conﬁrms this impression.

3.5 Inhibitor binding and inhibition mechanisms

Tipranavir is distinctive in that A<I> is consistently high for
structures inhibited by tipranavir. Reviewing the distributions of
Ebody values in Figure 3, where the tipranavir structures are
highlighted, demonstrates that tipranavir is not distinctive in its
effect on the overall rigidity of the protease. Thus, tipranavir appears
to act speciﬁcally by rigidifying the ﬂaps above the active site.
This effect is not due to tipranavir forming an unusually large
number of hydrogen bonds, or indeed hydrophobic interactions,
with the protease. In Figure 5, we show distributions of the
number of bonds formed by inhibitors. Inhibitors with a large
effect on ﬂap rigidity have a slight tendency to form more
hydrogen bonds than inhibitors with a small effect; the number of
hydrophobic interactions shows little difference between the two
classes. Tipranavir is not distinctive in either case, suggesting that the

number of interactions is not the driving force for its large effect upon
rigidifying the ﬂaps. The value of rigidity analysis is demonstrated
by its sensitivity not only to the number but also to the location of
constraint formation.

Tipranavir has a unique structure among the nine main inhibitors.
It is the ﬁrst true non-peptidic HIV-1 protease inhibitor and has
shown considerable activity against many drug-resistant strains of
HIV (Pokoma et a1., 2009). Its ﬂexibility is not hampered by the
presence of a rigid peptide bond. Flexibility is a property which
increases the chance of a drug being able to resist some mutations
in the protease (Velazquez-Campoy et a1., 2001). Darunavir was
also designed to be adaptable to drug-resistant strains (Ghosh et a1.,
2007), but rigidity analysis indicates that tipranavir and darunavir
have quite different modes of action.

Examining the interactions identiﬁed by FIRST between tipranavir
and the protease using PYMOL shows that tipranavir forms hydrogen
bonds with the isoleucine residues 50 and 150, and not the residues
of the active site. In contrast, other inhibitors such as darunavir
typically bond with the active site and not with the ﬂap tip residues.
The difference between these two types of interaction can be seen
in Figure 6.

Rigidity analysis indicates two different modes of action for
HIV-1 protease inhibitors: direct interaction with the active site or
interaction with the ﬂaps to rigidify them in a closed conformation
and thus indirectly prevent access to the active site. The HIV-1

protease inhibitor ritonavir became FDA-approved in 1996 and is
often administered in combination with other protease inhibitors
during antiretroviral therapy. There is a small selection of HIV-
1 protease structures in the PDB which have been crystallized in
complex with ritonavir. Although some of these structures have a
worse resolution than 2 A, we have performed a rigidity analysis
and determined that they have consistently low A<I> values, that
is, ritonavir does not rigidify the ﬂaps (Supplementary Fig. S3
and Table S1). Hence, the complementary approach of using one
inhibitor that targets the ﬂaps of the protease and one which does not
may account for the efﬁcacy of tipranavir—ritonavir in combination
reported by Hicks et al. (2005).

4 CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

Our principal ﬁnding is that inhibitors of HIV-1 protease fall into
two classes which differ in their effects on the rigidity of the
ﬂ-hairpin ‘ﬂaps’: those which restrict the ﬂexibility and those which
do not. Nine inhibitors, including seven FDA-approved retroviral
drugs were studied in detail and of those which do restrict the
ﬂaps, tipranavir stands out as being consistently effective for this
purpose. Rigidity analysis presents a way of studying the interactions
an inhibitor creates with the enzyme, and hence can offer a new
perspective during the process of drug design.

In summary, we have carried out an extensive comparative rigidity
analysis on a set of 206 high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of

HIV-1 protease in complex with a variety of inhibitors. We have
performed rigidity dilution using FIRST on each structure with the
inhibitor present and again with the inhibitor deleted. We describe
the effect of inhibitor binding on the rigidity of the protein, using
measures of overall protein rigidity and of the rigidity of the
ﬂ-hairpin ‘ﬂaps’ above the active site. HIV-1 protease in solution
can have the ﬂaps either open or closed. We predict that inhibitors
that rigidify the ﬂaps will bias the structure towards having the
ﬂaps closed, and that this bias will be weaker for inhibitors that do
not rigidify the ﬂaps. The prevalence of open-ﬂap and closed-ﬂap
conformations could be probed using spectroscopic methods. We
conﬁrm the ﬁnding (Wells et al., 2009) that HIV-1 protease shows
an abrupt or ﬁrst-order loss of rigidity. The presence or absence of
an inhibitor does not typically have a signiﬁcant effect on the energy
cutoff at which rigidity is lost during the dilution. The active site
of the protease is not distinctive in the rigidity analysis, typically
forming part of the main rigid cluster until overall rigidity is lost. In
contrast, the ﬂ-hairpin ﬂaps are observable in the rigidity analysis
as they typically become ﬂexible at higher Ecut than the main
body of the protein. This effect is observed across the population
of X-ray crystal structures. The ﬂexible nature of the ﬂaps is in
qualitative agreement with molecular dynamics simulations as well
as experimental work using NMR (Hornak et al., 2006; Nicholson
et al., 1995; Zhu et al., 2003).

The ﬂaps are usually considered to have high conformational
ﬂexibility—due in part to their high glycine content (Freedberg et al.,
2001). In molecular dynamics simulations, the presence of glycine is
conducive to ﬂexibility as its minimal R group allows wider variation
in backbone dihedral angles than for other amino acids. Here we
ﬁnd that glycine is also conducive to ﬂexibility in rigidity analysis,
but for a different reason: it is not capable of forming side chain
interactions, either hydrogen bonds or hydrophobic tethers, and so
tends to introduce fewer constraints into the system.

We construct the ‘ﬂexibility fraction” as a normalized measure
of the rigidity of the ﬂaps compared to the main body of the
protein. We ﬁnd that the effect of inhibitor binding on ﬂap
ﬂexibility varies greatly, from zero/minimal to large rigidifying
effect. Detailed examination of a set of inhibitors including
FDA-approved antiretroviral medications shows that inhibitors can
be divided into two classes: those that typically do not rigidify the
ﬂaps, and those which do. The rigidifying effect of the inhibitors
is not a direct consequence of the number of hydrogen bonds or
hydrophobic interactions that are formed with the protease, but
rather the location of the interactions. Tipranavir, a non-peptidic
inhibitor, is distinctive for the strength and consistency of its effect
in rigidifying the ﬂaps. The ﬂexibility of the ﬂaps could serve to
permit the ‘ﬂexibility-assisted catalysis” mechanism introduced by
Piana et al. (2002) and thus tipranavir may be acting to combat this
mechanism. We observe that it eschews interaction with the active
site while forming hydrogen bond interactions with the isoleucine
residues at the tips of the ﬂaps. This suggests that its mode of action
is quite distinct from that of inhibitors such as darunavir, which
interact with the active site rather than the ﬂaps. An inhibitor capable
of interacting with the active site and the ﬂaps simultaneously may
be particularly effective and/or particularly difﬁcult for the virus to
evade by mutation. The combination of one protease inhibitor from
each class appears to be effective in current multi-drug therapies
(Hicks et al., 2005) and should be borne in mind in the selection of
future multi-drug therapies.

Fig. 1. Secondary structure of the 23S rRNA (Escherichia coli) with 2904 bases. (A) Circle plot, (B) radial layout using the gradient descent approach

radial layout method for smaller structures. Second, the graph—
ical user interface allows one to stop a calculation, save the
coordinates and resume later.

The graphical user interface offers manual editing, which can
be useful even if there are no intersections to be repaired.
RNAde is ﬂexible here. Single bases or a set of selected bases
can be moved without restrictions. Like other tools, RNAde
allows bases to be colored; non—canonical base pairs can be
incorporated; and many drawing parameters ranging from line
width, the size of bases, to the interval of tick marks can be
adjusted.

The program can, of course, be invoked from the command
line, making it suitable for automation in pipelines or batch jobs.
One can also generate circle plots, linear plots and mountain
plots. The input follows the dot/bracket format used in the
ViennaRNA Package (Lorenz et al., 2011). Output can be
saved in several different formats defined by the underlying
graphics library. The choices include PDF, SVG and popular
bitmap formats such as PNG, so it is easy to incorporate dia—
grams in other files.

RNAde is a tool for people with patience, but there may be
no other program that gives similar approximations to radial
layouts for large structures. It is hoped that the program is
already useful for publications and presentations. The perform—
ance will be improved. Parts of the cost function are independent
and suitable for parallelizing. There is room for heuristics
for better starting configurations. There is also room for
more sophisticated treatment of pseudoknots and tertiary
interactions.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Next-generation sequencing has become a powerful tool in
personalized medicine. Exomes or even whole genomes of patients
suffering from rare diseases are screened for sequence variants. After
filtering out common polymorphisms, the assessment and interpret-
ation of detected personal variants in the clinical context is an often
time-consuming effort. We have developed GeneTalk, a web-based
platform that serves as an expert exchange network for the assess-
ment of personal and potentially disease-relevant sequence variants.
GeneTalk assists a clinical geneticist who is searching for information
about specific sequence variants and connects this user to other users
with expertise for the same sequence variant.

Availability: GeneTalk is available at www.gene-talk.de. Users can
login without registering in a demo account.

1 INTRODUCTION

Exome sequencing has become an invaluably powerful tool in
the identiﬁcation of disease causing variants (Bamshad et al.,
2011; Robinson et al., 2011) and the first patients are now al-
ready treated based on sequence variant information of their
exomes (W orthey et al., 2011). To date, the primary bottleneck
in such clinical personal genome cases is not anymore data gen-
eration but data analysis. Clinical geneticists therefore require
efﬁcient tools for ﬁltering and interpreting the clinically mean-
ingful sequence variants.

Currently, the most potent ﬁlters for reducing the set of novel
and potentially causal mutations in rare diseases are based on
variation data from population scale sequencing efforts such as
the 1000 genomes project (www.1000genomes.org). Only very
few variants will be medically relevant, perhapsiin case of a
monogenic disorderijust one. Bioinformatics tools such as
ANNOVAR (Wang et al., 2010) and MutationTaster (Schwarz
et al., 2010) may then be used for comprehensive annotations
and predictions about the expected pathogenicity of a variant.
However, such classiﬁers have high false-positive and -negative
error rates. They may therefore serve only for prioritization but
cannot replace the assessment of human experts.

APPROACH

In a genetic disease of unknown cause, the association with a new
disease gene may be shown either by a functional assessment of
the detected variants or by statistical evidence. For a functional
assessment, expert knowledge about a suitable test essay or gen-
etically modiﬁed model organisms is required. For statistical evi-
dence, a sufﬁcient number of patients of the same disease group
with mutations in the same gene are required. However, usually a
clinical geneticist analyzing a patient’s exome does not have
access to many similar cases because the disease is so rare.
Furthermore, she may not be skilled to do the functional assess-
ment immediately and happened to identify a new gene of inter-
est after ﬁltering the patient’s variants. Hence, such a geneticist is
interested in finding other individuals with mutations in the same
gene or scientists that are performing basic research on this gene.
Web-based expert networks proved to be efﬁcient tools for
knowledge management in various scientiﬁc ﬁelds. There are
knowledge bases for disease, gene and protein-centered informa-
tion (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim, www.geneontology.org,
www.wikiproteins.org). However, there is no platform that
allows the scientiﬁc exchange of experts about speciﬁc variants
detected in next-generation sequencing (NGS) experiments.
GeneTalk aims at providing such a web-based platform that
enables to improve expert annotations on human genetic vari-
ants in a community approach.

APPLICATION

GeneTalk is an exchange platform that allows users to look for
variant-speciﬁc information and makes human expertise search-
able (Fig. 1). Any sequence variant with respect to the human
reference genome, based on the GRCh37 assembly, is annotat-
able. The user decides to whom an annotation is Visible. One user
may link to scientiﬁc articles that are relevant in context with a
certain variant or that even provide evidence that a mutation is
disease causing. A second user might comment on this annota-
tion to express her concern because she Views the detected variant
as an technical artefact. A third user might state that she has seen
patients with this genotype and is not sure about the statistical
signiﬁcance of the association with the phenotype. All annota-
tions and comments of GeneTalk users about a certain genomic
position can be read like a locus-speciﬁc conversation thread.
The trustworthiness of annotations can be rated by users as
well as the likelihood of a mutation to be disease causing
(Fig. 1). If there is consensus in the GeneTalk community that

Fig. 1. GeneTalk, a communication platform for sequence variants. A user ﬁlters sequence variants down to a small set of potentially disease relevant
mutations. She then searches for detailed information annotated by the GeneTalk community for these variants. In GeneTalk, users may annotate and
comment genetic variants. Annotations and comments may link to the relevant literature or discuss experimental and clinical ﬁndings. Based on this
locus-speciﬁc information, GeneTalk users may rate the trustworthiness of an annotation and the potential of a mutation to be disease causing. This
screenshot is taken from fritz’ account who is looking at the annotation of a mutation in the gene PIGV. The GeneTalk community ﬁnds this annotation
trustworthy and rates the described mutation as highly likely to cause a syndrome called hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation. The user petkraw
left a comment for this variant. He seems to have some expertise in this disease and might be an interesting person to contact for fritz

a certain mutation is pathogenic and its annotation is trust-
worthy, this mutation is added to the annotation track ‘patho-
genic’. This annotation track is thus curated in a collaborative
effort of all GeneTalk users.

GeneTalk also assists users in ﬁltering genetic variants from
NGS projects. A user that has a patient’s informed consent to
analyze the clinical data may upload sequence variants to
GeneTalk in variant call format (VCF) (Danecek et al., 2011),
version 4.0 and above. In order to reduce the initial VCF to a set
of potentially disease relevant mutations, the user can apply cer-
tain ﬁlter settings ﬁrst: the list of variants could be restricted to,
e.g. only nonsynonymous, homozygous variants with the func-
tional and inheritance ﬁlter. Common variants can be ﬁltered out
by a genotype frequency ﬁlter that is based on high-quality NGS
data sets from HapMap, the 1000 genomes project and the 5000
exomes project. If a linkage analysis has been performed, a gen-
omic interval may be set to limit the search space or gene panels
may be applied as in silico ﬁlters to restrict the analysis to certain
molecular pathways. In a rare recessive monogenic disease, the
mode of inheritance and the genotype frequency ﬁlter that is set
to 1/1000 usually reduce the number of candidate mutations
down to a few hundreds in a patient’s exome. These variants
may then be further analyzed for ‘disease-causing’ annotations.
If the pathogenic mutation of this case has not yet been described
in the literature and no ‘pathogenic’ annotation exists, the user
can look for annotations that discuss patients with similar
phenotypes or basic research scientists that talk about unpub-
lished experimental data for this gene. Such an annotation can
serve as a conversation starter and the users can simply contact
the author by clicking on the envelope symbol (Fig. 1).
Currently, the annotation database contains over 32 000 clinic-
ally relevant entries from dBSNP. A Video tutorial on www. gene-
talk.de illustrates how an exome dataset may be analyzed in
GeneTalk: In a few easy steps, the variant data of a simulated

patient with hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation syn-
drome are ﬁltered down to the disease-causing mutation.

CONCLUSIONS

GeneTalk provides an intuitive web-based interface for geneti-
cists that analyze human sequence variants. GeneTalk is a plat-
form for efﬁcient knowledge management of genetic variants and
simpliﬁes the scientiﬁc discussion and interpretation especially of
rare mutations.

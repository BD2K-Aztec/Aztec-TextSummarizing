ABSTRACT

Motivation: The growing field of systems biology has driven demand
for flexible tools to model and simulate biological systems. Two
established problems in the modeling of biological processes are
model selection and the estimation of associated parameters. A
number of statistical approaches, both frequentist and Bayesian,
have been proposed to answer these questions.

Results: Here we present a Python package, ABC-SysBio, that
implements parameter inference and model selection for dynamical
systems in an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) framework.
ABC-SysBio combines three algorithms: ABC rejection sampler, ABC
SMC for parameter inference and ABC SMC for model selection.
It is designed to work with models written in Systems Biology
Markup Language (SBML). Deterministic and stochastic models can
be analyzed in ABC-SysBio.

1 INTRODUCTION

In the last decade, modeling of biochemical systems using ordinary
and stochastic differential equations (ODE and SDE) has become
increasingly popular as quantitative ideas have begun to pervade
the biomolecular sciences. Inferring model parameters and ranking
alternative models is necessary in order to gather reliable future
predictions about the dynamical behavior of such systems. The
problem of parameter estimation in deterministic systems has been
addressed by using local and global non-linear optimization methods
(Mendes and Kell, 1998; Moles et (11., 2003) as well as maximum-
likelihood estimation (Baker et (11., 2005; Bortz and Nelson, 2006;
Muller et (11., 2004; Timmer and Muller, 2004) and within a
Bayesian framework (Banks et (11., 2005, Huang et (11., 2006, Putter
et (11., 2002). An approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) scheme
based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) has been developed for
likelihood-free parameter inference in deterministic and stochastic
systems (Toni et (11., 2009). Furthermore, this approach also allows

for model selection, i.e. evidence-based ranking of alternative
models.

Because in ABC methods the evaluation of the likelihood is
replaced by simulations, the implementation of these methods hides
some numerical and technical problems. This includes ﬁnding
numerically the solution of stiff ODE systems or stochastic systems
described by SDEs or a master equation. This requires a ﬂexible and
adaptive implementation of ABC methods to address each speciﬁc
model with its biochemical as well as dynamical problems.

Here we present an extensible Python package, ABC-SysBio,
which implements approximate Bayesian computation for parameter
inference and model selection in deterministic and stochastic
models. The package supports the stande models exchange format,
SBML, as well as user-deﬁned models written in Python. In addition,
graphical processing unit support is provided via pycuda (Klockner
et (11., 2009). User-deﬁned algorithmic parameters allow for the
adaptation and tuning of the inference procedures included in the
package to suit each speciﬁc dynamical model.

Note that in contrast to other packages for parameter inference
in a Bayesian framework, e.g. DIYABC (Comuet et (11., 2008) and
BioBayes (Vyshemirsky and Girolami, 2008), ABC-SysBio allows
for parameter inference and model selection of both deterministic
and stochastic models. Its implementation is ﬂexible and user
friendly: it supports important model exchange standards and is
easily integrated into existing computational pipelines and systems
biology frameworks through the ﬂexibility of Python.

2 METHODS

The package ABC-SysBio is implemented as a Python module.
abcsysbio. Together with the two Python scripts abc-sysbio-sbml-sum and
run-abc-sysbio. it creates a user friendly tool that can be applied to models
in SBML format without any further software development. It is advisable
to use the package together with the Python Enthought Distribution.
though this is not essential. It works on both MacOS and Linux operating
systems.

The module. abcsysbio. can be imported into an interactive Python
session. and by deﬁning the arguments to the functions in the interactive
namespace. they can be used through the Python shell.

When run-abc-sysbio is called. model(s) written in SBML format are
parsed to generate a corresponding Python module representing the model.
The format of the Python module written depends on the integration type.
which also informs the program which solver to use to simulate the model.

We provide algorithms to simulate ODE. SDE and Gillespie models (Press
at (11.. 1992). All algorithms are adapted to the speciﬁc requirements of

models in the Biomodels database. Beside the possibility of only numerically
solving the provided model. one of the three following algorithms can be
called.

2.1 ABC rejection sampler for parameter inference

Given a parameter 9. its prior distribution 71(9) and a dataset x. we want to
approximate the posterior distribution 71(9lx). The ABC rejection sampler
proceeds as follows:

(1) Sample 9* from TI.
(2) Simulate a dataset Jr" from the model with parameter 6*.
(3) If d(x0,x*) 5 e. accept 9. otherwise reject.

(4) Return to l.

where d(x0,x*) is a distance function and e is a tolerance. The implemented
distance function is the Euclidian distance; however the user can easily
deﬁne custom distance metrics. To obtain reliable parameter estimates. 6
should be very small. The ABC rejection sampler should be used only for
simple systems that allow a fast simulation. because the rejection rate of this
algorithm is usually very high.

The ABC rejection sampler describes the ﬁrst sampled population of the
ABC SMC algorithm and is therefore implemented as part of the ABC SMC
algorithms described below.

2.2 ABC SMC for parameter inference

Using ABC in a SMC framework leads to the ABC SMC algorithm (Toni
et (11.. 2009). A number of particles are sampled from the prior distribution
71(9) and propagated through a sequence of intermediate distributions
until the population represents an approximated posterior distribution. The
intermediate distributions are deﬁned by a sequence of tolerances e, in
decreasing order. 61 > 62 >  > 6]" Z 0. Therefore ABC SMC for parameter
inference is automatically invoked when only one model. but more than one
6 are provided. Additionally. the user needs to provide perturbation kernels.
which deﬁne how a particle is perturbed after resarnpling from the previous
intermediate distribution.

This algorithm can be considered a special case of the model selection
algorithm implemented in ABC-SysBio. The ABC SMC for parameter
inference algorithm is nested within ABC SMC for model selection.
Therefore. the same ABC-SysBio functions. with the same computational
features. are called whichever of the algorithms are run.

2.3 ABC SMC for model selection

An algorithm to select between several deterministic or stochastic dynamical
models for a given dataset has been implemented; here the model
identiﬁers/labels are treated as an additional parameter. as described in Toni
and Stumpf. 2010. Therefore. a prior distribution over models as well as
perturbation kernels for model transitions need to be deﬁned by the user. The
implementation of the model selection algorithm using ABC SMC provides
the framework for the above mentioned nested algorithms.

2.4 Options

Users can deﬁne several algorithmic parameters. for example. prior
distributions or perturbation kernels. Several distributions are already
implemented. e.g. uniform distribution. Gaussian distribution and log-
normal distribution. but further distributions can be added easily. The user
should deﬁne the 6 schedule. because it is strongly dependent on the
biochemical/dynamical system under investigation. as well as on the noise in
the provided data. Note that the dataset does not necessarily need to include
data for all species deﬁned in the model. but can be a subset or even a
combination of several species.

After each sampled population. ABC-SysBio provides the user with
information about the algorithm’s progress. The rejection rate per population.

3 SUMMARY

ABC-SysBio is a ﬂexible, extendable and user-friendly Python
package that can import models described in the SBML standard
combined with experimental data. Our package approximates the
posterior parameter distribution and compares different model
structures to select the model that represents the data best.

Quantifying the complexity of medical research

 

however, a disease such as diabetes involves multiple organs and
tissues. Yet another reason could come from the multiplicity of
signaling pathways involved in a disease. Thus, a greater multi—
plicity of elements in a disease could mean a greater search space
to investigate.

A theoretical disease model can further illustrate this latter
point. This theoretical model involves a non—existent animal spe—
cies called bigenes, which has two genes in its genome: A and B.
Bigenes suffers a species—speciﬁc disease called X, which is known
to be driven by a mutation in A. Up to the year t, the literature
on X comprised ﬁve articles focused on gene A. The publication
record about X at time I could be represented as X, = {AAAAA}.
Thus, X, is a simpliﬁed representation of what was known about
X up to time t. The genes belonging to X, may not be disease
genes in a traditional sense, but they represent the scientiﬁc con—
versation taking place about X, even in cases when negative re—
sults are reported, which may be contradicted later on. Deﬁning
‘disease genes’ is in itself a complicated task as the relationship
between a gene and a disease can range from strong and ﬁrmly
established to tenuous, depending on the weight of the existing
evidence.

A breakthrough in the research of X occurred in the year t+ I,
when a mutation in B was newly associated with X. New articles
appeared investigating this association; however, other articles
still focused on A, leading to X,+1={AAAAABABBA}, where
the subsequence {BABBA} corresponds to publications for the
year t+1. Thus, the discovery of a mutation in B made the
scientiﬁc model of the disease X more complex, and this is
reﬂected in the publication record. This change in complexity
can be quantified using the entropy measure from information
theory, which is a common measure of statistical complexity
(Feldman and Crutchfield, 1998) used in biomedical applications
such as monitoring heart rates (Perkiomaki et al., 2005) and
brain electrical activity (Stam, 2005) or in evolutionary biology
(Adami, 2002). The entropy for X, is H ( X, ) :0, but the intro—
duction ofB in year t+ 1 leads to H(X,+1) = 0.88 (see Section 2).
H ( X ,+ 1 ) >H ( X , ) reﬂects the increase in complexity over time.

A number of works have been devoted to analyzing the
growth and evolution of publications on gene and protein inter—
actions outside the context of disease by analyzing the accumu—
lated published record (Arbesman and Christakis, 2011; Cokol
et al., 2005; Cokol and Rodriguez—Esteban, 2006; He and Zhang,
2009; Hoffmann and Valencia, 2003; Pfeiffer and Hoffmann,
2007). However, there is a divergence between the published
record and the focus of active research, as older works fade in
inﬂuence (on average). We believe that practical disease models
do not involve every piece of knowledge published about a dis—
ease. Defining boundaries, nonetheless, is not straightforward. In
the case of the disease X, publications were initially only about
gene A, but that changed after an important discovery. Realizing
this requires speciﬁc knowledge of the disease and a scientiﬁc
consensus that may not be found. To generalize, we have used
a time window. A model containing the state of the art in year
t+ I for a 1—year time window would be X’,+1 = {BABBA}. We
call this a fading memory model, and it reﬂects that the older a
ﬁnding is, the less relevant it becomesijust like a fading
memory. This decay can be observed in the evolution of citation
counts of published literature over time.

One shortcoming of the fading memory approach is that some
diseases have much higher publication rate than others.
However, memories may fade faster for diseases with higher
publication rate owing to the ﬁnite memory of the scientists
that study them. A ﬁnite memory approach would consider the
latest 11 publications rather than a time window. In the case of X,
this would mean a disease model X ’,+ 1 2 {BA} for a memory size
of 1122. We have centered our analysis on the ﬁnite memory
approach because publication rates change widely over timei
and between diseasesiand thus comparing ﬁxed time windows
would require some type of normalization, which could intro—
duce distortions. Nonetheless, the fading memory approach is
also discussed, as will be shown later in the text.

Another important aspect of disease models is their evolution
in time. A rapid pace of change may signify, for example, that the
principles of a disease are not properly defined. A disease model
whose elements have a high turnover rate requires a greater
effort at understanding and leaves less time to devote to its
details. In the case of the disease X, the appearance of B in the
publication record was unexpected, which in Bayesian probabil—
ity terms can be expressed as p(BeX’,+1 | X/,) = 0. On the other
hand, articles about A were fully anticipated, p(A eX/,+1 |
X ’, ) = 1. Thus, conditional probabilities can be used to gauge
the rate of change in a disease model and the novelty of a ﬁnding.

The bigenes example is about an organism with only two genes
(like some simple viruses), but a similar case could have been
made about an organism with only two cell types because
research emphasis on cell types also changes over time. For
example, much immunological research has been focused on
the T—cell subsets Th1 and Th2, but, recently, there has been
increased emphasis on Th17 and Treg cells, whereas new cell
types, such as Th9 and Th22, are regularly proposed. In this ana—
lysis, we have considered disease models not only involving genes
(as in the bigenes example) but also cell types, drugs and chem—
icals, and we have looked at how they inﬂuence each other.

2 METHODS

Disease literature data came from Medline 2012 release abstracts anno-
tated with at least one disease MeSH term (branch C of the MeSH Tree
Structures, which covers human and animal diseases) and published
between 1970 and 2010. Disease groups were based on the main sub-
branches of the disease MeSH tree. Gene, cell type, drug and chemical
annotations came from GeneView [(Thomas et al., 2012); download July
2012]. GeneView uses the GNAT (Hakenberg et al., 2011) algorithm for
gene recognition, which showed 82% precision and 82% recall for
abstracts in the BioCreative challenge, and which has been extended to
20 model species. Chemical entity annotations in GeneView come from
ChemSpot (Rocktaschel et al., 2012), which achieves 68% precision and
69.5% recall. Cell types and drugs are based on the AliBaba (Plake et al.,
2006) dictionaries of regular expressions and spelling variations.

For each disease in the MeSH Tree Structures, an ordered sequence
was created X), = {xk,1,xk,2,xk,3,  where each X“ is the name of a
gene mentioned in an abstract annotated with the MeSH term corres-
ponding to disease k. Each sequence X A. was ordered by publication time.
That is, for every X“, there is an associated time stamp I“ for which
IA.~ ,» 5 t,”- if i 5 j. The time stamp was based on the publication date of the
abstract. For publication dates that only specify month and/or year, the
earliest possible date was assigned (e.g. the ﬁrst day of the month). For
publications appearing on the same date, the PubMed ID value was used

conclusions that are unsupported by the available data, as well as
heterogeneity in the quality of the data, could interplay with the
complexity we are measuring or add another layer to the prob—
lem. Beyond these scientiﬁc factors, non—scientiﬁc ones such as
regulatory and legislative problems or patenting issues can loom
large for certain diseases.

Ultimately, complexity should be considered primarily as caus—
ing a tangible impact to the input factors necessary for scientific
research (time, money, patients, etc.). In this light, the need for
better understanding is highly relevant, considering the stagnat—
ing pace of pharmaceutical research despite the abundance of
incentives to improve existing therapies.

Structural alignment quality using data compression

 

Because this traditional approach of formulating a scoring
function has been explored extensively over the last four decades,
further development along the same lines is unlikely to provide
any major breakthrough. Therefore, this ﬁeld will stand to bene—
fit by departing from the traditional approaches and exploring
radically new ones. This paper is a step in this direction.

Structural alignment as an inductive inference problem. The
goal of inductive inference is to propose a theory (or hypothesis)
that is able to best explain the observed data. Structural align—
ment can thus be seen an instance of the general class of inference
problems. In this context, an alignment (i.e. residueiresidue cor—
respondence) is a hypothesis that attempts to explain the residuei
residue relationships between two protein structures, whose
observed data is the (x, y, z) coordinates of the structures.

In general, any hypothesis has a certain (descriptive) complex—
ity. A complex hypothesis with more free parameters can predict
(or fit, explain) a greater variety of observed data than a simpler
hypothesis. Therefore, in order to choose the best hypothesis for
any inference problem, one is confronted with a trade—oﬂ
between hypothesis complexity and its fit with the observations.

For structural alignments, this trade—off is related to the con—
ﬂict between coverage and fidelity. Coverage (in various forms
handled in the current scoring functions) is a crude approxima—
tion of the (alignment) hypothesis complexity. Similarly, the fi—
delity (or goodness of fit with the observed data) of a structural
alignment is approximated using RMSD of superposition or
using some distance measure. These rudimentary approxima—
tions cause the existing scoring functions to introduce several
tunable parameters in an attempt to balance the contributions
between coverage and fidelity of structural alignments. This has
been a major source of the inconsistencies observed in
alignments.

The field of statistical learning and inference provides rigorous
approaches to address this trade—off systematically. In the early
1960s, several landmark papers proposed links between inductive
inference and information theory (Kolmogorov, 1965;
Solomonoff, 1960; Wallace and Boulton, 1968). The Minimum
Message Length (MML) principle (Wallace and Boulton, 1968)
provided the first practical information—theoretic criterion for
hypothesis selection based on observations. It is used here to
rigorously assess structural alignment quality and reliably differ—
entiate between competing alignments.

Structural alignment quality and lossless information compres-
sion. The pioneering work of Claude E. Shannon (Shannon,
1948) provides the means to quantify information: the length
of the shortest code required to transmit, losslessly, an observed
event. This can be understood as the length of the shortest mes—
sage needed to communicate the event losslessly between an im—
aginary sender (Alice) and receiver (Bob).

In this context, the structural alignment problem can be
rationalized as a communication process between Alice and
Bob, where Alice has access to the (x, y, z) coordinates of two
protein structures and she wants to encode and transmit this
information to Bob losslessly. Two possible scenarios then
arise: (i) If the two are unrelated to each other structurally,
Alice cannot do better than to encode and transmit the informa—
tion of the two structures independently, one after another. That
is, knowledge of one structure (called reference, or S) does not
provide information about the other (called target, or T) and,

thus, knowledge of S cannot be used to compress T. This form of
independent transmission is termed here as the null model mes—
sage. (ii) On the other hand, if the two structures are structurally
related (i.e. there is a meaningful alignment between the two),
knowledge of S reveals information about T. The more similar
the structures, the more information one reveals about the other.
Alice can use this similarity to compress and transmit the infor—
mation of the target structure using the information of the ref—
erence. For Bob to decode the information of the target losslessly
(i.e. to the precision with which Alice sees it), he will require the
structural information of the reference structure plus the infor—
mation of its proposed relationship (i.e. the structural alignment)
with the target. This will allow Alice to encode the target more
concisely than stating the target structure using a null model. We
call this form of transmission, the alignment model message (to
contrast it with the null model message, where the structures are
transmitted independently).

We note that this information—theoretic framework for struc—
tural alignment is intuitive. If the proposed alignment relation—
ship is a poor one, then the encoded alignment model message
will be inefficient (i.e. long). Alternatively, if the alignment rela—
tionship is a good one, then the transmission of the target be—
comes efficient (i.e. short). Therefore, the total message length of
the lossless transmission of coordinate information (using an
alignment hypothesis) forms an excellent measure to assess struc—
tural alignment quality. It follows that the best alignment is the
one with the shortest total message length of lossless transmission.

While we have intuitively rationalized this framework as a
communication process, this message paradigm is also backed
by mathematical rigour. Formally, let A denote some alignment
between structural coordinates S and T. Using the product rule
of probability over three events A, S and T we have:

P(A&S&T) =P(A) >< P(SIA) >< P(T|S&A)
=P(A) >< P(S) >< P(T|S&A)

where P(A&S&T) gives the joint probability of alignment A for
structures S and T, P(A) the prior probability of the alignment,
P(T|S&A) the likelihood of T given S and A. Note, P(S IA) is
P(S) because S and A are assumed to be independent.

Shannon’s mathematical theory of communication (Shannon,
1948) gives the relationship between the shortest message length
I(E) to communicate losslessly any observation E, and its prob—
ability P(E) as I(E) = — log (P(E). Technically, I(E) denotes the
Shannon information content of E.

Restating equation 1 in terms of information content, we
obtain:

(1)

I(A&S&T) = I(A) + 1(5) + 1( TI S&A) (2)

where transmitting the information of the reference structure S
takes I(S) bits, transmitting the alignment information takes I(A)
bits and transmitting the information of the target structure T
using A and S takes I(T|S&A) bits.

Our message length measure has the following three key prop—
erties, which are not achieved by previous scoring functions:

(1) The difference between the lengths of the messages needed
to transmit the structures S and T using any two align—
ments, gives their log—odds posterior ratio.

As a result, any two competing alignment hypotheses A1
and A2 can now be compared based on their message
lengths. Therefore, the best alignment hypothesis A" is
the one that results in the shortest message length value
of I(A*&S&T).

(2) Our measure permits a natural null hypothesis test where
the statistical signiﬁcance of any proposed alignment hy—
pothesis can be estimated. Any alignment hypothesis A
whose message length I(A&S&T) is worse (longer) than
that of the null model message, I(S&T) =I(S)+ I(T), must
be rejected.

(3) This measure provides an objective, formal trade—off be—
tween the complexity of the alignment (I(A)) and the ﬁ—
delity of the structures given the proposed alignment
(I(T|S&A)). Unlike previous attempts, these terms are
not ad hoc approximations, as they represent rigorous es—
timations of Shannon information content based on loss—
less encoding and compression.

2 METHODS

2.1 Computation of the null model message length

The null model message corresponds to the transmission of protein co-
ordinates without an alignment hypothesis. (In this work, we consider
only the Ca coordinates.) We have previously deﬁned [for a completely
different problem (Konagurthu et al., 2012)] a null model encoding of
coordinates along a protein chain. We will brieﬂy summarize this ap-
proach, as elements of this encoding are used and developed further in
our current work.

The null model encoding relies on the observation that the distance
between successive Ca atoms in a protein chain is highly constrained to
3.8 :l: 0.2 (s.d.) A. For a chain of coordinates {171,172, . . . ,pn}, any coord-
inate pit] can be transmitted given the previous 17,-, by ﬁrst transmitting
the distance r,- between 17,- and pit] using a normal distribution N (r; u, a)
stated to e = 0.001 A accuracy, with p, = 3.8 A and a: :l: 0.2 A. (e = 0.001
reﬂects the precision of statement of coordinate data, which is three places
after the decimal point as reported in the protein data bank.). We repre-
sent the length of this encoding as I(rl»). With this information trans-
mitted, Bob now knows that pit] lies on a sphere of radius r,- centred
at 17,-, but does not yet know where exactly on the sphere it is. Assuming
that pit] is distributed uniformly over the surface of the sphere, trans-
mitter Alice can discretize the sphere’s surface into cells, each of area 62.
Using this discretization, pit] can be transmitted as cell number cit].
The numbering convention of the discretization is in the shared
codebook. With the knowledge of 17,-, r,- and c,-, Bob can
reconstruct pit] to the stated accuracy. Stating the cell number takes

I(cl») = — log  = log 2(4711‘?) — 210g 26 bits.

When sending a chain of Ca coordinates {171,172, . . . ,p,,} over a null
model message, we assume that p, is the origin and, hence, does not need
to be transmitted as part of the message. Even if 171 is not assumed to be
the origin, its encoding will add a fixed one-time cost to the message
length. Thus, to transmit the chain of points 171,172, . . . , 17,, over the null
model, Alice needs to send to Bob the number n of Ca atoms in the chain,
followed by incrementally transmitting (using the method above) p2 given

171, [)3 given p2 and so on, until all coordinates are transmitted. Alice can
transmit the number n over a integer distribution. Wallace and Patrick
(1993) gave an efﬁcient code (Iimcgcr(n)) for transmitting any positive in-
teger n > 0.

Therefore, the total message length required to send all the coord-

inates over the null model message takes Inuu(p1, . . . ,p,,)=Iimcgcr(n)+
71
1 (I(rl») + 1(a)) bits.
Using the above, the coordinates of structures S= {S1, S2, . . . , SS}
and T: {T1, T2, . . . , T‘T‘} are sent as independent chains of coordinates

over the null model, taking Inu“(S&T) = Inu“(S) + Inuu(T) bits.

2.2 Computation of the alignment model message length

Equation 2 gives the amount of information required to transmit the
coordinates of structures S and T using the alignment hypothesis A.
To estimate this, the explanation message involves transmitting: the
coordinates of S, the residueiresidue correspondences proposed by
the alignment in A and, ﬁnally, the coordinates of T using the informa-
tion of S and A.

2.2.] Transmitting the coordinates of S This is achieved by sending
the coordinates of S = {S1, S2, . . . , S‘S‘} over the null model. Therefore,
I(S):Inu“(S1 , Sz, . . . , S‘S‘) bits.

2.2.2 Transmitting the correspondences in A Any alignment can be
described as a string switching between three states: match (‘m’), insertion
(‘i’) and deletion ((1’) states. This alignment string can be transmitted
losslessly using a first-order Markov model.

To transmit an alignment over a 3-state Markov chain, we use an
approach similar to the adaptive encoding method used by Wallace and
Boulton (1969) over a multinomial (n-state) distribution. The adaptive
encoding here requires maintaining nine running counters, one for each
possible transition probability, all initialized to 1. Traversing the align-
ment string left to right, for every observed transition, Alice estimates its
probability by dividing the current value of the corresponding transition
counter by the sum of all counters from previous to any state. After the
probability is estimated, Alice encodes the current alignment state using
this probability and then increments the corresponding counter by 1. The
code length to encode each state is the negative logarithm of its estimated
probability. Summing each transition over the entire alignment gives the
code length, I(A).

2.2.3 Transmitting the coordinates of T given S and A With
the information of S and A known to Bob, Alice can now use that in-
formation to encode the coordinate information of T. Intuitively, our
encoding is based on the fact that when scanning A from left to right,
Alice views T as runs of coordinates that alternate between blocks of
insertions and matches with respect to S and the stated alignment.
Note that all deletion blocks (with respect to S) in T are ignored as
they contain no information to be transmitted about T. More formally,
let A yield {1 1, . . . ,Im} insertion blocks, where any IA. represents a con-
secutive stretch of coordinates that are inserted in T (with respect to S).
Each insertion block is transmitted as a null message taking
1mm 5&A) = 2:; 1 lane/outs.

What remains to be sent to Bob are the coordinates in T aligned to
corresponding coordinates in S, that is, the matches. Let {Sm S,»,, . . . , Sin}
and {7}“7},,...,7}”} where 15i1<...i,,5|S| and
1 5 j] < . . .j,, 5 |T|, denote the ordered set of corresponding coordinates
in S and T, respectively. Bob already knows S and the alignment. From
the alignment information he can infer the indexes of the aligned residuei
residue correspondences: (i1, jl), (i2, jz),  (in, j”) between S and T.
Thus, Alice can use the following procedure to transmit the aligned co-
ordinates in T. To start the procedure, the first three matched coordinates
of {T1- Th, T1,} are sent over the null model message taking: Ismup(T|S

&A) = Inuu(T,-l , T,-,, T,-,)bits. Alice then incrementally sends the remaining
aligned coordinates of T as follows. To transmit the current aligned co-

ordinate wa, Alice considers only the set of (previous plus current)
aligned coordinates {T/l, T,-,,   Tim}. This set is orthogonally
transformed to the set {Tl-l, Tb,  , Th1, Tim }, such that it minimizes

the least-square error between {S,-|,  SA} and {T,-I,  TM}. Using
this setup, Alice can transmit Tim over a directional distribution on a
sphere. This is achieved by ﬁrst transmitting the radius rt. = HTMH — Tjk ||
over a normal distribution with the same procedure described for formu-
lating a null model message. This allows Alice to state Th1 H as a point on
a sphere with radius rk centred at TM. However, we do not state it over a
uniform distribution (which would make it a null model description), as
the knowledge of correspondence of T)“. with Sim gives clues about its
position on the sphere (provided the assigned correspondence is a ‘good’
one). Because Bob already knows the corresponding point Sim , after
transmitting rk, Alice can use a directional probability distribution to
state Tim more concisely. In directional statistics, the von Misesi
Fisher distribution gives the probability density function (PDF) on the
surface of any sphere in p-dimensions. In three dimensions, the PDF on
the surface of a unit sphere is (Fisher, 1953; Mardia and Jupp, 1999):
wanwkmew _

Using this distribution to transmit Tim, we compute am as the
direction cosines of the vector Th1 H —T/k, and [14.11 as the direction
cosines of the vector Sim — TM . The probability of stating Tim to the
required precision (that is, e=0.001  precision on each component)
using von MisesiFisher distribution over the surface of a 3D sphere of

K“ "‘ where 6’2

unit radius is then given by: Papalme =  ac-
counting for the scaling of the sphere of radius r, to a unit sphere.
Transmission of each Tim requires the concentration parameter K. We
use the maximum-likelihood estimator based on the available superpos-
ition [see Mardia and Jupp (1999)]. Therefore, the code length to state x
using von MisesiFisher is: 1mm = — log (P(x)) bits.

Each Tim is transmitted iteratively over this procedure, which we term
adaptive superposition. Thus, the message length required to transmit the

matched points in T with respect to their corresponding point in S is
Imurlssm) = 1mm,p(rls&,4) + 27:4 Add.) bits. Combining the
message lengths of transmitting coordinates in the insertion and matched
blocks gives I(T|S&A) = IinS(T|S&A) + Immh(T|S&A) bits. An illustra-
tion of this procedure is shown in Figure 1.

2.3 Measure of alignment quality

I(A&S&T) is used as the measure of alignment quality. We call this
measure I-value, indicating a value measuring the information content
in the structural coordinates of S and T, given the structural alignment A
as a model of compression. The smaller the I-value, the better the align-
ment. It follows that for competing alignments A1 and A2, if the I-value
of A1 is smaller than that of A2 by, for example, 15 bits, then A1 is
215 times more likely than A2 (see property 1 of this measure shown
in Equation 3). Further, any alignment A for which I(S&T&A)>
1m,“(S&T) = 1m,“(S) + Inuu(T) can be rejected (see property 2 of this meas-
ure under ‘Structural alignment quality and lossless information
compression’).

Handling shifts and rotations. So far we estimated the I-value under the
rigid model of structural alignment. This model can be generalised to
handle plastic deformations commonly observed in protein evolution,
such as hinge rotations and shifts. Handling these deformations requires
a modiﬁcation in the way I(T|S&A) is estimated under a ﬂexible model of
transmission.

Without loss of generality, assume that Tcontains a certain number of
shifts and rotations, with respect to S, associated with its residues. In
computing I(T|S&A), alignment A is partitioned at the residues in T
about which the shifts and rotations are deﬁned. For example, consider
below an alignment containing a hinge rotation about residue 10 of T

matched residues in T(in blue) incrementally given the knowledge of S (in
black). Both structures have 8 points and are assumed here to be in one-to-
one correspondence. Assume that Bob already knows the ﬁrst 3 points of
T. Alice sends the fourth point in Tby superposing all previously matched
points between the two structures. (Green crosshairs shows the rotational
centre of superposition.) This orients the fourth point (in red) in T [or,
more generally, Tim , whose deviation from its corresponding S,- can be

encoded over a von MisesiFisher spherical distribution (see main text)]

(marked by *). Then, the alignment can be partitioned into two separate
parts as follows:
* l l
123 4567890123 123 45 567890123
S --XXX---XXXXXXXXXX --XXX---XX XXXXXXXXX
T XXXXXXXXXX---XXXXX = XXXXXXXXXX + X---XXXXX

1234567890 12345 1234567890 0 12345
1 1 1
Let these partial alignments be denoted as A(T1,...,T10) and

A(T10,...,T15), identifying the start and end residue indexes in T
about which the partition is deﬁned. Then I(T|S&A) is computed as
I(T|S&A(T1, . . ., T10))+I(T|S&A(T10, . . . , T15)) using the procedure
described earlier. More generally, if there are k residues in T about
which shifts/rotations are deﬁned, the full alignment A is parti-

tioned into k + 1 partial alignments: A(T1, . . . , Til ). A(T,-l , . . . , T,-,), . . . ,
A(T,-,U . . ., Tm), where i1<i2<  <ik< |T|. Given these partitions,
I(T|S&A) can be computed as I(T|S&A(T1. . . . , Til)) +  +I(T|S&
A(ik, . . ., |T|)). This immediately poses another inference question:

Given an alignment A of S and T, how many shifted/rotated residues
does it contain? We note that adding a shift/hinge has an overhead
which must pay for itself with a better ﬁt if it is to be accepted.

Inference of shifted/rotated residues: A dynamic programming algo-
rithm is used to optimally partition A minimizing I( T|S&A).

The algorithm ﬁrst constructs a matrix M of size |T| >< |T| such that
each cell M(i,_]') (1 5 i<j 5 |T|) stores the value I(T|S&A(i, . . . ,_i)). The
best partition of A is then computed using the following dynamic pro-
gramming recurrence relationship:

, 1'71 M(1i.i)i
73(1, . . . ,_])= mm (4)

’:1 73(l,...,i)+M(i,j) Vlgjngl
where any 73(1, . . . , i) gives the optimal partitioning up to the ith residue
in T, 1 5 i 5 |T|. At the end of this procedure the value 73(1, . . . , |T|)

gives the component message length I(T|S&A) of Equation 2, in a way
that handles shift and hinge rotations.

2.4 The time complexity of computing I—value

Using the rigid model of transmission (i.e.without handling the hinge-
rotations and shift), the computation of I(A&S&T) is linear in the size of

Fig. 3. Sieving of the two ambiguous alignments reported by Zu-Kang and Sippl (1996) for the pair lRCF and 3CHY. The X-axis gives the RMSD of
each sieved alignment, while the Y-axis gives the scoring function used: (a) DALI, (b) TM-Score and (c) I-value. The labels in the ﬁgures correspond to
the NEquiv values during sieving. For the TM-Score plot (b), the horizontal dotted line is the threshold for fold-level relationship. For the I-value plot
(c), the horizontal line corresponds to the NULL model message length. The sieved alignments below this line are statistically signiﬁcant

shows that a very large majority of alignments produced by
DALI and TM—Align and scored using I—value are seen to be
statistically signiﬁcant (i.e. with NulliI—value message length > 0),
with DALI alignments being more reliable than those generated
by TM—Align, judging by the compression gain at the level of
their respective medians. Interestingly, I—value seems to provide
the smallest of variations when comparing the results obtained

for the alignments generated by DALI to those generated by
TM—Align.

Upon closer inspection, the results of our experiment indicate
a signiﬁcant degree of disagreement between the respective
scores: only in 28% of the 2500 pivot—versus—counterpart align—
ments, all three scores agree on whether the alignment produced
by DALI or by TM—Align is the best. This disagreement

highlights the need for a generally accepted, rigorous alignment
score. Supplementary Table S2 in the online supplementary ma—
terial shows the full list of disagreeing pairs.

Our second experiment uses the set of ambiguous alignments
described by Zu—Kang and Sippl (1996), as case studies for the
various scoring functions ability to differentiate between very clo—
sely competing alignments. These alignments are indistinguish—
able in RMSD and number of equivalences (NEquiv). Table 1
compares the three scoring functions across ﬁve pairs of ambigu—
ous structural alignments. For each scoring function, the better
score of the two alignments for each pair is highlighted in bold. We
again observe disagreement in two out of the five pairs between
the scoring functions in their ability to decide which of the two
alignments is the best. We emphasize that this discrimination is
crucial for any scoring function to be useful as the basis of a search
method looking for the optimal alignment.

Let us illustrate the problems in using some of these scoring func—
tions for an optimal alignment search method, using the case study of
pair 3CHY v. lRCF. To do so we ‘sieve’ each of the two ambiguous
alignments using the following procedure, similar to the one
described in Irving et al. (2001), to generate a number of competing
alignments at varying levels of NEquiv and RMSD: (i) Compute the
[NEquiv, RMSD] and corresponding DALI, TM—Score and I—value
of the current alignment. (ii) Delete the worst—ﬁtting aligned pair that
appears at the end of a ‘matched block’ in the alignment, and force
the deleted pair of residues to be unaligned. (iii) Repeat from Step 1
until the RMSD falls below a threshold value.

Studying the three sieving plots corresponding to DALI, TM—
Score and I—value in Figure 3, it is immediately clear that TM—
Score (Fig. 3b) does not produce any clear optima for this set of
competing alignments to choose from. In fact, TM—Score mono—
tonically increases towards the TM—scores of the unsieved align—
ments. On the other hand, I—value and the DALI score produce
clear, though conﬂicting optima. I—value points to an optima for
the sieved Alignment 1 at [NEquiv,RMSD] of [101,3.7 A],
whereas DALI points at [94, 3.17 A]. (Superpositions based on
these two alignments can be found in the online supplementary
material.) This reﬂects the standard dilemma human experts and
scoring functions face in choosing between two conﬂicting ob—
jectives. However, I—value objectively discriminates between the
two competing alignments in terms of the lossless compression
achieved. We emphasize that compression takes into account all
aspects of the trade—ofinescriptive complexity of the alignment
hypothesis versus the quality of ﬁt of the alignment to the struc—
tural dataithat manifests in the structural alignment problem.

Finally, as a proof of concept, we have also developed a quad—
ratic—time dynamic programming heuristic to search for the op—
timum I—value alignment. Currently this alignment heuristic is
restricted to the rigid (and not ﬂexible) model of computing
the component message length [(71 S. A). Details of the heuristic
search are beyond the scope of the current article, given the page
limitations. Our implementation of this alignment heuristic based
on I—value is available for use from our website.

4 CONCLUSONS

The importance of finding biologically meaningful structural
alignments has led to the intensive development of methods for

generating alignments and evaluating their quality. However,
these methods produce conﬂicting results and none has been
generally accepted as clearly superior.

Here we have described a measure of alignment quality,
I—value, that uses the information content of messages that loss—
lessly compress the Cat atoms of a pair of protein structures,
given a proposed alignment. A lower I—value signiﬁes a superior
alignment. The method contains no adjustable parameters, as it is
built on a formal Bayesian principle of minimum message length
inference.

Examination of competing alignments over many pairs of pro—
tein structures demonstrates that I—value can accurately distin—
guish between competing structural alignments in cases in which
other methods either cannot signiﬁcantly distinguish the quality
of these possibilities, or do not agree in the selection of a best
one.

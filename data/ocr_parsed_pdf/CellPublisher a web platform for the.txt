ABSTRACT

Summary: Systems biology relies increasingly on collaborations
between several groups with different expertise. Therefore, the
systems biology community is adopting standards that allow
effective communication of concepts, as well as transmission and
processing of pathway information. The Systems Biology Graphical
Notation (SBGN) is a graphical language for biological pathways
that has both a biological as well as a computational meaning.
The program CellDesigner allows the codification of biological
phenomena in an SBGN compliant form. CellPublisher is a web
server that allows the conversion of CellDesigner files to web-based
navigatable diagrams based on the user interface of Google maps.
Thus, CellPublisher complements CellDesigner by facilitating the
understanding of complex diagrams and by providing the possibility
to share any CellDesigner diagram online with collaborators and get
their feedback. Due to the intuitive interface of the online diagrams,
CellPublisher serves as a basis for discovery of novel properties of
the modelled networks.

1 INTRODUCTION

The detailed understanding of biological pathways and the design
of novel molecular pathways with engineered properties lies at the
core of systems biology. To meet these goals, two complementary
approaches are combined in modelling: simulation and graphical
representation. While the former aims to mimic the behaviour of the
pathway in silico, the latter aims to make the pathway properties
and structure understandable to humans.

The pace of discovery in systems biology has been greatly
accelerated by the adoption of standards by the community
(e.g. SBML). The Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN,
Le Novere et (11., 2009) is likely to become the standard for graphical
representation. Adequate software tools such as CellDesigner
(Funahashi et (11., 2008) are freely available and actively used.

While several online databases such as KEGG, BioCyc,
Reactome, Panther, Pathway projector or SubtiPathways exist for
visualizing centrally curated pathways (Bauer-Mehren et (11., 2009;
Kono et (11., 2009), only few of them are adopting a standard
graphical language (e. g. Panther and SubtiPathways; Lammers et (11.,
2010; Mi et (11., 2010). Moreover, as novel pathways are constantly
discovered or designed, there is a speciﬁc need for presenting custom
pathways and receiving feedback from other scientists.

So far, authoring diagrams for online sharing is possible using
the web servers BioPP, Payao and WikiPathways (Kelder et (11.,
2009; Matsuoka et (11., 2010; Viswanathan et (11., 2007). However,
these servers do not allow the generation of easily navigatable
diagrams which are required for the evaluation of pathway maps
by the non-specialist busy lab scientist. With the advent of
Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) technologies in the
web, which have given rise to applications such as Google maps,
the possibilities for navigation of graphical information have been
greatly improved.

To complement the powerful authoring capabilities of
CellDesigner with an improved visualization interface and to
overcome the limitations of the existing pathway presentation tools,
we have developed CellPublisher, a web server for the intuitive
visualization, sharing and discussion of metabolic, signalling and
regulatory pathways based on the interface of Google maps.

2 THE WEB SERVER
2.1 User input

In the design of the input screen, we have focused on making the
submission procedure as fast, simple and intuitive as possible. Apart
from entering the author and title of the pathway, the user is asked
to upload the CellDesigner ﬁle and an image of it. The image can be
exported easily from CellDesigner and can be modiﬁed with other
programs before uploading (see below). Moreover, the user has the
option to enter an e-mail address, to get notiﬁed when the conversion
is ﬁnished.

Upon submission, the user is directed to an admin page with links
to download a local copy of the interactive pathway, and to the
online version of the diagram. Both versions are basically identical,
but the local copy can be modiﬁed further and shared on any web
server. In addition, the admin page includes a link to delete the
pathway, together with all user input. The link to the admin page
can be bookmarked. It is also accessible from the e-mail sent to the
user.

The same ﬁlnctionality of the web server is also available as a
standalone, ‘ofﬂine’ version (Supplementary Material).

Fig. 1. Screenshot of an online diagram. The CellDesigner-based
representation can be navigated like a Google map. Clickable markers appear
on the species at the highest magniﬁcation, which contain the information in
the CellDesigner notes and external links for selected databases.

2.2 Features of the computed diagram

In the pathway navigation interface (Fig. l), the majority of
the screen is devoted to the interactive pathway map. It can
be zoomed in and out with the mouse, and navigated as is
known from Google maps. A bird’s eye View on the lower
right provides orientation on higher magniﬁcations. At the highest
magniﬁcation, all the species include a Clickable marker that opens
a pop-up window with additional information on the species. The
content of the window is directly taken from the notes entered in
CellDesigner.

For the PDB, PubChem Compound, PubMed and Uniprot
databases, an ID entered in the CellDesigner notes will automatically
be linked to the external resource. Moreover, the molecular structure
of species linked to PubChem Compound will be incorporated
in the info window (Fig. 1). Likewise, under Mozilla Firefox,
PDB references will also include a Jmol applet with the 3D
structure.

The map is framed on the right with an ordered list of all species
in it. Clicking on a link in this list will open the pop-up window of
the corresponding species in the map. This is useful to explore the
various places where a species participates in the diagram.

A forum for each pathway can be accessed through the link on the
top right of the page. In this forum, every viewer can give feedback
to all other viewers.

2.3 Sharing of the diagrams

The main purpose of CellPublisher is to provide an easier way
to navigate SBGN compliant diagrams and share them with a
wider audience. We envision at least two scenarios where the
use of CellPublisher is of particular convenience: publishing and
discussion among colleagues and collaborators.

For instance, a publication can cite the link to the online diagram
and it will be immediately accessible to everyone without the need of
installing programs; the use of any modern web browser is sufﬁcient.
The species notes can be enriched with references to other external
sources, such as online databases or web pages with extended

information. As novel information is discovered, the diagrams can
be enriched with comments from the community.

Moreover, the enhanced navigation makes it easier to analyse
and discuss a diagram. For instance, it is easier to upload a diagram
with need of discussion to CellPublisher, and send the URL to the
collaborators, instead of attaching the ﬁill CellDesigner ﬁle.

As mentioned above, the image of the diagram can be
processed with additional programs (e.g. Adobe Photoshop®)
before uploading it to CellPublisher. While preparing a discussion, it
could be useﬁil to mark in some way uncertain areas of the diagram.
These marks will be visible in the online diagram, something that is
not possible in current CellDesigner versions.

These features can be especially useﬁil in the early phases of
discussion, where an agreement on the pathway connectivity is
necessary. In contrast, Payao (Matsuoka et al., 2010) could be
most useful in later phases, involving the meta-annotation of the
individual components by curation experts.

An additional level of customization can be achieved with the
local version, which can be obtained from the admin page or
the ofﬂine version. The look-and-feel and the interactivity can be
adapted to speciﬁc needs and the resulting pathway can be uploaded
to any server. This customization of CellPublisher diagrams is
exempliﬁed by SubtiPathways, a collection of diagrams covering
metabolism and gene regulation in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis
(http://subtipathways.uni-goettingen.de; Lammers et al., 2010).

3 CONCLUSION

As the complexity of the studied pathways increases, the encoded
diagrams themselves will increase in size and complexity. This
requires software that makes the diagrams understandable in
spite of their size. In addition, sharing pathway information with
collaborators in a graphical way becomes increasingly important, as
well as receiving comments by the community.

CellPublisher is perfectly suited for this task due to its
combination of intuitive visualization, the possibility to process
custom-made diagrams, the forum for each pathway and free
availability via a web browser.

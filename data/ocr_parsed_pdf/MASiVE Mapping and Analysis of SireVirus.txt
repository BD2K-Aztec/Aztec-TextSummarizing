ABSTRACT

Summary: We present MASiVE, an expertly built tool for the
large-scale, yet sensitive and highly accurate, discovery, preliminary
analysis and insertion age estimation of intact SireVirus LTR-
retrotransposons in plant genomic sequences. Validation was based
on the recently available and annotated large maize chromosome
one. Results show a considerable improvement in the annotation of
Sireviruses, and support our approach as an important addition to
the bioinformatics toolbox of plant biologists.

Availability: PERL source code and essential files are available
online at http://bat.ina.certh.gr/tools/masive/. The freely available
Vmatch, LTRharvest, Wise2, and MAFFT algorithms are required.

1 INTRODUCTION

The availability of large and complex plant genome sequences
has necessitated the development of algorithms that can facilitate
high-throughput discovery and annotation of transposable elements,
especially long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTN) that
comprise the majority of these genomes (Schnable et al.,
2009). Tools like LTR_STRUC (McCarthy and McDonald, 2003),
LTR_FTNDER (Xu and Wang, 2007) and LTRharvest (Ellinghaus
et (11., 2008) are available; however, they are all based on
general structural characteristics of LTR-RTNs, which may lead to
misannotations or incomplete identiﬁcation of the LTR-RTN set. The
recent discovery that the abundant and plant-speciﬁc Sireviruses
contain highly conserved motifs in key domains of their genome
(Bousios et al., 2010) provided the opportunity to develop MASiVE
(Mapping and Analysis of SireVirus Elements), presented herein,
a tool able to identify, with high precision and sensitivity, intact
SireVirus elements in plant genomic sequences.

All LTR-RTNs contain polypurine tract (PPT) and primer binding
site (PBS) domains. However, their high sequence and length
plasticities (Bousios et al., 2010) render them inappropriate for
the identiﬁcation of a speciﬁc retrotransposon class. In contrast,
Sireviruses have multiple identical PPTs at the upstream border of

the 3’LTR and a highly conserved S’LTR/intemal domain junction
that includes part of the PBS. These, along with several ﬁlters applied
sequentially, are used by MASiVE to target ﬁill-length SireVirus
elements, while excluding false positives like other retrotransposons
or non-retroelement-derived sequences resembling the structure of
LTR-RTNs. MASiVE has been calibrated and validated in the largest
chromosome of the now available, and expertly annotated, Zea mays
(maize) B73 genome (Schnable et (11., 2009), chromosome one.

2 METHODS

2.1 LTRharvest and the multiple PPT signature ﬁlter

MASiVE (Fig. l) is written in Perl. and makes use of external algorithms:
LTRharvest. Vmatch (www.vmatch.de). Wise2 (Birney et al.. 2004) and
MAFFT (Katoh and Toh. 2008).

Initially. LTRharvest is deployed to scan the genomic sequence for
the presence of LTR-RTNS (see Supplementary Table l for LTRharvest
parameters). MASiVE proceeds by matching the SireVirus-speciﬁc PPT
octamer (AGGGGGAG) and l2-mer (AGGGGGAGATTG) on the genomic
sequence using the Vmatch algorithm. The majority of PPTs cluster within
500 bp of the 3’LTR (Supplementary Fig. 1). while the terminal octarner
is always followed by the conserved ATTG attachment site. Therefore. we
describe the multiple PPT signature as the requirement to ﬁnd at least 2
and a maximum of 15 upstream PPTs and the terminal PPT/attachment site
within 1000 bp (Supplementary Table 2). Since LTRharvest does not search
for PPT-like structures. we can instead use the highly conserved SireVirus

multiple PPT signature and retain. as putative full-length Sireviruses. only
LTRharvest-predicted elements that overlap with a multiple PPT signature.
in our case 3870 candidates.

2.2 PPT500 and PBS500 ﬁlters

2.2.1 PPT500 Misannotations of LTR-RTNS may either include random
sequences. or a fusion of different retroelement fragments in the complex-
nested retrotransposon landscape over long chromosomal regions that is
characteristic of plants with large genomes (Baucom et (11.. 2009). As
the l2-mer of each multiple PPT signature precisely deﬁnes the SireVirus
internal domain/3’LTR junction. if the distance between the l2-mer and the
overlapping LTRharvest-predicted inner side of the 3’ LTR is too long. then it
is highly likely that LTRharvest reported an element-artifact. In 3870 putative
full-length Sireviruses in maize chromosome one. in 85%. 75% and 53% of
the cases the distance between the l2-mer and the 3’ LTR was smaller than
1000. 500 and 100 bp. respectively. Thus. we decided to ﬁlter out elements
with a distance longer than 500 bp (PPT500 ﬁlter).

2.2.2 PBS500 The second strongest sequence pattern of the SireVirus
genome is the 5’ LTR/internal domain junction. The conserved l6-mer
consists of the CAATTGG attachment site and the TATCAGAGC motif
that complements the 3’ end of the mattRNA. Likewise the multiple PPT
signature. the PBS site can be used to reject false positives. In 2895 putative
intact Sireviruses that had passed the PPT500 ﬁlter. the distance between
the l6-mer (with up to three mismatches) and the 3’ side of the 5’ LTR in
95%. 84% and 75% of the elements was shorter than 1000. 500 and 100 bp.
respectively. Thus. we set the threshold at 500 bp (PBS500 ﬁlter).

2.3 Pfam reverse transcriptase ﬁlter

Although it is very likely that elements passing through the PPT500 and
PBS500 ﬁlters represent intact Sireviruses. we also searched for hits of the
Pfam reverse transcriptase domain (PF07727) for Tyl/copia retrotransposons
in the internal region between the two LTRS of the putative Sireviruses.

2.4 PPT20 and PBS20 ﬁlters

These two ﬁlters require the full length elements to possess: (i) a 20-mer
that includes the terminal two nucleotides of the l2-mer PPT in the 2.5-kbp-
long upstream region of the PBS. and (ii) a 20-mer that includes the ﬁrst
two nucleotides of the PBS in the 2.5-kbp-long downstream region of the
PPT (with up to three mismatches for either 20-mer). Importantly. this step
also allows for the determination of the exact LTR borders of the SireVirus
element.

2.5 LTR ﬁlters
Finally. all Sireviruses with (i) LTR lengths of at least 500bp and

(ii) difference between their 3’ and 5’ LTR lengths <500 bp. are placed in
the ﬁnal set of intact Sireviruses.

3 RESULTS
3.1 SireVirus speciﬁcity—the multiple PPT signature

Analysis of the l2-mers and octamers reported by Vmatch revealed
that a large proportion belonged to multiple PPT signatures, which
together with their sequence integrity, denotes the conservation of
this domain and its capacity to be used by MASiVE (Supplementary
Table 3). We also searched for the multiple PPT signatures in non-
plant genomes (human, ﬂy and yeast) with negative results (data
not shown). Moreover, to verify that the multiple PPT signature
is a SireVirus-speciﬁc motif, we isolated 200 bp downstream of
each signature, predicted to be the ﬁrst section of the 3’ LTR, and

compared them to the respective 200bp fragments of the maize
Sireviruses Opie, Ji and Giepum, which comprise nearly 20% of
the maize genome, and of the other annotated maize Tyl/copia
retrotransposons (Baucom et (11 ., 2009). More than 99% of the 6892
sequences clustered with the maize Sireviruses (data not shown),
demonstrating that the vast majority of sequences after the signature
are indeed the 3’ LTR of Sireviruses.

3.2 Effects of ﬁltering and insertion age estimation

The stepwise application of the ﬁlters rejected 2086 elements in
total that did not satisfy the criteria for being categorized as full-
length Sireviruses, resulting in a ﬁnal set of 1784 high-quality
intact Sireviruses (Fig. 1). Analysis along the MASiVE pipeline
of the ﬁill lengths and the lengths of LTRs of the different Sirevirus
populations showed a gradual convergence around the expected
averages (Supplementary Fig. 2) (Baucom et (11., 2009). Finally,
following pairwise alignment of LTRs, an optional capability of
MASiVE, we estimated that Sireviruses in chromosome one of
maize have an average insertion age of 0.92 mya (million years
ago). Apparently, an ampliﬁcation burst occurred ~0.l—0.4 mya
(Supplemenatry Fig. 3).

3.3 Validation

We studied the overlap between our set of ﬁill-length Sirevirus
elements in chromosome one of maize and that recently reported
by the Maize Transposable Element Consortium (MTEC) (Schnable
et (11., 2009). The results (Supplementary Fig. 4) show that MASiVE
not only recovered 76% of the MTEC set (951/1244), but also added
50% more intact elements to the pool (625). In fact, almost 90%
of the MTEC Sireviruses that MASiVE failed to match (293 false
negatives) are actually reported by MASiVE either as multiple PPT
signatures or as problematic elements (thus, potentially fragmented
and ﬁltered out during the MASiVE pipeline).

A look into Arabidopsis thaliana provided no mentionable results
due to the degeneracy of the Endovir family (nearly all elements
are fragmented), and thus the very low abundance of LTR-RTN
retrotransposons in this small-genome plant.

4 CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

Based on highly detailed genome structure information speciﬁc for
Sireviruses, we developed MASiVE, a method which we show is
able to discover, with high sensitivity and even higher precision,
intact Sireviruses in plant genomic sequences. MASiVE can also
provide detailed information on Sireviruses that failed the successive
ﬁlters, therefore expanding the view on the genome distribution of
Sirevirus elements. Currently, the method is based on LTRharvest
results, but we plan to remove this requirement since the multiple
PPT signature appear to be powerful enough to support MASiVE
on its own. Finally, the Sirevirus population can be further parsed
by available tools that conduct detailed annotation of LTR-RTN
genomes (Sperber et (11., 2007). We believe MASiVE to be a valuable
addition to the methodological arsenal for scientists interested in
untangling the intriguineg complex genome landscape of plants.

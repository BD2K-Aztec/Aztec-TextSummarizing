ABSTRACT

Summary: Since tens of millions of chemical compounds have
been accumulated in public chemical databases, fast comprehensive
computational methods to predict interactions between chemical
compounds and proteins are needed for virtual screening of
lead compounds. Previously, we proposed a novel method for
predicting protein—chemical interactions using two-layer Support
Vector Machine classifiers that require only readily available
biochemical data, i.e. amino acid sequences of proteins and structure
formulas of chemical compounds.

In this article, the method has been implemented as the COPICAT
web service, with an easy-to-use front-end interface. Users can
simply submit a protein—chemical interaction prediction job using
a pre-trained classifier, or can even train their own classification
model by uploading training data. COPICAT’s fast and accurate
computational prediction has enhanced lead compound discovery
against a database of tens of millions of chemical compounds,
implying that the search space for drug discovery is extended by
>1000 times compared with currently well-used high-throughput
screening methodologies.

Availability: The COPICAT server is available at http://copicat.dna
.bio.keio.ac.jp. All functions, including the prediction function are
freely available via anonymous login without registration. Registered
users, however, can use the system more intensively.

1 INTRODUCTION

Due to the limitations in experimental methods for determining
interactions between proteins and chemical compounds, a
comprehensive computational approach is useful in the early stages
of the drug discovery process. Although 3D structure-based methods
such as docking analysis (Morris et al., 1998) have been studied
intensively in this ﬁeld, they are still time-consuming and not really
feasible for genome-wide application.

To address the problem, we developed a comprehensively
applicable statistical prediction method for interactions between
any protein and chemical compound, that requires only protein

sequence data and chemical structure data and utilizes the statistical
learning method of Support Vector Machines (SVM) (Nagamine
and Sakaldbara, 2007; Nagamine et al., 2009). We have shown the
usefulness of our approach in searching potential ligands binding to
human androgen receptors from >19 million chemical compounds
and verifying these predictions by in vitro binding (Nagamine et al.,
2009).

2 METHODS AND IMPLEMENTATION

We approach the problem as binary classiﬁcation of proteinichemical pairs
whose abstractive identities are represented numerically. An amino acid
sequence of protein is converted to a multi-dimensional feature vector
representing trimer frequencies, while a chemical compound is converted
to a feature vector representing frequencies of substructure occurrences in
the structural formula.

We obtained a ‘positive’ sample set, i.e. a set of proteinichemical pairs that
have been proven to interact with each other via biological assays, from the
DrugBank database (Wishart et al., 2008). In addition, SVM-based classiﬁers
require a ‘negative’ sample set, containing proteinichemical pairs that do
not interact with each other, which can be extracted randomly from the
complement set of the positive sample set. Using the resultant positive and
negative proteinichemical pair sets, we trained two-layer SVMs. First, we
trained each of the multiple ﬁrst-layer SVMs with small sample sets designed
using different criteria. Next, using another larger sample set, we trained a
second-layer SVM whose input is a set of probabilities output from the
ﬁrst-layer SVMs.

The prediction performances were evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation
using the DrugBank database. Sensitivity, speciﬁcity, precision and accuracy
values obtained are 0.954, 0.999, 0.984 and 0.997 respectively. Details of
the algorithms and their prediction accuracy are given in Nagamine and
Sakakibara (2007) and Nagamine at al. (2009).

The prediction method has been implemented as the web-based software
system COPICAT (COmprehensive Predictor of Interactions between
Chemical compounds And Target proteins), available as the COPICAT web
service. The core SVM modules of COPICAT use LIBSVM (Chang and Lin,
2011) with the rest of the system written mainly in Perl and C++. The web
interface is built using Java Servlets, Apache Tomcat and MySQL. COPICAT
integrates SVM-based prediction programs and associated large databases of
proteins and chemical compounds.

3 COPICAT WEB SERVER AND FEATURES

The COPICAT web service offers easy use of the programs
without having to download the code, store huge datasets or
execute the programs on computationally intensive CPUs with large
memories.

Prediction job: user chooses ‘Prediction’ from the side menu and
submits the user’s input data consisting of pairs of proteins and
chemical compounds. The prediction result is returned as a list
of protein—chemical pairs with classiﬁcation labels ‘1 (interact)’
or ‘—1 (non interact)’ and their probabilities. Each protein and
chemical compound is linked to a UniProt or PubChem database
entry.

Prediction against databases: the COPICAT web service performs
a prediction job against a database by receiving the user’s
chemical compound or protein data as a query and returning the
prediction results against all molecules in one of the system-side
databases. The following databases are available for use in the
predictions: ‘Ensembl’ (79,063 entries), ‘RefSeq’ (39,107 entries),
‘DrugBank Approved Drug Targets’ (456 entries), ‘DrugBank
Approved Structure’ (964 entries) and ‘PubChem (23,130,811
entries)’. Prediction against PubChem is realized as a specialized
ﬁinction ‘Chemical—BLAST’.

Training job: when a user uploads his own training data, an SVM
trained with the user data is added to the pre-deﬁned ﬁrst-layer SVMs
and then the second-layer SVM is re—trained using the augmented
ﬁrst-layer outputs.

(1) Sample data: the default positive samples were obtained from
DrugBank. In addition, users can upload their own positive
samples.

(2) First-layer model addition: users can choose to add pre-trained
models to the ﬁrst layer in three ways: (i) the user’s own
previously trained model. (ii) the system-side specialized
models: ‘Nuclear Receptor’, ‘Ion Channel’, ‘GPCR’, and
‘Enzyme’. (iii) other user trained models via the model
circulation function.

Circulation of user-trained models: COPICAT web service provides
a ﬁinction to circulate a user-trained model to other users wishing to
combine the model with their own two-layer model. In this ﬁinction,

each user-trained model is assigned a model ID. Users, who are
allowed to access the model, can reload the model through the ID
certiﬁcation process.

Job example: a prediction job with ‘doparnine receptor’ (UniProt ID:
P21728) submitted against ‘DrugBank Approved Structures’ returns
the prediction result containing 22 candidate compounds such as
CID:5440 (Thiethylperazine, a dopamine antagonist), CID:28864
(Lisuride) and CID:681 (Dopamine) each of which is linked to the
PubChem database, as shown in Figure 1.

Prediction accuracy: we tested the accuracy of prediction jobs
against databases. In prediction jobs against ‘DrugBank Approved
Drug Targets’ with a query of every Drugbank approved structure,
99.9% of the known true target proteins were listed as the ﬁrst rank
(highest probability) except multiple targets.

Abstract

Motivation: Several efficient gene—gene interaction tests have been developed for unrelated case—
control samples in genome—wide association studies (GWAS), making it possible to test tens of billions
of interaction pairs of single—nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a reasonable timeframe. However,
current family—based gene—gene interaction tests are computationally expensive and are not applicable
to genome—wide interaction analysis.

Results: We developed an efficient family—based gene—gene interaction test, GCORE, for trios
(i.e. two parents and one affected sib). The GCORE compares interlocus correlations at two SNPs
between the transmitted and non—transmitted alleles. We used simulation studies to compare the statis—
tical properties such as type I error rates and power for the GCORE with several other family—based
interaction tests under various scenarios. We applied the GCORE to a family—based GWAS for autism
consisting of approximately 2000 trios. Testing a total of 22 471 383 013 interaction pairs in the GWAS
can be finished in 36 h by the GCORE without large—scale computing resources, demonstrating that the
test is practical for genome—wide gene—gene interaction analysis in trios.

Availability and implementation: GCORE is implemented with C++ and is available at http://
gscore.sourceforge.net.

1 Introduction Two major challenges are faced when performing interaction

analysis in GWAS. The first is the computational burden resulting

Genome—wide association studies (GWAS) have been widely used in
complex disease studies to identify the association of single—nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) with the disease. Although GWAS have suc—
cessfully identified many significant SNPs, most SNPs exhibit modest
effects on the disease and can only explain a small proportion of the
heritability of the disease (Manolio et (11., 2009). As complex diseases
are caused by the joint effects of multiple genes, gene—gene inter—
actions may also play an important role in disease etiology.
Significant gene—gene interactions have been identified for several dis—
eases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, autism and schizophrenia (Ebbert
et (11., 2014; Gasso et (11., 2010; Ma et (11., 2005). Therefore, it is im—
portant to develop powerful and efficient gene—gene interaction meth—
ods for GWAS.

from tens of billions of tests when considering all possible pairwise
interactions between SNPs. Several computationally efficient algo—
rithms have been developed for pairwise interaction analysis for
case—control GWAS, such as the fast epistasis test implemented in
PLINK (Purcell et (11., 2007), SNPHarvester (Yang et (11., 2009),
SNPRuler (Wan et (11., 2010), BOOST (Wan et (11., 2010) and
TEAM (Zhang et (11., 2010). The second challenge is the multiple—
testing correction burden resulting from the extremely large number
of tests. To achieve genome—wide significance for these interaction
tests, a large sample size or strong interaction effects between SNPs
are required.

Several gene—gene interaction methods have also been developed
for family—based association studies. For families with at least one

affected and unaffected child, conditional logistic regression (CLR)
and logistic regression based on generalized estimating equations
(GEE) (Zeger et (11., 1988) can be used for testing interactions
(Hancock et (11., 2007). CLR has further been extended to accommo—
date families with one affected child and two parents (i.e. trios),
using the affected offspring as a case and ‘pseudocontrols’ created
based on the parental genotypes (Cordell et (11., 2004). UNPHASED
is a likelihood ratio test that can be used for testing interactions
by comparing the likelihoods of genotypes given the disease status
with and without modeling the interaction (Dudbridge, 2008).
Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) (Ritchie et (11., 2001),
a machine—learning method developed for case—control studies, has
been extended to several family—based interaction tests, such as
MDR—PDT (Martin et (11., 2006), PGMDR (Chen et (11., 2011) and
FAM—MDR (Cattaert et (11., 2010). A summary of tools available for
gene—gene interaction analysis is shown in Table 1 and a more de—
tailed overview of these tools can be found in the Supplementary
Materials. Also more comprehensive reviews of gene—gene inter—
action methods can be found in some review papers (Cordell, 2009;
Niel et (11., 2015). As shown in Table 1, current family—based inter—
action methods are applicable to only candidate gene regions.
Iterative algorithms such as the Newton—Raphson method are used
in parameter estimations in CLR or GEE, as well as in the likelihood
ratio tests. MDR—based approaches use cross—validation for model
evaluation and permutations to approximate the distributions
of the test statistics. These algorithms require intensive calculations.
Hence, these tests would not be applicable for analyzing genome—
wide interactions with tens of billions of tests.

We developed an efficient gene—gene interaction test which con—
siders correlations in trios (GCORE). The GCORE is extended from
the fast epistasis test in PLINK. The GCORE statistic compares inter—
locus correlations at two SNPs between the transmitted and non—
transmitted alleles. We used theoretical distributions to model the
statistic and calculate the variance and covariance. Thus, the test does
not use any iterative algorithms, ensuring that the test is fast and ap—
plicable to genome—wide interaction studies. We performed a compre—
hensive simulation study to evaluate the type I error rates for the
GCORE and other gene—gene interaction tests capable of analyzing
family data with available software, including GEE, UNPHASED and
MDR—PDT. Simulations were also used to compare the power of the
GCORE with the three tests under various scenarios. Our simulation
results suggest that the GCORE can be used as a screening tool to effi—
ciently identify the potential pairs of SNPs with interaction effects,

and other tests with higher power such as the likelihood ratio test im—
plemented in UNPHASED can be further used to evaluate the signifi—
cance of the SNP pairs. Finally, we applied the GCORE to a family—
based GWAS for autism to screen all possible pairs of SNPs within
genes, and UNPHASED was used to further test the pairs of SNPs
identified by the GCORE.

2 Methods

We first reviewed the PLINK (Purcell et (11., 2007) interaction statis—
tic in the Supplementary Materials and then introduced the GCORE
test statistic.

2.1 The GCORE statistic

Assume we have n trios, and we are testing the interaction for two
SNPs M1, with alleles A and a, and M2, with alleles B and b. Here
we loosely define a haplotype as a set of alleles at the two SNPs (e.g.
AB, Ab, dB or ab), where the two SNPs can be on different
chromosomes.

Similar to the Transmission Disequilibrium Test (TDT)
(Spielman et (11., 1993), we calculate the transmitted (T) and non—
transmitted (NT) haplotype statistics, as shown in Table 2. Each
parent has two haplotypes, one that is transmitted and one that
isn’t. In Table 2, let each cell count be the number of parents who
transmitted a haplotype and did not transmit another haplotype to
the affected child. For example, 7111 is the number of parents with
the transmitted haplotype AB and the non—transmitted haplotype
AB. Since the sum of all cell counts is 271 and Table 2 includes all
possible outcomes of the parental haplotypes, the cell counts in
Table 2 follow a multinomial distribution. In order to calculate the
odds ratios for the T and NT statistics, Table 2 is reorganized into 2
X 2 tables, shown in Tables 3 and 4, by taking the marginal count
of the T or NT statistics for each haplotype. The T and NT statistics
are used as cases and controls, respectively, in families.

Based on Tables 3 and 4, the odds ratios between the two SNPs,
M1 and M2, for cases (i.e. T) and controls (i.e. NT) can be calculated
as follows:

Similar to the PLINK approach, the GCORE statistic for the
gene—gene interaction test compares the difference in the log odds
ratios between cases and controls. Assume that [3’1 and [3; are the
sample estimators for the odds ratios OR”,e and ORmmmj, respect—
ively. The GCORE statistic G is calculated as follows:

C; l1°g(31)-1°g(32)l
War [10g (39} + Warped/12)] _ 2cm, [10g (3,) , 10g (32)]

(3)

 

 

Under the null hypothesis that there is no interaction between the
two SNPs, log (ORcase) : log (ORcommj) : 0 when the two SNPs are
in LE. When there is a correlation between alleles at the two SNPs,
which can be caused by linkage disequilibrium (LD) or population
stratification, log (ORcase) : log (ORmmml) 9E 0 under the null.
Therefore, under the null, the GCORE statistic G follows a normal
distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The
PLINK statistic ZPLINK was designed for unrelated case—control data.
Thus, the variance of the difference in the two log odds ratios is the
sum of the variance for the individual log odds ratios. However, the
odds ratios in the GCORE statistic are statistically correlated due to
the correlation in families. Thus, the covariance between the two log
odds ratios is considered in calculating the variance for the difference
in the two log odds ratios. A similar approach to calculating the co—
variance of two correlated odds ratios as proposed in Bagos (2012)
was used. The detailed derivation for the variance is given in the
Supplementary Materials.

Constructing Table 2 requires knowledge of the haplotype phases
in the trios. There are several sophisticated and efficient haplotype
phasing programs for trios, such as Merlin (Abecasis et al., 2002),
BEAGLE (Browning and Browning, 2009) and SHAPEIT (Delaneau
et al., 2012). One of these programs can be used to resolve the haplo—
type phases in the sample before running the GCORE. Moreover, the
GCORE does not assume LE between SNPs, given that the haplotype
phases are known, but assumes that the haplotype frequencies for
haplotypes at the two SNPs are in HWE. Ueki and Cordell (2012)
showed that inferring haplotype phases can introduce extra variance
in the interaction statistic and ignoring the variance may cause the in—
ﬂation of type I error rates for the interaction tests in unrelated case—
control data. Because the variance of inferring haplotype phases is not
considered in the GCORE statistic, we used simulations to evaluate
the type I error rates for the GCORE test when the haplotype phases
were inferred based on the tested family data.

2.2 Simulations
We conducted a comprehensive simulation study to evaluate the
type I error rates and power for the GCORE and other interaction

tests with available software, including the interaction test based on
logistic regression with GEE, UNPHASED and MDR—PDT, under
different scenarios.

We used the simulation tool, SeqSIMLA2 (Chung et al., 2015),
to generate trios. Note that there are other simulation tools such as
genomeSIMLA (Edwards et al., 2008) and simuPOP (Peng and
Amos, 2008) that can simulate gene—gene interaction effects of
SNPs on disease in families. However, SeqSIMLA2 is ﬂexible of
adopting external reference haplotypes simulated under realistic
human genetic structures. To produce the reference haplotypes, we
used HAPGEN2 (Su et al., 2011) to simulate 10 000 haplotypes in
two randomly selected 5 MB regions on chromosomes 1 and 2 simi—
lar to the allele frequencies and LD structures in the Utah Residents
(CEPH) with Northern and Western European Ancestry (CEU) sam—
ples from the 1000 Genomes Project (Consortium, 2010) data.
Using the 10 000 haplotypes, SeqSIMLA2 performed gene dropping
to generate trios, while trios with affected children were ascertained.
We selected the following logistic function as the penetrance func—
tion in SeqSIMLA2:

exp (p + A.ij + Azxz + A3X1X2)
P Aff x x 2 4
( wed) 1’ 2) 1 + exp (p + xx, + 22x; + 23x1x2) ( )

 

where X1 and X; are coding of genotypes based on an additive,
dominant or recessive model for the two disease SNPs, p determines
the disease prevalence, l1 and 2; represent the effect sizes of the
main effects for the disease SNPs, and 23 determines the interaction
effect for the two disease SNPs.

As the GCORE requires phased data, Merlin was used to resolve
haplotype phases in the trios for all the simulation scenarios. The
haplotypes corresponding to the most likely gene ﬂow pattern were
used (with the—best option in Merlin). The type I error rates were first
evaluated by selecting two unlinked loci on the two chromosomes
with no interaction effects on the disease. We considered six different
sets of minor allele frequencies (MAFs) for the two selected SNPs (i.e.
0.05, 0.05; 0.05, 0.2; 0.1, 0.1; 0.2, 0.2; 0.2, 0.4; and 0.4, 0.4) and
three different numbers of trios (i.e. 500, 1000 and 2000). When inter—
actions for two SNPs on the same chromosome are tested, there may
be LD between the two SNPs. Thus, we also tested two SNPs in differ—
ent degrees of LD (LD measures 1’2: 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7) to evaluate
the type I error rates. The presence of main effects but no interaction
effects may inﬂate the type I error rates for interaction tests (Hu et al.,
2014; Ueki and Cordell, 2012). Therefore, we also evaluated the type
I error rates in the presence of only main effects under different disease
prevalences (0.01, 0.05 and 0.1) and disease models (recessive, addi—
tive and dominant models). We simulated a scenario where only one
main effect (21 : ln(2),l; : 0) was present, and a scenario where
two main effects were present for two different effect sizes
(21 : In (1.5), A; : ln(1.5); 21 : ln (2), A; : ln  Finally, we eval—
uated the type I error rates for the GCORE in the presence of popula—
tion stratification. The details of the simulations can be found in the
Supplementary Materials. Each type I error rate was calculated over
5000 replicates of simulated samples.

For the power comparisons, we simulated two unlinked loci on the
two chromosomes that have interaction effects on the disease. The
power was calculated with significance levels of 0.05 and 0.01 using
1000 replicates of samples. The parameters we considered in the power
simulations included the number of trios (i.e. 500, 1000 and 2000),
sets of MAFs (i.e. 0.2, 0.2; 0.2, 0.4; and 0.4, 0.4) and sets of effect sizes
(i.e. xil : xi; : 0,xig : ln(1.5); xi1: xi; : 0,xig : ln(1.75); xil : xi;
: 0, i3 : ln (2)). The default settings in our power simulations
were 1000 trios, MAFs of 0.2 and 0.2 for the two disease loci, and

21 : 0, A; : 0,23 : ln(1.5). We changed one parameter at a time for
each of the scenarios.

3 Implementation

Although the calculation of the GCORE test statistic is fast, using
the GCORE to test tens of billions of SNP pairs for a GWAS dataset
remains very time consuming. Two strategies were used to improve
the analysis efficiency in the GCORE program. POSIX Threads
(Pthreads) in UNIX are used to parallelize the tests running on a ma—
chine with multiple cores. Moreover, the user can specify the
chromosome pair so that the GCORE will test SNP pairs only be—
tween the specified chromosomes. Therefore, tests for different
chromosome pairs can be performed on different computers, such as
in a cluster environment.

At present, GEE is mostly implemented in R, which is not com—
parable for performance with the GCORE. Instead, we used the
epistasis test in PLINK, which is also implemented in C++ and
is based on logistic regression, assuming that all samples were inde—
pendent. The GEE procedure typically runs a regular logistic regres—
sion, assuming that all observations are independent, to obtain
initial estimates of the parameters. Therefore, we expected that the
run time for GEE implemented in C ++ would be longer than
the PLINK epistasis test based on logistic regression. We estimated
the run time for testing 4 500 000, 22 500 000 and 45 000 000 SNP
pairs in 1000 trios on a LINUX server with Xeon 2.0 GHz CPU and
24 GB RAM. The run time for the GCORE included the time it took
to run Merlin for resolving the haplotype phases, a Perl script to
transform the Merlin output file to the GCORE input file, and the
GCORE tests.

4 Results

4.1 Type I error rates

The type I error rates under different simulation scenarios are shown
in Tables 5—7 and their 95% confidence intervals are shown in
Tables S4, S6 and S7 in the Supplementary Materials. Table 5 shows
the type I error estimates for different sets of MAFs at the two SNPs
in 1000 trios at two significance levels (01 : 0.05 and 0.01), while the
type I error rates for different sets of MAFs in 500 and 2000 trios
are shown in Table S5 in the Supplementary Materials. All of the
tests had appropriate type I error rates that were close to the nom—
inal levels when both SNPs had an MAFZ 0.2. However, the type I
error rates for GEE and UNPHASED were inﬂated for SNP pairs
with MAFs < 0.2, while the GCORE was conservative in these scen—
arios. This is not surprising as GEE, UNPHASED and the GCORE
all rely on the asymptotic assumption of a normal or chi—square dis—
tribution for hypothesis testing, and the assumption can be violated
for small samples. In contrast, MDR—PDT maintained appropriate
type I error rates across the whole spectrum of MAFs in our simula—
tions, as the permutation test is valid for small samples.

Table 6 shows the type I error rates at different levels of LD be—
tween a pair of tested SNPs. GEE and MDR—PDT maintained appro—
priate type I error rates with different levels of LD. The GCORE
maintained proper type I error rates when the LD was not strong
(i.e. 1’2 : 0.3 and 0.1); however, the type I error rates for the
GCORE can be inﬂated if the LD 1’2 between the two SNPs is 20.5.
On the other hand, UNPHASED is liberal for all levels of LD.
Therefore, the GCORE and UNPHASED are suitable for testing
SNP pairs that are not in LD.

Table 7 shows the type I error rates for the GCORE, GEE and
UNPHASED when the SNPs have main effects but no interaction ef—
fects under an additive model. The results for the dominant and re—
cessive models are shown in Table S8 in the Supplementary
Materials. The type I error rate for MDR—PDT was not evaluated in
this scenario as the null hypothesis for MDR—PDT includes the as—
sumption that the two SNPs have no main effects (Edwards et al.,
2010). If only one SNP had a strong main effect (21 :ln(2), 2;:0),
the type I error rates for the GCORE and GEE were generally close
to the 0.05 nominal level across different disease prevalences and
disease models, while the type I error rates for UNPHASED were
somewhat inﬂated. Moreover, the type I error rates for the three
tests can be inﬂated when both SNPs have strong main effects
(21 :ln(2), A;:ln(2)), particularly under the dominant model, and

the degree of inﬂation increased with higher prevalence. The results
were consistent with previous findings for unrelated cases and con—
trols that strong main effects of the SNPs being tested can inﬂate the
type I error rates for interaction tests based on logistic regression or
comparing odds ratios (Hu et al., 2014). In the presence of popula—
tion stratification, the GCORE maintained proper type I error rates,
as shown in Table S9 in the Supplementary Materials.

4.2 Power

Figure 1 shows the power comparison under different interaction ef—
fect sizes, numbers of trios and MAFs. Similar power patterns were
observed in these scenarios. That is, MDR—PDT had the highest
power, followed closely by UNPHASED. The power for the
GCORE was lower than the power for MDR—PDT and
UNPHASED, but higher than GEE. As expected, the power for all
methods increased with larger effect size, larger number of trios and
higher MAFs.

4.3 Performance comparison

Figure 2 shows the run time plot for the GCORE and PLINK. A
clear advantage of the GCORE in terms of run time over PLINK can
be observed in the plot. For example, the total run time of the
GCORE for testing 4 500 000 pairs of SNPs was about 11min,
while the run time for PLINK was about 4 h 12 min. Therefore, the
GCORE ran 20 times more efficient than a logistic regression based
test for interaction. As GEE requires more time than the logistic re—
gression test, the GCORE is expected to run more than 20 times
faster than GEE. Moreover, when the GCORE tests were performed
in parallel using 10 cores, the run time was 2 min and 22 s for testing
the same number of SNP pairs as before. We did not compare the
run time of the GCORE with UNPHASED, which is also imple—
mented in C ++, because of its computational complexity. For ex—
ample, UNPHASED required an hour and 10 min for testing only
1000 pairs of SNPs in 1000 trios.

4.4 A two—stage genome—wide pairwise interaction
strategy

A two—stage approach has been described in the PLINK user manual
for a genome—wide gene—gene interaction study for case—control
GWAS. That is, the PLINK fast epistasis test can be used as a screen—
ing tool for identifying a potential subset of interaction pairs of
SNPs using a less stringent p—value threshold. Then a standard test

such as the test based on logistic regression can be used to test the
subset of SNPs, and the significance of the tests is determined based
on the genome—wide significance threshold. Similarly, the GCORE
can be used as a screening tool for a family—based genome—wide
interaction study. The results from our power studies suggest that
MDR—PDT is the most powerful test across different scenarios.
However, a large number of permutations is required in MDR—PDT
to obtain a small p—value (e.g. 10710). In contrast, the p—value in
UNPHASED is rapidly calculated from a chi—square distribution.
Because UNPHASED shows comparable power to MDR—PDT in
several scenarios, UNPHASED is suitable to be used in the second
stage to evaluate the significant pairs identified by the GCORE.
Figure 3 shows the power comparisons between the two—stage strat—
egy using different P—value thresholds and UNPHASED. More de—
tails about the simulations can be found in the Supplementary
Materials. As seen in the Figure, the power for the two—stage strat—
egy based on the GCORE P—value threshold of 1073 is close to the
power for UNPHASED. However, the power for the two—stage strat—
egy using the GCORE P—value threshold of 1075 can be significantly
lower than the power for UNPHASED.

4.5 Real data analysis

We applied the two—stage genome—wide interaction analysis strategy
to a family—based GWAS for autism from the Autism Genome
Project (AGP) (Anney et al., 2010; Autism Genome Project et al.,
2007; Pinto et al., 2010). The dataset contained nuclear families
with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) sampled in two stages from
Europe and North America. The stage 1 dataset consisted of ap—
proximately 1400 ASD families genotyped on the Illumina Infinium
1 M—single SNP array, and the stage 2 dataset consisted of 1301
ASD families genotyped on either the Illumina Infinium 1 M—single
or the 1 M—duo array. The data from both stages were combined in
our analysis. The same quality control (QC) procedures as described
in Anney et al. (Anney et al., 2010) were applied to the data.
Because UNPHASED can be a liberal test for testing SNP pairs with
MAFs < 0.2, we removed the SNPs with MAFs < 0.2. After the QC,
there were 1979 trios and 447 187 SNPs. We restricted our analysis
to SNPs within genes. The hg18 gene annotations were downloaded
from the UCSC genome browser website. Interaction tests for all
possible pairs of SNPs that were not in LD between any two genes
were performed using the GCORE, which resulted in 22 471 383
013 tests, and the number of independent tests was estimated as 738
771 507 using the method described in Babron et al. (Babron et al.,
2015). As the simulation results suggest that the power for the two—
stage strategy using the GCORE P—value threshold of 1073 was close
to the power for UNPHASED, the threshold was applied to the ana—
lysis. A total of 21 899 953 pairs with the GCORE P—values < 1073
were tested by UNPHASED in the second stage.

The GCORE was performed in parallel on 10 nodes equipped
with AMD Opteron 2.2GHz CPU and 48 GB of memory, where
each node ran 20 threads, for testing the 22 471 383 013 SNP pairs
in a cluster environment. The analysis was finished in 36 h.
The same resources were used for UNPHASED for testing the 21
899 95 3 SNP pairs in the second stage, and the analysis was finished
in 7 days. However, if the same resources were used for
UNPHASED for testing the 22 471 383 013 pairs of SNPs, more
than 7000 days would be required. This again demonstrates the effi—
ciency of the GCORE test. Table 8 shows the five most significant
pairs identified by the two stage approach. The marginal test P—val—
ues from the TDT are also shown in Table 8. The most significant
interaction was between the SNPs in the neuron—derived

5 Discussion

We proposed an efficient gene—gene interaction test, GCORE, which
considers correlations in trios. A comprehensive simulation study
was conducted to evaluate the properties of the GCORE and other
family—based interaction tests with software available. The compari—
sons of properties between these tests are summarized in Table S10

in the Supplementary Materials. Each test has its advantages and
disadvantages. The main advantage of the GCORE over other tests
is that it can be used to perform a genome—wide interaction study
without large—scale computing resources. In contrast, based on our
real data analysis for the AGP GWAS, thousands of computing
nodes will be required for UNPHASED to finish the genome—wide
interaction analysis within a month. The major disadvantage of the
GCORE is that its power can be significantly lower than MDR—PDT
and UNPHASED in some situations. However, since the significance
threshold is less stringent for the GCORE used as a screening tool,
the type II errors of failing to detect the true interactions can be
reduced for the GCORE.

Although LE for the two tested SNPs is not assumed in the
GCORE, our simulation results showed that the type I error rates
for the GCORE were inﬂated when the LD 1’2 between the two SNPs
was >0.3. Ueki and Cordell (2012) demonstrated that the variance
for the interaction test statistic for case—control samples based on
haplotype frequencies became larger with higher LD levels between
the two SNPs. As haplotype phase inference is not considered in the
variance estimator for the GCORE, this might explain why the type
I error rates for the GCORE were more seriously inﬂated with the
increase of LD levels between the two SNPs.

Our simulation results suggest that the GCORE is robust to
population stratification, which can cause LD between the tested
SNPs. However, if if; was not included in the GCORE statistic,
which reduced the test to a case—only test, the type I error rates can
be seriously inﬂated in this scenario (e.g. type I error rate was 0.72
at the 0.05 level for Scenario 1 in Supplementary Table S9 for SNPs
with MAFs of 0.2). Therefore, i)’; should be included in the GCORE
statistic even for unlinked SNPs so that the type I error rates can be
maintained in the presence of population stratification.

The GCORE was shown to be conservative for testing SNP pairs
with MAFs< 0.2 in samples of 500 and 1000 trios. However, the
GCORE maintained proper type I error rates across different MAFs
in 2000 trios, except that in a SNP pair with MAFs of (0.05, 0.05),
the test was also conservative at the 0.01 significance level. Therefore,
increasing the sample size will allow the GCORE to properly test
SNP pairs with low MAFs. In contrast, UNPHASED and GEE were
more liberal with larger sample size. Hence, the two tests are suitable
for testing SNPs with MAFs 2 0.2. However, SNPs with MAFs lower
than 0.2 may also have interaction effects on complex diseases.
MDR—PDT, which maintained correct type I error rates across differ—
ent MAFs, can be used for testing SNPs with MAFs < 0.2. As MDR—
PDT is computationally intensive, efficient interaction methods that
consider SNPs with low MAFs with high power are desirable for

GWAS. The algorithms developed for rare variants, such as the bur—
den test (Madsen and Browning, 2009) or the sequence kernel associ—
ation test (Wu et al., 201 1), may be extended for interaction tests that
accommodate SNPs with low MAFs.

To demonstrate that the two—stage strategy is computationally feas—
ible in practice, we applied the strategy to the AGP GWAS dataset. The
total run time suggest that this strategy is applicable to genome—wide
interaction analysis in GWAS. Although the interaction pairs identified
by the two—stage strategy were not significant when using the stringent
genome—wide significance threshold, interestingly, the functions of
some genes such as NDNF and neuroligin 1 (NLGN1) in the 5 most
significant pairs are related to functions of neurons. NDNF is a neuro—
trophic factor derived from neurons. NDNF was exclusively expressed
in neurons in a mouse model (Kuang et al., 2010). In addition,
NLGN1 encodes a protein belonging to a family of neuronal cell sur—
face proteins, which may play a role in the formation and remodeling
of central nervous system synapses. More interestingly, copy number
variations in NLGN1 have been founded to be associated with autism
(Glessner et al., 2009). However, the interactions between the genes
have not been reported in the literatures. Further studies are warranted
to evaluate the roles of the interactions of these genes in ASD.

In conclusion, the GCORE test has three promising properties:
it properly considers correlations in families, shows comparable
power with GEE, and is highly efficient. Therefore, the GCORE will
be very useful for testing a very large number of pairs of SNPs in
family—based genome—wide interaction studies.

Combinatorial therapy optimization

 

for optimal combinations in experimental testing is not an easy
task.

Several systematic computational approaches for predicting
drug combinations have recently been developed and could pro—
vide a guide to limit the search space for experimental methods.
For example, Vazquez (2009) proposed identifying the optimal
drug combinations by searching for the minimal number of
drugs that can target all the cancer cell lines using the highest—
degree—ﬁrst and simulated annealing algorithms. However, this
heuristic search algorithm does not have optimum guarantee,
and the convergence rate for large—scale datasets could be slow.
Wu et a]. (2010) integrated a molecular interaction network and
gene expression data of individual drugs to identify subnetworks
affected by individual or combinatorial drugs. The drug effect on
these subnetworks is measured by taking into account both efﬁ—
cacy and side effect and then used to prioritize drug combin—
ations. They successfully identified effective drug combinations
used to treat type 2 diabetes, but the dependency on the avail—
ability of gene expression data treated with individual and com—
binatorial drugs as well as the high computational cost when
handling the vast combinatorial space makes their approach
unsuitable for large—scale application. Zhao et a]. (2011) and
Xu et a]. (2012) proposed two similar computational approaches
to prioritize pairwise drug combinations using feature patterns
enriched in the known drug combinations and got some promis—
ing predictions. However, their approaches rely heavily on the
known drug combination data that are of small size, thus biasing
their predictions toward those combinations that are similar to
the known ones. Therefore, the current computational
approaches are limited, and there is a great need to develop
new algorithms for drug combination prediction.

Drug design is usually speciﬁc, but one drug may target mul—
tiple proteins due to promiscuous binding (Paolini et al., 2006;
Yildirim et al., 2007). One protein can be targeted by multiple
drugs as well. The drugs and proteins form an intricate drugi
target network. When used to treat diseases, a drug can affect
both disease on—target proteins for which it was designed and
some off—target proteins that are not related to the diseases.
When different drugs are combined, there could be a large
number of additive off—targets whose effects are undesired.
Thus, given a set of disease genes, the problem of finding the
optimum drug combinations that maximize on—target coverage
and minimize off—target effects is important and challenging.
This is similar to the efﬁcacy maximization and side effect mini—
mization problem in combinatorial therapy. Also, such off—target
effects in drug combination have not been considered in the sys—
tematic computational studies (Vazquez, 2009; Xu et al., 2012;
Zhao et al., 2011), with the exception of the work (Wu et al.,
2010).

To address the on—target maximization and off—target mini—
mization problem, we first formulated the optimal combinatorial
therapy problem using an optimization framework and solved it
using mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Then, we com—
pared our approach with exhaustive search using simulation and
demonstrated a better performance of our approach over ex—
haustive search. Finally, we demonstrated the good performance
of our approach through searching optimal drug combinations
for six disease gene sets from a drugitarget network. Our ap—
proach not only captured the well—known drugs and drug

combinations, but also suggested novel uses for some other
drugs. The drug combinations discovered using our approach
can target the protein products of disease genes with minimal
perturbations to the other proteins and are worthy of further
testing to treat such diseases. To make our approach more ac—
cessible to the general drug discovery community, we developed
a web—based tool to allow users to iteratively search for optimal
drug combinations from a user—defined gene set.

The remaining part of this article is organized as follows: we
ﬁrst describe the optimization approach in Section 2; application
of the approach on both the simulated and real data is presented
in Section 3; and a brief discussion on current issues and poten—
tial future improvements is described in the concluding section of
the article.

2 METHODS
2.1 Drug—target network

We extracted the drugitarget interactions from the DrugBank database
(version 3.0) (Knox et al., 2011) and constructed a bipartite network, in
which nodes represent drugs or targets and edges represent drugitarget
interactions. We further removed the targets with no human gene symbol
annotation. The remaining network contains 4233 drugs, 2058 target
genes and 9669 drugitarget interactions. We also extracted the adverse
drugﬂrug interaction effects and the drug action information from the
DrugBank database. Given an input disease gene set, drugs with the same
set of targets, actions and interacting drugs were merged into a single
meta-drug, as they are equivalent to our algorithm. Details on drug
data processing are provided in Supplementary Text S1. Unless otherwise
speciﬁed, we used the term drug instead of meta-drug in the remaining
text and the term disease gene to represent the protein product of disease
gene.

2.2 Optimal combinatorial therapy

Given a set of disease genes, we ﬁrst removed those genes that have no
associated drugs in the drugitarget network. The remaining set of disease

genes is called on-target set, denoted as T: {[1, t2, . . . , tp}. We then ex-
tracted the drugs associated with the on-target genes from the drugitarget
network. The set of off-targets, S = {31,32, . . . , sq}, is the set of genes that

are connected with the on-target-associated drugs in the drugitarget net-
work, but does not overlap with T. Mathematically, the associated drugs
can be formulated as M = {MilMi g TU S, i = 1,2, ...,m}, where each
drug M ,- can target some disease genes in Tand some off-target genes in S
as well. Finding the optimal drug combination for a disease is to maxi-
mize the coverage on Tand minimize the overlap with S using a subset of
M. This problem can be deﬁned as follows.

PROBLEM 1.

Balanced Target Set Cover (BTSC) problem. Given a disease
D = (T, S) and a collection of drugs M, ﬁnd a subset C E M and
|C| 5 k that minimize the cost(D,C) = a|T\(UC)| + (1 — oz)|S ﬂ (UC)|,
where U6 2 UCEcC, k is the upper bound on the cardinality of the solu-
tion set C and at is the weight balance of the coverage between on-target
set T and off-target set S.

A natural choice ofoz is 0.5. When at is set to 1, BTSC is equivalent to
the maximum coverage problem. In practice, users may have a small set
of highly conﬁdent drug targets and would require full coverage on these
targets while minimizing the number of off-targets. BTSC cannot be used
directly to solve this problem.

To overcome this limitation, we further propose to fully cover the on-
targets in Tand minimize the number of off-targets in S. In other words,

 

ﬁm'spzumofpiopro'sopeuHOJmorq/ﬁdnq

we require any selected combination of drugs to cover all the on-target
disease genes. This can be achieved by setting at to 0 and adding a con-
straint of full set cover. Mathematically, the restricted problem can be
deﬁned as follows:

PROBLEM 2.

Minimum Off-Target Set Cover (MOTSC) problem. Given a disease
D = (T, S) and a collection of drugs M, ﬁnd a subset C E M that min-
imizes the cost(D, C) = |Sﬂ (UC)|, where |Tﬂ (UC)| = |Tﬂ (UM)| and
UC = UCEC C.

2.3 BTSC and MOTSC problems are NP—hard

The NP-hard property of the BTSC problem can be proved through
reduction mapping. By setting at to 1, the maximum coverage problem
becomes ﬁnding a maximum cover on the disease genes in T using at
most k drugs from M. This reduction shows that BTSC is at least as hard
as the maximum coverage problem, which is in the NP-hard problem set
(Cohen and Katzir, 2008).

MOTSC can be viewed as a modiﬁed version of the Red-Blue Set
Cover, which is also a generalization of the standard set cover problem
(Miettinen, 2009). Red-Blue Set Cover problem is much harder than the
standard set cover problem, and there exists no polynomial approxima-
tion with a factor of 2(410g")l76 for any e>0 (Peleg, 2007).

2.4 Mathematical programming formulation
Mathematically, BTSC can be formulated using MILP as follows:

minimize 01:):(1 —yi)+(1 —cx) 1% yi (1)
[:1 i:p+1
subject to (Bx), — yl’. = 0 (2)
by,» — y; 2 0 (3)
yi — y; S 0 (4)
f X,- 5 k (5)
1:1
(Lx) 5 1 (6)
yl’. e 2+,yi,xj 6 {0,1} (7)

The formulation has three variables, x, y and y’. The ﬁrst two are
binary, and the last one is nonnegative. The binary solution vector x
indicates which drugs are selected. The nonnegative cost variable yl’.
counts the times that the 1}), gene is covered by the selected drugs. The
binary cost vector y is derived from y’, y,» = 1 if yl’. : 1; otherwise, y,» = 0.
The value of y,- indicates whether the 1}), gene is covered. We note that in
vectors y and y’, the ﬁrst 17 elements are associated with the on-target
genes and the next q elements are associated with the off-target genes.

The relation between a given disease D and the associated drugs M
can be represented using a binary matrix B, where the rows are indexed
by the on-targets (p) and off-targets (q), and the columns represent the
drugs. Bi," 2 1 if the 1}), gene in D is covered by the mm drug in M;
otherwise, Bi," 2 0. The nonzero elements in the product vector of B
and x indicate the corresponding genes targeted by a selection of drugs.

The drugidrug adverse interaction effects are encoded in L, a l X m
binary matrix where, for each row k, LA,» 2 ij = 1 if the drugs M,- and
M / have an adverse effect when used together.

The intuition of the MILP formulation is as follows. The equality
constraint (2) counts the number of times that an on-target or an off-
target is covered by the selected drug combination. However, y’ cannot be

directly used in the objective cost function (1). Thus, the binary cost y is
introduced and related to y’ by the inequality constraints (3) and (4). The
inequality constraint (3) requires y,» = 1 if yl’. : 1. For that, the value of b
needs to be at least the maximum value of all yl’. The inequality constraint
(4) guarantees that y,» = 0 whenever yl’. = 0. The maximum number of
drugs for any feasible solution is bounded by the inequality constraint
(5). The inequality constraint (6) guarantees any feasible solution to avoid
the drugﬂrug adverse effects encoded in L. In this article, we solved
BTSC problem using the GNU Linear Programming Kit package
(http://www.gnu.org/software/g1pk/). MOTSC can be formulated simi-
larly (Supplementary Text S2). The dual problems of BTSC and
MOTSC are further discussed in the Supplementary Texts S3 and S4.

2.5 Iterative search and online tool

To make our approach more accessible in practice, we developed a web-
based interactive tool (http://www.drug.1iuz1ab.org/) that will allow users
to iteratively reﬁne the search results. Both BTSC and MOTSC are im-
plemented with the options to ﬁlter out drugs based on approval status,
drugidrug adverse interaction and drug action direction. In addition, our
web tool can also generate the output result ﬁles for Cytoscape visual-
ization (Shannon et al., 2003).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Time complexity and accuracy analysis

To evaluate the time complexity and accuracy of our algorithm,
we compared it with exhaustive search (ES) on a simulated
dataset. According to the formulation in Section 2.4, the simu—
lated dataset is controlled by four parameters: (i) the number of
columns in B, which represents the number of drugs associated
with a disease gene set; (ii) the number of rows in B, which
represents the total on—target and off—target space; (iii) the dens—
ity of B, which represents the percentage of genes targeted by a
drug; and (iv) the value of p, which represents the number of
on—targets.

The ﬁrst parameter, the number of columns in B, is the most
important factor affecting the running time of ES. Therefore, we
generated B by varying the column size from 10 to 30 with a step
size equal to 2. At the same time, the second parameter was set to
1000, and B was sampled from a Bernoulli distribution with
hitting probability equal to 0.01 (the third parameter). In add—
ition, we further removed those rows in B for which the sum
across the columns is equal to 0. We sampled p indexes (the
third parameter) of the rows in B, with a sampling rate equal
to 10%. Then, we simulated the data 10 times with each varying
number of the columns in B, applied BTSC and ES to find
the solution x and compared their differences in the cost and
running time.

Our results demonstrated that there is no difference in the cost
function between the BTSC and ES solutions. However, the
running time of ES increases exponentially, while BTSC tends
to generate the correct results signiﬁcantly faster (Fig. 1). From
these results, we found that ES is impractical even for finding
combinations among a small number of drugs. For example, a
search for combinations among 30 drugs using ES will take ~4.7
days to get the optimal solution. However, BTSC can obtain the
optimal solution within 9 s. We also varied the other three par—
ameters in simulation. There is still no cost difference between
BTSC and ES, and the effects of these three parameters on the
running time difference are much less important than that of the

the Drug Combination Database (DCDB) (Liu et al., 2010).
Using the FDA—approved drug combinations derived from
DCDB, we ﬁrst generated an approximately gold standard data—
set of 68 known associations between disease gene sets and drug
combinations. We then performed search to see the extent to
which these approved drug combinations can be recovered by
our online tool. Totally, 59 of 68 (recovery rate = 86.8%)
approved drug combinations can be fully or partly recovered,
whereas 55 of 68 (recovery rate = 80.9%) approved drug com—
binations can be fully recovered. Details are provided in the
Supplementary Text S6. This result demonstrated that BTSC is
able to identify known drug combinations with high accuracy in
a large scale.

Taken together, these results indicated that BTSC has good
performance in predicting both known and novel drug combin—
ations. In addition, MOTSC identiﬁed similar, but slightly dif—
ferent, drug combinations when applied to the five disease gene
sets that are not fully covered by BTSC (Supplementary Figs
S}S9). The difference between the results of BTSC and
MOTSC further indicated that MOTSC is more applicable if
the user has a speciﬁc requirement on the full coverage of the
input genes. Thus, BTSC and MOTSC provided two comple—
mentary ways to identify optimal drug combination.

4 CONCLUSION

Optimal combinatorial therapy discovery is an important and
challenging problem. In this article, we introduced two comple—
mentary approaches for this problem and solved them using
MILP. There are many heuristic search algorithms that can pro—
vide greedy solutions for this problem. However, we are inter—
ested in finding the global optimum solution, and these heuristic
search algorithms cannot provide such accuracy. Therefore, we
excluded this category of algorithms in solving the optimal com—
binatorial therapy problem and did not compare our approaches
with any heuristic search algorithms. Instead, we compared our
approaches with exhaustive search and demonstrated that our
algorithms can obtain the same optimum solution with much
faster running time. Application of our approach on real disease
gene sets demonstrated its good performance in identifying
known drug combinations as well as predicting novel drug com—
binations. In addition, our approach has the potential to unveil
new functions of existing drugs for drug repositioning.

We have developed an online tool for our proposed algo—
rithms. The online tool provides many features, such as exclusion
of adverse drugidrug interaction, constraint on the number of
drugs, iterative search, highly efﬁcient solver and email notiﬁca—
tion. In addition, the online tool allows the user to assign the
weight balance on the on—target and off—target sets as well as to
choose how to handle drugs with opposite actions on input
genes. The online tool is also ﬂexible to include new constraints,
such as the importance weight of input disease genes and the
penalty weight of potential off—target genes. The availability of
the online tool will make our algorithm accessible not only to the
computational biologists but also to the bench scientists.

The mathematical analysis presented here provides a general
framework for the solution of multi—target therapeutic design.
Although running our algorithm on arbitrarily large set of
drugs is not possible due to the nature of NP—hard problem,

most of the real applications fall into the small and mid—size
categories. In practice, our algorithm and online tool demon—
strate accurate and fast performance on those applications.
One weakness of our approach stems from its use of incomplete
drugitarget interaction data. However, in recent years, a signiﬁ—
cant amount of effort has been devoted to drug target annotation
and prediction. With the improved size and quality of such data,
we believe that our approach and web—based tool will play an
increasing role in drug discovery and development. In addition,
personal variants in protein—coding genes can be easily obtained
with the advances in next—generation sequencing technologies.
Owing to the heterogeneity of complex diseases, even individual
patients with the same disease may have a distinct set of causal
genes and thus will need different treatment strategy. This prob—
lem is challenging and cannot be resolved in an effective way
now. However, our tool offers one way to help predict optimal
drug combination for targeting individual set of disease genes,
which will have a non—trivial contribution to personalized
medicine.

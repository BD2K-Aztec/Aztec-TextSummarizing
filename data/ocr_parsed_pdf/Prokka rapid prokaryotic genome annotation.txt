2.3 Output

Prokka produces 10 ﬁles in the speciﬁed output directory, all
with a common preﬁx. These are described in Table 2.

3 RESULTS

Prokka was designed to be both accurate and fast. To assess
accuracy, we compared the annotations of Prokka, RAST and
xBase2 for the highly curated Escherichia coli K—12 genome. All
methods were told it was an Ecoli genome. Table 3 shows that
Prokka produced an overall better annotation than both RAST
and xBase2. This result could vary for less well—studied or draft
genomes.

Prokka uses parallel processing to decrease running time on
multicore computers. The most time—consuming steps are
BLAST+ and hmmscan, which both support multiple CPUs na—
tively. However, Prokka is more efﬁcient if it runs multiple single
CPU threads on subsets of the data, which it achieves using
GNU parallel (Tange, 2011). Experiments on our 64—core
AMD Opteron server on single genomes show linear speedup
with up to eight cores and sublinear gain thereafter. However,
for much larger bacterial meta—genome datasets, linear speedup
is observed for many more CPUs. To annotate the Ecoli K—12
genome on a typical quad—core desktop computer takes
about 6min.

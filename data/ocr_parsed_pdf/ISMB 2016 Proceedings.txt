inspected by the corresponding Theme Chairs and Area Chairs,
sometimes relying on additional assessments provided by the ori—
ginal reviewers. All 42 submissions were judged to have properly ad—
dressed the concerns of the reviewers and were accepted for the
conference proceedings, resulting in an overall acceptance rate of
42/188222.3%. We believe that this two—tier system, which is
more reflective of typical multiround journal review procedures,
provided a means of ensuring that only the highest quality original
work was accepted within the tight timing constraints imposed by
the conference scheduling. We thank all authors for submitting their
work. These proceedings would simply not be possible without the
scientific ingenuity of the contributors of all the papers. We recog—
nize that the process is not perfect, and some outstanding work
might have been rejected despite our best efforts. Nonetheless, we
are hopeful that all authors received helpful feedback on their work
and that most believe their submissions were judged fairly and dili—
gently. In total, the two—tier review process involved 687 individual

reviews. We are deeply grateful to the Theme Chairs and the Area
Chairs, the members of the program committee and the external
subreviewers for their outstanding efforts in conducting a thorough
review process in just 3 months. Their contribution is at the core of
the scientific quality of the conference. We also thank Steven Leard
for his continuing support with the review process; the team at
Oxford University Press for preparing this special proceedings vol—
ume; and all the other members of the ISMB Steering Committee for
their expert advice and supervision.

Abstract

Motivation: Discovering the relevant therapeutic targets for drug—like molecules, or their unin—
tended ‘off—targets’ that predict adverse drug reactions, is a daunting task by experimental
approaches alone. There is thus a high demand to develop computational methods capable of de—
tecting these potential interacting targets efficiently.

Results: As biologically annotated chemical data are becoming increasingly available, it becomes
feasible to explore such existing knowledge to identify potential ligand—target interactions. Here,
we introduce an online implementation of a recently published computational model for target pre—
diction, TarPred, based on a reference library containing 533 individual targets with 179 807 active
ligands. TarPred accepts interactive graphical input or input in the chemical file format of SMILES.
Given a query compound structure, it provides the top ranked 30 interacting targets. For each of
them, TarPred not only shows the structures of three most similar ligands that are known to inter—
act with the target but also highlights the disease indications associated with the target. This infor—
mation is useful for understanding the mechanisms of action and toxicities of active compounds
and can provide drug repositioning opportunities.

Availability and implementation: TarPred is available at: http://www.dddc.ac.cn/tarpred.

1. Introduction

 

An emerging avenue that brings system biology to drug discovery is
polypharmacology, which hypothesizes that most drugs exert their
effects via multi—target interactions (Hopkins, 2007). Such drug
promiscuity has also led to unwanted and unexplained drug reac—
tions. It is therefore in high demand to develop in silico approaches
for identifying potential biological targets for chemical compounds,

which can be used to: (i) obtain small molecules with optimum
therapeutic effects, (ii) explore ligand—target interactions and their
related biochemical mechanisms and (iii) increase research product—
ivity towards valid drug repositioning. Recently, the rapid growth of
bioassay data volume has brought new opportunities to in silico tar—
get prediction. A plethora of ligand—based target prediction models
has been proposed (Koutsoukas et (11., 2011). For example, the

similarity ensemble approach (SEA) (Keiser et al., 2007) is a fea—
tured one among them that quantitatively estimates pharmaco—
logical relationships of targets by the set similarities of their
respective ligands. These relationships have led to the discovery of
many new uses and side effects for drugs. By compiling a large refer—
ence library containing 533 drug relevant target families, 179 807
individual ligands and a total of 246 053 binding data between
them, we initially developed an efficient and accurate target fishing
scheme using K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)—based data fusion with
molecular similarity searching (Liu et al., 2014). Compared with
SEA, the proposed approach exhibited superior performance on pre—
dicting both therapeutic and ‘off’ targets for the approved drugs
from DrugBank and Therapeutic Target Database (TTD). It also
showed excellent results on other external validations that try to
identify newly reported ligand—target interactions or to predict side
effect targets for drugs withdrawn due to human Ether—a—go—go—
Related Gene (hERG) toxicity. To bring more benefits of this ap—
proach, we here present a user—friendly web application that permits
easy and effective drug targets prediction.

2 Approach and implementation

2.1 Data organization

In addition to target prediction, we also provide associated dis—
eases information for each target, which can in turn be used to
validate the predictions, or to discover potential novel usages
of drugs. The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD)
(Davis et al., 2014) was used for data integration (which provides
gene—disease relationships extracted from the literature), with the
following steps:

1. The target families of TarPred cover 1703 individual protein se—
quences, which were used to perform Basic Local Alignment
Search Tool (BLAST) search for their corresponding genes and
Uniprot gene IDs.

2. Among the 533 target families, 359 were able to ﬁnd their asso—
ciated diseases with direct evidences, where a target is con—
sidered related to a disease if the corresponding genes are
biomarkers of or are in the etiology of the disease.

3. In addition to direct target—disease relationships, diseases predic—
tions for 417 targets using CTD—curated chemical—gene inter—
actions were also provided, where each predicted disease has an
inference score indicating conﬁdence.

2.2. Inputs

Figure 1A shows a screenshot of the landing page of TarPred, which
exposes the access to all major functionalities. TarPred allows users
to input a compound in SMILES format or to draw one using
Marvin JS (http://www.chemax0n.c0m/pr0ducts/marvin/) (Fig. 1B).
The compound is then sent to the server for 3NN fusion score calcu—
lation using JChem command line tools (http://www.chemax0n.
com/products/jchem—base/). The computation takes around 7 min to
complete due to the size of our library, and users can always track
the process of their tasks at results page.

2.3 Outputs

After the computation is completed, users can view an interactive
ranking list containing the top 30 predicted targets with 3NN
scores. For each target, detailed information about its Binding DB
and DrugBank names, Gene IDs, predicted diseases and the pictures
of three nearest compound neighbors to the query compound in the
target ligand set are available. Users can also download the results
in tsv format for post processing and analysis.

3 Case study

Entecavir is a nucleoside analog drug that was used in the treatment
of chronic hepatitis B virus infection by inhibiting DNA polymerase
(Levine et al., 2002). Recent studies revealed that Entecavir also in—
hibits human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)—1 infectivity at clinic—
ally relevant concentrations, as shown by the temporal association
of Entecavir therapy with approximately 1—log 10 reductions in
HIV—1 RNA levels in vivo and in vitro studies (McMahon et al.,
2007). These on—target and off—target interactions of Entecavir can
be successfully captured by TarPred. As shown in Figure 1C, the
DNA polymerase beta is ranked the third, and HIV—1 reverse tran—
scriptase RNAse H is identified at the 10th ranking place. The out—
put target profile for DNA polymerase beta is shown in Figure 1D.

ABSTRACT

Summary: BooleSim (Boolean network simulator) is an open-source
in-browser tool for simulation and manipulation of Boolean networks.
It was developed mainly during Google’s Summer of Code 2012 and
uses the biographer project for network visualization. It can be used
specifically for the modeling of gene regulatory or signal transduction
networks.

Availability and implementation: BooleSim is free software and can
be downloaded from GitHub (https://github.com/matthiasbock/
BooleSim). Online version available at http://rumo.bio|ogie.hu-berlin.

1 INTRODUCTION

Since Kauffman (1969) introduced Boolean networks for biolo-
gical simulations, they are extensively used to describe dynamic
network behavior, especially when networks are big, experimen-
tal data scarce or only qualitatively available [i.e. cell cycle
(Waltermann et al., 2010), signaling (Saez—Rodriguez et al.,
2007) or stem cell differentiation (Flottmann et al., 2012)].
Boolean networks can be Visualized as a graph consisting of a
set of nodes representing the species of the network plus a set of
edges representing the interactions between these species. In
Boolean networks, nodes can only take the discrete values 0
and 1. Biological entities are thus exclusively Viewed as active
or inactive, phosphorylated or unphosphorylated, expressed or
not expressed and nothing in between. This is a simpliﬁcation of
reality, as biochemical species can be present in a continuous
range of concentrations. However, signals are often transmitted
Via threshold crossings. Thus it is often appropriate to discrim-
inate between two statesibelow and above the thresholdi
which have different qualitative characteristics. Transitions
between these states are deﬁned by Boolean logical operations
that can account for activation, inhibition and more complicated
cooperative interactions. Thus the use of Boolean networks in
mathematical modeling of biological processes is justiﬁable by its
practicality (Faure et al., 2006; Waltermann et al., 2010).
Although software packages such as BoolNet for R (Mussel
et al., 2010) or BooleanNet for Python (Albert et al., 2008) are
available to simulate and analyze Boolean networks, these pack-
ages require downloading, installation and a certain basic
knowledge of programing. Moreover, manipulating dynamic

simulations, i.e. changing initial conditions or perturbing a
steady state, often requires advanced scripting abilities.

Therefore, we wrote a simulator that runs Visually in a browser
and does not require downloading or installation. BooleSim, the
Boolean network simulator, supports import of common model
ﬁle formats, model simulation, easy manipulation through on-
click functionality and Visualization of a network’s dynamical
properties as well as export of the Boolean model, graphical
network View and the time series.

2 METHODS AND FUNCTIONALITY

BooleSim supports importing Boolean networks from Python
BooleanNet, R BoolNet and jSBGN (Krause et al., 2013) for-
mats. These are text based and deﬁne the nodes of the network
and the Boolean update rules. During model import, a node is
created for every variable in the model. After that, edges are
created between every two nodes, which inﬂuence each other.
This interaction can be positive, which biologically corresponds
to stimulation or activation, or negative, which corresponds to
inhibition.

BooleSim uses modern web technologies, such as HTML5 and
JavaScript to deliver a highly interactive BooleSim. The network
is rendered as a dynamic scalable vector graphics (SVG), gener-
ated during runtime using the biographer-user interface (UI)
interface (Krause et al., 2013). A force-directed graph layout
algorithm, derived from the d3 gravity/repulsion—based algo-
rithm (http://d3js.org/), arranges the nodes based on the size of
the labels and length of the edges.

The color of each node in the network graph denotes its re-
spective state. Yellow refers to active and blue to inactive states.
A node’s state can be switched by clicking it, nodes can be added
or deleted, whereas Boolean update rules can be edited in a sep-
arate text box tab. This manipulation is internally evaluated,
translated into a new network layout and accounted for in the
next simulation steps.

As simulation progresses, nodes change color in a smooth
transition effect, which is making use of jQuery features
(http://jquery.com/). The simulation stops once a steady state is
reached. In case a system converges into a cyclic attractor, the
simulation continues until the user stops it by clicking the
simulate/pause button.

The evolution of the node’s states can be monitored in the time
series tab: On the left side of the graph, network nodes are listed
in rows. Each column represents the state of the corresponding
node in one iteration, where time is progressing to the right. In
this heatmap representation, yellow represents active and blue

Fig. 1. BooleSim functionality: shown are the demo network [submodel from Flottmann et a]. (2012) as explained in the text] and the heatmap of the
simulation obtained by choking the time series tab and introducing a minimal set of perturbations to ‘reprogram’ the network to a pluripotent state

inactive node states. Beneath its graphical representation of the
time course, the time series heatmap functionality is also helpful
e. g. to identify cyclic attractors.

To enhance interoperability, BooleSim supports exporting
networks to Python BooleanNet or R BoolNet formats, export
to and reimport from biographer’s internal exchange format
jSBGN allowing storing the graph alongside its update rules
together in one ﬁle. The network graph and time series can
also be saved as SVG vector image.

3 RESULTS

To demonstrate our tool, we imported a submodel of a published
probabilistic Boolean network (PBN), describing epigenetic
and transcriptional dynamics in somatic cell reprograming
(Flottmann et al., 2012). To transform the PBN into a determin-
istic Boolean network, we combined the update rules with the
highest probability for every species. Results are shown in
Figure 1.

The time series represents a reprograming process, i.e. the
transition from a differentiated cell lineage A to the pluripotent
cell state and the minimal set of manipulations that were effected
to enable this transition with the simpliﬁed synchronous Boolean
network (see Fig. 1).

4 CONCLUSION

We presented a Boolean modeling tool that is easy to use and
provides users with a qualitative insight into dynamic behavior of
biological networks. As the first tool for that purpose, it has in-
browser functionality and works cross-platform. It enables
usersiwithout the need for downloading but simply by opening
their browser (Chromium recommended) and Visiting the Web
site http://rumo.biologie.hu-berlin.de/boolesim/ito load their
network and perform simulations and manipulations through
clicking on the colored nodes. BooleSim is completely open

source and licensed under the free software license GNU
Affero General Public License (GPL) version 3. Source code
and off-line version are available on the GitHub repository
(https://github.com/matthiasbock/BooleSim).

In the future, BooleSim could be extended to include stochas-
ticity through asynchronous or PBNs, to find attractors or to
represent state spaces.

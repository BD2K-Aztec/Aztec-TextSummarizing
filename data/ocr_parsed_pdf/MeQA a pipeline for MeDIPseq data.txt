ABSTRACT

Motivation: We present a pipeline for the pre-processing, quality
assessment, read distribution and methylation estimation for
methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP)-sequence datasets.
This is the first MeDlP-seq-specific analytic pipeline that starts at the
output of the sequencers. This pipeline will reduce the data analysis
load on staff and allows the easy and straightforward analysis
of sequencing data for DNA methylation. The pipeline integrates
customized scripting and several existing tools, which can deal with
both paired and single end data.

Availability: The package and extensive documentation, and
comparison to public data is available at http://life.tongji.edu.cn/

1 INTRODUCTION

Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) enables the rapid
identiﬁcation of genomic regions containing methylated cytosines.
MeDIP, in combination with hybridization to high-resolution tiling
microarrays or high-throughput sequencing (HTS) techniques, is
a useful method for the identiﬁcation of methylated CpG-rich
sequences (Jacinto et (11., 2008). Recently, several benchmark
publications reported on the use of MeDIP-seq for genome-wide
DNA methylation analysis and compared it to several others
methods, for example, whole-genome bisulﬁte-sequencing (BS-seq)
and methyl-binding protein-based enrichment of methylated
sequences (MBD-seq) (Bock et (11., 2010; Harris et (11., 2010;
Li et (11., 2010). Though MeDIP is not substitute for BS-seq to
obtain a methylome at single-nucleotide resolution, the generation
of genome-wide data derived from MeDIP-seq provides a major
tool for epigenetic studies in health and disease (Harris et (11.,
2010; Li et (11., 2010). Further, MeDIP is speciﬁc for methylated
cytosines and results are not confounded by the presence of
hydroxymethylated cytosines unlike bisulﬁte-based methods. The
main challenges resulting from the rapidly advancing technology
development in DNA methylation analysis is now the computational
analysis of the genome-wide sequencing data (Laird, 2010).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Two methods (Batman and MEDIPS) have been developed
for MeDIP-seq data analysis (Chavez et (11., 2010; Down et (11.,
2008). However, both of them do not include quality control of
sequencing data or the read mapping. These methods require,
therefore, considerable effort to prepare the data and run several
other sequencing and quality control packages separately, increasing
analysis time and potentially introducing processing errors.

To ﬁll the gap between experimental throughput and processing
speed, we developed the MeQA pipeline for pre-processing,
data quality assessment and distribution of sequences reads and
estimation of DNA methylation levels of MeDIP-seq datasets. The
pipeline will also generate ﬁles for the UCSC browser. The pipeline
presented here runs on the Unix/Linux platform and was written in
the popular bioinformatics languages shell script, Python and R. It
can be run locally on a single Linux/Unix or Mac server. We have
tested this pipeline on our cluster with qsub and bsub commands
with excellent performance. On a DELL 16 CPUs (each 2.67 GHz)
and 32 GB memory computer server, it takes ~20 h to run the entire
pipeline for a mouse genome-wide DNA methylation estimate that
contained 20 million 50-bp length single end reads. When several
lanes are combined, which would provide a similar sequencing depth
as HiSeq2000 data, it will take ~30 h. We recommend running this
pipeline on a computer with at least 16 GB memory.

2 METHODS

The execution of MeQA is straightforward and easy. After preparation of the
conﬁguration ﬁle. a simple command line calls the pipeline. We incorporated
several existing computer packages into the MeQA pipeline. As installation
of these packages requires some effort. we prepared a script to install these
packages conveniently.

The pipeline is described in two parts. Each part can be run independently
and be easily exchanged with other software if required. Part A performs the
quality control of the DNA sequence information. First. MeQA provides
a quick overview of sequence problems and data quality can be quickly
assessed since it provides summary graphs. These results are exported to a
pdf—based permanent report. The raw sequence is then aligned to a reference
sequence genome using BWA (Li and Durbin. 2009). The alignments are
saved in the standard SAM format. converted to BAM format and sorted
with SAMtools (Li et al.. 2009). A shell script provides automatic download
of references and index ﬁles from UCSC (Fujita at al.. 2011). or a local
directory can be provided for the alignment to a custom user provided
reference. Quality of the sequence read mapping is accessed by SAMStat.
and results are presented as a HTML report that includes unmapped. as well
as poorly and accurately mapped reads. separately.

Part B deals with the read distribution for different genomic features
and estimates of the DNA methylation level. Methylated mapped region
can be extracted as BED format by SAMtools and BEDtools (Quinlan and
Hall, 2010). These BED ﬁles are supplied to MEDIPS that estimates the
reproducibility of the genome-wide DNA methylation proﬁle with respect to
the total number of given short reads and to the size of the reference genome.
MEDIPS also analyzes the coverage of genome-wide DNA sequence patterns
(e.g. Cst) by the given reads, and calculates a CpG enrichment factor as a
quality control for the immunoprecipitation. For annotation of the methylated
regions, CEAS (Shin et al., 2009) is used to calculate the percentages
of regions that correspond to: (i) promoters, (ii) bidirectional promoters,
(iii) downstream of a gene and (iv) gene (3’UTRs, S’UTRs, coding exons
and introns). Lastly, MEDIPS summarizes the DNA methylation levels for
genome-wide windows of a speciﬁed size or for user-deﬁned regions of
interest.

A ﬂow chart of the analysis pipeline is shown in Figure 1.

3 DISCUSSION

The MeQA pipeline consists of two parts: the ﬁrst one provides
the general quality control of the sequence reads, and the second
assesses the quality of the DNA methylation analysis experiment and
provides comprehensive analysis. The ﬁrst part could in principle

also be applied to other sequence data, e.g. for quality assessment
of RNA-seq data. The MeQA package allows users to obtain
methylation estimates from raw sequence ﬁles with a single python
function call. The main advantage of MeQA is its ease of use and
its availability as open source, as all programs added to the pipeline
are open source programs. Widely used ﬁle formats are used for
each step of the pipeline, e.g. FASTQ, SAM/BAM and BED ﬁles.
Each step of the pipeline can be replaced without compromising
the workﬂow allowing users to update components, replace some
packages and to extend and customize the pipeline for their needs.

This pipeline permits to estimate methylation levels in
differentially methylated regions and genes using MEDIPS. Further
functional analysis such as GO enrichment and KEGG pathway
analysis for differentially methylated genes can be performed using
additional Bioconductor packages.

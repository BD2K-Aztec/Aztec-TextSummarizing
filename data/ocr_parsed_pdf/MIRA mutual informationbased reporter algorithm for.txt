ABSTRACT

Motivation: Discovering the transcriptional regulatory architecture of
the metabolism has been an important topic to understand the impli-
cations of transcriptional fluctuations on metabolism. The reporter
algorithm (RA) was proposed to determine the hot spots in metabolic
networks, around which transcriptional regulation is focused owing to
a disease or a genetic perturbation. Using a z-score-based scoring
scheme, RA calculates the average statistical change in the expres-
sion levels of genes that are neighbors to a target metabolite in the
metabolic network. The RA approach has been used in numerous
studies to analyze cellular responses to the downstream genetic
changes. In this article, we propose a mutual information-based multi-
variate reporter algorithm (MIRA) with the goal of eliminating the fol-
lowing problems in detecting reporter metabolites: (i) conventional
statistical methods suffer from small sample sizes, (ii) as z-score
ranges from minus to plus infinity, calculating average scores can
lead to canceling out opposite effects and (iii) analyzing genes one
by one, then aggregating results can lead to information loss. MIRA is
a multivariate and combinatorial algorithm that calculates the aggre-
gate transcriptional response around a metabolite using mutual infor-
mation. We show that MIRA’s results are biologically sound,
empirically significant and more reliable than RA.

Results: We apply MIRA to gene expression analysis of six knockout
strains of Escherichia coli and show that MIRA captures the underlying
metabolic dynamics of the switch from aerobic to anaerobic respir-
ation. We also apply MIRA to an Autism Spectrum Disorder gene ex-
pression dataset. Results indicate that MIRA reports metabolites that
highly overlap with recently found metabolic biomarkers in the autism
literature. Overall, MIRA is a promising algorithm for detecting meta-
bolic drug targets and understanding the relation between gene
expression and metabolic activity.

language using .NET framework. Project is available upon request.

1 INTRODUCTION

Changes with respect to environmental or genetic modiﬁcations
lead to complex cellular responses. Standing on the top of the
omics hierarchy, metabolomics reflects changes taking place in
the transcriptome and in the genome. These responses are ana-
lyzed by researchers to discover regulatory mechanisms and dy-
namics of cells. Transcriptional responses of the cells, along with

the corresponding metabolic alterations, have been investigated
in various contexts. Some examples are plant research (Brosché
et al., 2005; Carari et al., 2006), diabetes (Ferrara et al., 2008;
Zelezniak et al., 2010), insulin resistance (Jans et al., 2011) and
cancer (Schramm et al., 2010). Functional class-based (Gerstein
and Jansen, 2000; Hughes et al., 2000; Karp et al., 2002; Pavlidjs
et al., 2002; Seshasayee et al., 2009) and proteiniprotein inter-
action network-based analysis of gene expression data
(Chowdhury et al., 2010; Chuang et al., 2007; Goh et al., 2007;
Ideker et al., 2002; Rhodes and Chinnaiyan, 2005) have been well
established. Metabolic network- and metabolic pathway-driven
analysis of transcriptional data have been receiving attention
lately. Efforts have centered on discovering transcriptional regu-
lation architecture of metabolic networks of organisms using
genome-wide association studies (David et al., 2006; Ihmels
et al., 2004; Kharchenko et al., 2005; Tanay et al., 2004).
Various methods with different goals have been developed to
use transcriptomic and metabolic data together in the context
of a metabolic network such as (i) mining for new metabolite-
gene/transcription factor relationships (Ideker et al., 2001; Yeang
et al., 2006), (ii) ﬂux balance analysis and constraint-based mod-
eling of organisms (Covert and Palsson, 2002a, b; Shlomi et al.,
2008) and (iii) using metabolic network topology to identify sig-
niﬁcant changes in related groups of genes (Cakir et al., 2006;
Dec et al., 2010; Dinu et al., 2007; Hancock et al., 2012; Nam
et al., 2009; Oliveira et al., 2008; Patil and Nielsen, 2005;
Subramanian et al., 2005; Ulitsky and Shamir, 2009).

Network topology-based analysis of biological data is a broad
research area (Ma’ayan, 2008). In the context of metabolic net-
works and transcriptomics, the literature so far can be divided
into two subcategories. The ﬁrst type of analysis uses predeﬁned
metabolic pathways as targets for transcriptional regulation and
analyzes the changes in the pathways. Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis (GSEA) is the first and most established analysis in
this subcategory (Subramanian et al., 2005). Improvements
have been proposed in the literature to eliminate the shortcom-
ings of the GSEA approach (Dinu et al., 2007; Draghici et al.,
2007; Hancock et al., 2012). The second type of analysis con-
siders the metabolic network as a whole, and aims to ﬁnd signa-
tures or hot spots in the metabolic network that are subject to
transcriptional regulation (Cakir et al., 2006; Nam et al., 2009;
Patil and Nielsen, 2005; Schramm et al., 2010). The most estab-
lished method in this group is the reporter algorithm (RA; Patil
and Nielsen, 2005). Using the z-score—based method introduced
before (Ideker et al., 2002), the algorithm aims to find metabol-
ites around which transcriptional regulation is centered and link
the complex transcriptional motives to metabolome. Various

extensions and modiﬁcations to the algorithm have been pub-
lished in the literature. For instance, same idea has been used to
discover reporter reactions (Cakir et al., 2006). A similar z-score-
based approach has also been used analyze the rate-limiting steps
of pathways (Nam et al., 2009). In this article, we focus on the
original RA (Patil and Nielsen, 2005) and its scoring mechanism
(Ideker et al., 2002). Our observations, discussed next, also apply
to the extensions of the RA method.

RA ﬁrst maps the differential data onto the enzymes (reac-
tions) in the metabolic network, and then calculates the P-Values
for each gene, using student’s t-test. P-Values are then converted
to z-scores using the inverse normal cumulative distribution
(6"). Equation (1) shows how each p,- is converted to the cor-
responding z-score 2,. Given all samples, z-score measures how
many standard deviations away a P—Value is. It ranges from
negative to positive infinity, where negative infinity corresponds
to no signiﬁcance at all.

Zi=9’l(1—pr) (1)

The z-score 2m for a metabolite m is the aggregation of z-scores
of the k enzymes that are neighbors of m in the metabolic net-
work (through metabolic reactions), and calculated as shown in
Equation (2). The null hypothesis is that the genes adjacent to a
metabolite display their normalized average response by chance.
Should the signiﬁcance of a metabolite need to be determined,
z-score is normalized and converted back into the corresponding
P—Value.

such that enzyme i is a neighbor of metabolite m

(2)

Although RA has been shown to be effective in several different
contexts such as analysis of Type 2 Diabetes (Zelezniak et al.,
2010), genome scale analysis of organisms (David et al., 2008;
Usaite et al., 2009), genome scale analysis of cell lines (Agren
et al., 2012), gene knockout analysis (Holm et al., 2010; Cimini
et al., 2009), targeted pathway analysis (V ongsangnak et al.,
2009), there are some shortcomings that may affect the accuracy
of the algorithm. First, the z-score method uses student’s t-test to
measure the amount of change between two variables. However,
the resulting P-Value is highly dependent on the degrees of free-
dom. It has been shown that, owing to the small number of
samples in cohorts, P-Values may not work as intended (Cicek
et al., 2013). Second, RA uses a univariate approach. That is, it
determines the changes per gene, and does not take dependencies
among genes into account. For a reaction associated with mul-
tiple genes, the gene with the highest z-score is used, and the rest
are discarded (Zelezniak et al., 2010).

In Figure 1A, we illustrate the problem Via an example. The
ﬁgure shows an example from the application of the RA algo-
rithm to compare AarcAAfnr and wild-type (WT) strains of
Escherichia coli (aerobic) in the gene expression dataset (Covert
et al., 2004) (please see Section 2 for details). Genes (pentagons)
are assigned z-scores first, and then the maximum z-score is se-
lected and assigned as the z-score of the reaction (rectangles).

For the reaction copragon transport via ton system, the max-
imum z-score belongs to the gene fhuE (0.88). This scoring ignores
the contribution of the gene tonB, as any z-score value for tonB in

Fig. 1. Application of RA in comparison of AarcAAfnr and WT strains
of E.coli (aerobic). Rectangles represent reactions, pentagons represent
genes and the circle represents the metabolite, copragon. (A) Reactions
transfer copragon from extracellular space to periplasm, and then to
cytoplasm. The maximum change (z-score) for the genes of copragon
transport via ABC system is —0.1, and the genes of copragon transport
via ton system is 0.88. Aggregate z-score for the metabolite coprogen is
assigned as 0.54. (B) When genes of copragon transport via ABC system
are considered together they return MI of 0.792, and M1 for the genes of
copragon transport via ton system is 0.808. Average turns out to be 0.8,
which is a relatively high mutual information value. Result is different
than the prediction made by RA

the range [—Infinity, 0.88) would yield the same z-score for the
reaction. Finally, the method is additive in aggregating z-scores of
each neighboring reaction to determine the z-score of a metabolite
[as shown in Equation (2)]. However, z-score ranges from nega-
tive to positive infinity, negative infinity representing the most
insigniﬁcant case. Therefore, averaging individual results intro-
duces the problem of opposite signs cancelling each other out. In
Figure 1A, copragon is assigned a z-score: ﬁ(—0.1 -I- 0.88) = 0.54.
Negative z-score (—0.1) assigned to the reaction copragon trans-
port via ABC system partially cancels out the z-score of the reac-
tion copragon transport via ton system (0.88). The problem would
have been resolved if the scoring mechanism used, assigned zero
to the most insigniﬁcant case (P = 1).

In this article, we present a new algorithm, called Mutual
Information-based Reporter Algorithm (MIRA) that addresses
the shortcomings of the original RA. MIRA is a multivariate
and combinatorial algorithm that calculates the aggregate tran-
scriptional response around a metabolite using mutual

MIRA: mutual information-based reporter algorithm for metabolic networks

 

information. Mutual Information is an information theoretic
method that measures how much knowing one variable reduces
the uncertainty about the other. In gene expression analysis, it has
been used frequently (Butte et al., 2000; Chowdhury et al., 2010;
Gupta et al., 2010; Steuer et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2010).
Chowdhury et a]. show that combinatorially dysregulated subnet—
works found through mutual information is predictive for cancer.
In metabolomics analysis, using the combinations of metabolites
and their levels, ADEMA (the algorithm for determining expected
metabolite alterations) predicts expected changes of metabolite
levels in a given metabolic network using mutual information
(Cicek et al., 2013). In the context of MIRA, the two variables
are (i) the genotype (e. g., case and control) and (ii) the combin-
ations of the genes associated with a reaction and their expression
levels. More speciﬁcally, MIRA performs the following tasks: (i)
discretize gene expression levels using B-spline functions, (ii) cal-
culate the mutual information between the genotype, as well as
combinations of genes associated in a reaction and their discre-
tized expression levels, and (iii) calculate the average mutual in-
formation for each metabolite using the mutual information of
each neighboring reaction. Figure 2 shows the overall flow of the
algorithm.
The advantages of MIRA over RA are as follows:

(1) Combinatorial mutual information works well when the
sample sizes are small, and performs better than univariate
signiﬁcance testing.

SBML

1. Extract the metaboliterreactionegene
associations from the SBMLﬁIe

 

 

2. Obtain related gene sets for each
metabolite, using neighboring reactions

 

(2) Unlike the RA, MIRA uses a multivariate method, ana-
lyzing multiple genes at a time. Therefore, it does not dis-
card less insigniﬁcant changes unlike RA. MIRA uses
measurements of individual samples instead of comparing
sample means and is able to capture linear and non-linear
dependencies among variables.

(3) Mutual information is bounded by zero and the minimum
of the entropies of the two random variables. The most
insignificant case is assigned the score zero; therefore, in-
signiﬁcant changes do not cancel out signiﬁcant changes.

(4) MIRA has no bias toward highly connected metabolites,
as it normalizes the sum of changes around a metabolite
using the number of reactions instead of the square root
of number of reactions as RA does [see Equations (2)
and (8)].

Figure 1B shows the results obtained by MIRA for the intro-
ductory example shown in Figure 1A. Unlike the RA, which
assigns a low score to the reaction copragon transport via ABC
system indicating that there is no signiﬁcant change on this
enzyme, MIRA predicts relatively high mutual information indi-
cating that when considered together genes fhuB, fhuC and fhuD
are expressed differently. MIRA predicts similar results for both
reactions and the average is found as 0.8 (max 0.98 in this test),
whereas the RA assigns 0.54 to copragon (max ~13 in this test).
The difference between the two algorithms stems from the fact
that (i) MIRA performs a multivariate analysis compared with

step, gene expression levels are discretized using B-splines. Fourth step consists of calculating the mutual information between the class variable and the
discretized expression levels of groups of genes. After each metabolite is assigned average mutual information, based on the calculations done in Step 5,
metabolites are ranked based on their average mutual information, and reporter metabolites are determined (darker red means it is a reporter metabolite)

the univariate analysis done by RA, (ii) given that there are
only seven samples (3 AarcAAfnr and 4 WT bacteria), mutual
information is able to capture the change better than z-scores
and (iii) being non-negative, mutual information does not cancel
out significant effects.

To evaluate MIRA, we have analyzed six strains of E.coli with
knockouts of transcriptional regulators in the oxygen response
(AarcA, AappY, Afnr, onyR, AsoxS and AarcAAfnr) in aerobic
and anaerobic conditions (Covert et al., 2004). We have used the
reconstructed metabolic network of E.coli (iAF1260; Feist et al.,
2007). We have also analyzed the autism gene expression dataset
(V oineagu et al., 2011) using the Recon 1 genome scale metabolic
network for humans (Duarte et al., 2007). For the E.coli dataset,
we focused on the Afnr knockout, which affects the switch be-
tween aerobic and anaerobic respiration. MIRA was able to suc-
cessfully capture metabolites that were closely related to this
enzyme and anaerobic respiration mechanism. For the autism
dataset, MIRA predicted metabolites that have been recently
discovered in the autism literature. We have also shown that
MIRA has no bias toward hub metabolites unlike RA, and scor-
ing scheme for MIRA is empirically signiﬁcant.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

This section describes suboomponents and techniques MIRA uses to
detect the hot spots in the metabolic network. Supplementary Table Sl
describes the abbreviations and notations used throughout the section.
Please see Supplementary Appendix A, Table SI, for a list of terms and
variables and their explanations.

2.1 Constructing the network

In the context of our algorithm, the network is a hyper-graph G(V,E)
where the vertex set V is the union of three entity types: metabolites, genes
and reactions. The edge set E contains two types of edges: (i) edges that
connect reactions to the associated genes whose expression lead to the
corresponding enzyme and (ii) edges that connect metabolites to asso-
ciated reactions based on producer/consumer relationships. Network in-
formation is obtained through the genome-scale reconstructed metabolic
network of the organism to be analyzed using an SBML parser.

2.2 Discretizing gene expression data

To calculate mutual information between the genotype and the gene ex-
pression observations, one needs to calculate the probability of observing
that proﬁle. This is a well-studied problem in the literature (Silverman,
1986). There are three techniques that do not assume that the values come
from a known distribution (which is the case for gene expression data).
Kernel Density Estimation aims to measure the density of observations
falling into a predetermined window using a kernel (Moon et al., 1995),
though it suffers from the high computational cost, and the results are
dependent on the kernel length. Second technique is the histogram-based
classiﬁcation, which determines thresholds by dividing the domain of the
variable into equal-sized chunks and classifying observations based on
these thresholds. Despite the low computational cost, observations that
are close to the thresholds are likely to be misclassiﬁed, as analytical
methods associate an error term with each observation (Cakmak et al.,
2012; Cicek and Ozsoyoglu, 2012). To ﬁx this shortcoming, B-spline
functions have been used to associate probabilities with each bin deter-
mined by the histogram-based approach (Cicek et al., 2013; Faith et al.,
2007). That is, each observation is associated with a probability to be in a
bin, instead of making a binary decision to determine if it is in a given bin
or not.

B-spline functions are deﬁned by parameters M and k where M is the
number of bins (chunks) that the domain is going to be divided into, and k,
1 5 k 5 M, is the number of bins an observation can be assigned to (e.g.
k = 1 is equivalent to histogram-based binning). Based on M and k,
each B-spline curve i, 1 5 i 5 M, is assigned a basis vector, the so-called
knot vector ti, deﬁned as in Equation (3), and then the curve iis deﬁned as
a function of the neighboring curves, as shown in Equations (4) and (S).

Each measurement (e.g. expression level for gene gn for person x) is as-
signed to a bin i with probability Birk(§(gn)), where §(gn) is a function that
normalizes the value of the measurement for gn using the maximum and
the minimum values observed for gn in the dataset.

2.3 Calculation of mutual information

After expression values are calculated, mutual information is calculated.
Given two random variables X and Y, mutual information I ( X; Y) meas-
ures how much knowing one reduces the uncertainty about the other.

In the context of MIRA, the ﬁrst variable is the binary class variable C
[e.g. control versus variable) and the second variable B( G( r ) ) is the
binned measurements of a group of genes G( r ) that are associated with
a reaction r. For instance, for the example shown in Figure 2B, genes
fhuE and tonB are grouped based on their association with the reaction
coprogen transport via ton system (ctts). Assuming we use 2 bins (up and
down) then, C = {WT, AarcAAfnr} and B(G(ctts) ) = {fhuE up & tonB
up, fhuE up & tonB down, fhuE down & tonB up, fhuE down & tonB down}.
I(C;B(G(ctts))) is found to be 0.808.

The goal of calculating I ( C;B( G( r ) ) ) is to learn how much knowing
discretized gene expression levels of related genes reduces the uncertainty
on the genotype. In other words, we ﬁnd out whether a reaction r and its
corresponding genes are predictive on the genotype. If the expression
levels of these genes (when considered together) are different with respect
to the class variable, then we obtain a high mutual information value.
Equation (6) speciﬁes the mutual information formula.

b , 6

KC; B(G(r») = Z,ge,,0,,»Z,ECp(bg, c) * 1g  (6)
p(bg) is calculated as shown in Equation (7) and k is a constant input to
the algorithm. That is, given a dataset D, probability of observing g (e.g.
fhuE up and tonB up) is the multiplication of spline values for each gene
(e.g. fhuE and tonB) to be in the corresponding bins (e. g. up and up in this
case), summed and averaged over all individuals in D. This calculation
assumes that gene expression values are independent of each other.
p(bg,c) is calculated similarly and p(c) is constant in the dataset.

We deﬁne the aggregate transcriptional regulation around a metabolite
m as the average mutual information of the consumer and producer reac-
tions of m. Given that R( m ) is the set of neighboring reactions,
then average mutual information Im for metabolite m is deﬁned as in
Equation (8).

MIRA ﬁts a beta distribution to Im values given the interval. Then,
Im~Beta(or, ,8) where or and ,8 are learned from the sample. Finally, all
metabolites with P<0.05 are picked as reporter metabolites.

2.4 Datasets and experimental design

To test the performance of MIRA and compare it with RA, we con-
sidered two resources. First, we used mRNA expression proﬁles of six
E.coli strains with knockouts of transcriptional regulators of the oxygen
response (AarcA, AappY, Afnr, onyR, AsoxS and AarcAAfnr) pub-
lished and released in Covert et al. (2004). For each strain they obtained
measurements in aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Consequently, we
used 12 datasets for the knockouts and 12 for the WT. We compared
the expression proﬁles of selected knockouts against the control, to
obtain reporter metabolites using each respective method. We did not
perform cross-condition comparisons. For instance, we compared knock-
out measurements under aerobic conditions with WT measurements
under aerobic conditions only. Second, we ran tests on the autism spec-
trum disorder (ASD) brain gene expression dataset (Voineagu et al.,
2011). The dataset contains gene expression levels for 8858 genes for 58
human cortex samples (29 ASD and 29 controls).

We implemented MIRA in C# language using ET Framework 4.0.
Tests were run on a Dell PowerEdge R710 Server with two Intel®
Xeon® quad processors and 48 GB main memory. The server runs on
Windows Server 2008 operating system.

For E.coli knockout tests, we used the genome scale-reconstructed
metabolic network model of E.coli, iAF1260 (Feist et al., 2007). The
model contains 1972 metabolites, 2382 reactions, 1261 genes and 3 com-
partments. We mapped the measured genes to the corresponding reac-
tions in the metabolic network, as annotated in the model. After the
mapping, we obtained 1643 metabolites, to which there was at least
one reaction associated with a gene measured in the dataset. Only the
obtained 1643 metabolites were considered in the tests. For the Autism
dataset, we used the Reconl genome-scale metabolic network for humans
(Duarte et al., 2007). The model consists of 3188 metabolites, 3742 reac-
tions, 1499 genes and 8 compartments. Mapping the genes measured to
the network resulted in a metabolite set of size 2331 for further consid-
eration. For both datasets, we used M = 6 and k = 4 to discretize meas-
urements using B-splines. Please see Supplementary Appendix B for time
requirements.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Comparing reporter metabolite sets of MIRA and RA

To compare the performances of MIRA and RA, we obtained
reporter metabolites using both algorithms. First, we investigated
how similar two sets are using the Jaccard distance (JD). JD is
complementary to the J accard index, which is the ratio of shared
items between the two sets, A and B, and the union of the items
in two sets. Jaccard index is denoted as J(A,B). JD, J3(A,B), is
equivalent to 1 — J ( A,B ). Two algorithms yield different sets of
reporter metabolites for E.coli knockouts. For the
knockouts AappY (anaerobic) and AOxyR (aerobic), the sets
of reporter metabolites are totally distinct (JD = l) and the
smallest JD obtained in these tests is 0.85. For the Autism data-
set, JD is 0.9.

3.2 Robustness against hub metabolites

Metabolic networks are known to be scale free (Albert, 2005),
that is, their degree distribution follows the power law. Our re-
sults show that the reporter metabolites found by RA are usually
highly connected metabolites known as hubs or common metab-
olites, which are rare in scale-free networks. For instance, in the
test for Afnr (aerobic), RA marks H+ , H20, ATP, ADP,
Phosphate, Diphosphate and C02 as the top 7 reporter metab-
olites, which participate in many reactions and are associated
with many genes in the metabolic network. To test if RA has a
bias toward hub metabolites, we calculated the average gene
connectivity and reaction connectivity of the reporter metabolites
for each algorithm. We also formed a random set of metabolites
where the size of the random set is randomly chosen as a number
between the sizes of reporter sets produced by MIRA and RA.
We repeated the random set selection 10 000 times and found the
average connectivity for the random set. Figure 3A shows the
average gene connectivity, and Figure 3B shows the average re-
action connectivity of the reporter metabolites for MIRA, RA
and the random set for E.coli knockout tests. Results show that
RA favors highly connected metabolites, whereas reporter me-
tabolites found by MIRA have a closer degree distribution to the
random set, and does not have such a bias. This also applies to
reporter metabolites found in the Autism dataset by RA
(Supplementary Table S5). The intuitive reason for this differ-
ence is that MIRA averages the mutual information found for
each reaction, whereas RA divides the sum by the square root of
the number of reactions around a metabolite.

3.3 Interpreting reporter metabolites for Afnr
(anaerobic) dataset

When E.coli has no 02 as the final electron acceptor, it switches
to anaerobic respiration and uses electron donating dehydrogen-
ases and accepting reductases on the membrane. Fumarate
Nitrate Reductase (fnr) is a transcriptional regulator that regu-
lates 100+ genes and nitrate/fumarate reduction in response to
the switch from aerobic to anaerobic respiration in E.coli. Fnr
has an iron-sulfur cluster [4Fe4lS] that senses the presence of
oxygen and becomes inactivated when oxidized in the presence
of oxygen. It can also be converted into a disulﬁde form by
glutathione or thioredoxin when inactive (Daruwala and
Meganathan, 1991).

Figure 4 shows a simplified depiction of the dynamics in
anaerobic respiration with respect to fnr (Keseler et al., 2013;
MetaCyc; Unden and Bongaerts, 1997; UniProt). Although
there are many types of dehydrogenases and reductases, we
draw them in two groups for the sake of simplicity: (i) hydrophilic
side toward periplasm and (ii) hydrophilic side toward cytoplasm.
Electron donors like G3P, formate, lactate, NADH, H2 are oxi-
dized by the hydrogenases, and electrons are transported using
menaquinone to the reductases. Focusing on nitrate reductase,
this electron is transferred to protoheme, then to Fe-S cluster
and, ﬁnally, to molybdenum (Mo). It is used to reduce nitrate
to nitrite. Fnr stimulates the expression of this enzyme. In the
presence of 02, fnr is oxidized and inactivated. As stated above,
glutathione and thioredoxin act as electron donors to activate fnr.

tabolites found by MIRA and Table S3 lists reporter metabolites

Fig. 3. Application of Average gene and reaction connectivity of the reporter metabolites. Panel (A) shows average number of genes associated with the
reporter metabolites found by RA and MIRA in E.coli knockout tests. Random set reports the average number of genes connected randomly chosen
metabolites of the same size as the original sets (repeated 10000 times and averaged). Panel (B) shows the same results for the average number of

reactions associated with metabolites

found by RA based on Afnr knockout under anaerobic condi-
tion. Previous description is based on the data obtained from
UniProt Database, which summarizes the key concepts and me-
tabolites related to fnr. The metabolites reported by MIRA
highly overlap with this deﬁnition. The second reporter metab-
olite protoheme (heme b) is an important metabolite in the heme-
biosynthesis pathway, and is the first electron acceptor in nitrate
reductase complex (Metacyc). As mentioned above, glutathione
and thioredoxin are key agents to convert the enzyme, and
MIRA detects them as reporter metabolites [glutaredoxin
(reduced/oxidized) and thioredoxin (reduced/oxidized)]. Nitrite
is one of the direct products of nitrate reductase, and it is also
reported as a reporter metabolite.

Aside from the metabolites in UniProt’s definition, MIRA
found dimethyl sulﬁde/sulfoxide (DMSO) and trimethylamine/
trimethylamine n-oxide (TMAO) as reporter metabolites. As
Figure 4 shows, E.coli uses N— and S— oxides as the terminal
electron acceptors (Daruwala and Meganathan, 1991).

When RA is considered, the top metabolite picked by MIRA
is not a reporter metabolite in RA’s list. Tungstate is known as a
direct inhibitor of nitrate reductase as well as TMAO and
DMSO reductases, which are also reporter metabolites (Prins
et al., 1980). Similarly, tripeptide murein units [short name for
two linked disacharide tripeptide murein units (uncrosslinked
middle of chain )] is also not picked by RA and might seem un-
related at ﬁrst. Murein units constitute bacterial cell walls.
Membrane-bound lytic murein transglycosylase is the enzyme
that degrades mureins, and the gene responsible to transcribe
this enzyme is dniR (mltD). A mutant of this enzyme is known
to be defective in producing nitrite reductase. Nitrate and nitrite
also stimulate the expression of dniR (Kajie et al., 1991).

Most striking difference in the reporter metabolites found by
RA is that the first seven metabolites are H-I-, H20, ADP, P,
ATP, NAD, NADH (NADP, NADPH, 02, CDP, UDP, dADP,
dCDP, GDP, GTP, CoA are also listed). These are highly

connected metabolites, which take place in many biochemical
activities in the cell, and therefore, it is hard to link them to
the effect of the knockout in this test. MIRA puts these metab-
olites within (695964] in the ranking of 1643 metabolites con-
sidered. Also RA lists many metabolites from the central
metabolism: Glycerophosphoglycerol, pyruvate, glycerol, F6P,
succinate d-glucose and acetyl-CoA. Similarly, these metabolites
can be considered as general owing to the diverse functionality of
the pathway they are in. Having that said, RA detects some
metabolites that are not picked by MIRA and are relevant.
For instance, sulfate and molybdate are incorporated into fnr
and nitrate reductase (Tavares et al., 2006). Menaquinone 8,
menaquinol 8 and 2-demethylmenaquinol 8, link dehydrogenases
and reductases/oxidases in the electron transport chains, and
hence are directly related to fnr enzyme as shown in Figure 4
(Unden and Bongaerts, 1997). Although ubiquinone-8/ubiqui—
nol—8 play an important role in aerobic respiration, they are
listed higher than menaquinone 8/menaquinol 8.

In conclusion, the results suggest that (i) MIRA has no bias
toward hub metabolites, and successfully downplays their im-
portance, and (ii) MIRA yields reporter metabolites, which are
in close proximity to the enzyme and are relevant with respect to
the literature.

3.4 Interpreting reporter metabolites for the
autism dataset

ASD is a developmental genetic disorder that causes social inter-
action abnormalities, communication deficiencies and repetitive
behavior. Although the disease has a genetic origin, metabolic
implications have been studied widely in the literature (Boccuto
et al., 2013; Emond et al., 2013; Yap et al., 2010). Running
MIRA on the gene expression dataset provided by Voineagu
et al., 2011, has resulted in 52 reporter metabolites as shown in
Supplementary Appendix C, Table S4. Reporter metabolites
found by RA is listed in Supplementary Appendix C, Table S5.

Fig. 4. Anaerobic respiration of E.coli with respect to fnr and reporter metabolites found by MIRA. Anaerobic respiration of E.coli couples electron
donors to electron acceptors via dehydrogenases and reductases on the inner membrane. There are many types of dehydrogenases and reductases;
however, only two types are shown: hydrophilic side toward cytosol and toward periplasm. Sizes and shapes of the proteins are not drawn to scale. Only
nitrate reductase is shown in more detail and separately. Forrnate, lactate, NADH, H2 G3P are electron donors and lead to reduction of acceptors like
nitrate, nitrite, DMSO, TMSO and fumarate. Menanquinone acts as a mediator between dehydrogenases and reductases. In the case of nitrate reductase,
electron is transferred through protoheme, Fe-S cluster and Molybdenum to reduce nitrate to nitrate. Fnr activates this enzyme, and tungstate is a well-
known inhibitor. Fnr is inactivated by oxygen and can be reactivated by agents like glutaredoxin and thioredoxin. Murein units constitute the cell wall,
and the enzyme that degrades murein units is transcribed by dniR gene. It is known that dniR regulates nitrite reductase and it is stimulated but nitrite

and nitrite

The ﬁrst and the eighth metabolites located as reporter by
MIRA are protein-linked serine/threonine residue and protein-
linked asparagine residue at glycosylation sites. Glycosylation
is a process that attaches glycans to proteins as a post-trans-
lational modiﬁcation in the secretion pathway. Secretion path-
way is known as an important factor in brain development,
and DIAlR mutation leads to ASD and mental retardation
(Aziz et al., 2011). More specifically, it is reported in the
literature that 7 glycosylation-related genes are affected by
copy number variations (CNVs) in autism patients (van der
Zwaag et al., 2009; Pinto et al., 2010). We also observe
glycans such as glycophosphatidylinositol later in the reporter
list.

Glucuronidation is an important process for detoxiﬁcation of
most xenobiotics by making such components more water-
soluble and less toxic by attaching glucuronate to the substrates
(Stein et al., 2011). The second metabolite d-glucorate and the
third metabolite d-glucurono—6,3-lactone (d—glucurone), located

by MIRA, are direct precursors of glucuronate. Stein et al.
(2011) reports evidence on lower glucuronidation levels in chil-
dren ASD, which may explain d-glucurono-6,3-lactone being a
stress point in the metabolic network. L-Arabinose is also in this
pathway and is located as a reporter by MIRA.

Histone n6-methyl-l-lysine, protein n6,n6-dimethyl-l-lysine,
peptdyl-l-lysine and protein n6,n6,n6-trimethyl-l-lysine, all
located by MIRA, belong to lysine degradation pathway.
These metabolites are centered on the path that consumes
lysine and produces carnitine. Celestino-Soper et al. have
revealed that dysregulation of carnitine metabolism may be im-
portant in non-dysmorphic autism. The results show that a de-
letion in TMLHE gene on this pathway has a signiﬁcant
correlation with ASD (Celestino-Soper et al., 2012). In a recent
work, Frye et al. (2013) links the abnormalities in acyl-camitine
levels and autism.

Lipoylprotein, lipoamide, dihydrolipolprotein and dihydroli-
poamide, all located by MIRA, are four metabolites that are in

Fig. 5. Empirical testing of the signiﬁcance of the scoring schemes. Panel (A) shows series of z-scores obtained for each random set, and for the original
dataset (shown as the red line with large circles) by RA. Scores are sorted in descending order. Panel (B) shows the [ms for the same data obtained by
MIRA. Panels (C) and (D) show close-ups for the ﬁrst 50 metabolites for Panels (A) and (B), respectively

the glycine cleavage pathway. MIRA reports four metabolites
out of six in this pathway and points to an alteration in
this process. A recent work by Yu et al. (2013) conﬁrms that a
mutation in AMT gene is also associated with ASD. This muta-
tion leads to a deﬁciency in glycine cleavage system. In addition
to this, the metabolic proﬁling done by Yap et al. (2010) shows
signiﬁcant differences in glycine levels in the urine of autistic
children.

Starting with stearidonyl coenzyme A, MIRA detects 17 inter-
mediates of fatty acid synthesis pathway as reporter metabolites.
Fatty acid metabolism and autism have been associated in the
literature. Richardson and Ross point to the growing evidence
on the relation between neurodegenerative diseases and fatty acid
abnormalities (Richardson and Ross, 2000). Among more recent
works, Tamiji and Crawford state that children with autism
show higher rates of lipid metabolism than controls (Tamiji
and Crawford, 2010). El-Ansary et al. (2011) report increase in
most of the saturated fatty acids in a cohort of 52 autism
patients.

In comparison, none of the aforementioned reporter metabol-
ites are located by RA, but common metabolites are highly
ranked as in E.coli tests.

In summary, reporter metabolites picked by MIRA for autism
are backed by literature. Results show that, although some pre-
dictions (e. g. glycine cleavage deﬁciency) are not obvious targets,
the MIRA method was able to predict them. The literature on
the relation between autism and (i) glucuronation (Stein et al.,
2011), (ii) lysine degradation and carnitine metabolism
(Celestino-Soper et al., 2012; Frye et al., 2013) and (iii) glycine
cleavage H u et al., 2013) did not exist at the time of the gene
expression dataset was published. Hence, MIRA shows promis-
ing prospect for discovering new metabolic targets.

3.5 Empirically testing the signiﬁcance of scoring
schemes used by MIRA and RA

To assess the significance of the scores calculated by both algo-
rithms and assess the reliability of the rankings, we used an

empirical signiﬁcance testing using the following method. We
(i) shuffled the labels of the individuals in the autism dataset
100 times to obtain 100 random datasets, (ii) ran MIRA and
RA on these datasets, as well as on the original data, and (iii)
sorted and plotted the scores in descending order for all 101
instances. Figure 5A shows the scores for RA, and Figure 5B
shows the results for MIRA. Big red circles represent the results
found on the original dataset. Figures 5C and 5D show a close-
up for the first 50 metabolites in the ranking. MIRA’s results for
the original dataset dominate the random curves and, hence,
suggest an empirically signiﬁcant result. On the other hand,
RA’s output for original data follows a similar pattern with
the random datasets.

4 CONCLUSION

Metabolic networks have received signiﬁcant attention in the
past decade. This advancement has led to the investigation of
various genetic diseases and their metabolism with the use of the
reconstructed genome scale metabolic networks. One application
is to find the regulatory architecture of the metabolic network
using the underlying transcriptome. The RA finds the metabolic
hot spots around which transcriptional regulation is centered. In
this article, we developed a novel method, called MIRA, that
uses a combinatorial approach and mutual information to find
reporter metabolites. Our approach addresses the shortcomings
of the existing RA algorithm. More specifically, it is robust
against small sample sizes, uses a multivariate approach instead
of a univariate one and does not cancel out signiﬁcant changes in
expression levels with non-significant ones. Our results show that
(i) MIRA has no bias on picking hub metabolites as reporter
metabolites, (ii) reporter metabolites found by MIRA are bio-
logically sound and are supported by literature even for a com-
plex disease like Autism, (iii) MIRA captures the effects of a
knockout of the Fnr gene in E.coli successfully and (iv) MIRA
provides empirically signiﬁcant results, which supports the fact
that it captures the underlying biological phenomenon.

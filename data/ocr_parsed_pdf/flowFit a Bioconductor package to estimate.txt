ABSTRACT

Summary: Herein we introduce flowFit, a Bioconductor package de-
signed to perform quantitative analysis of cell proliferation in tracking
dye-based experiments. The software, distributed as an R
Bioconductor library, is based on a mathematical model that takes
into account the height of each peak, the size and position of the
parental population (labeled but not proliferating) and the estimated
distance between the brightness of a cell and the brightness of its
daughter (in which the dye is assumed to undergo a 2-fold dilution).
Although the algorithm does not make any inference on cell types,
rates of cell divisions or rates of cell death, it deconvolutes the
actual collected data into a set of peaks, whereby each peak corres-
ponds to a subpopulation of cells that have divided N times. We
validated flowFit by retrospective analysis of published proliferation-
tracking experiments and demonstrated that the algorithm predicts
the same percentage of cells/generation either in samples with dis-
cernible peaks (in which the peaks are visible in the collected raw data)
or in samples with non-discernible peaks (in which the peaks are fused
together). To the best of our knowledge, flowFit represents the first
open-source algorithm in its category and might be applied to numer-
ous areas of cell biology in which quantitative deconvolution of track-
ing dye-based experiments is desired, including stem cell research.

1 INTRODUCTION

In cell proliferation-tracking experiments, cells are stainedi
before being cultured under various conditionsiwith a ﬂuores-
cent dye to follow proliferation kinetics. At each mitosis, the dye
is roughly equally divided between daughter cells, so that each
daughter is about half as ﬂuorescent as the mother. At any given
moment, therefore, the ﬂuorescence intensity of a cell bears wit-
ness to its divisional history when compared with the intensity of
the parental population.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

In a typical experimental pipeline, cells are ﬁrst labeled with a
tracking dye, then allowed to proliferate (frequently in the pres-
ence of speciﬁc stimuli) and ﬁnally analyzed by ﬂow cytometry
by collecting data for (i) unlabeled cells (used as a negative con-
trol), (ii) unstimulated labeled cells (the non-proliferating popu-
lation) and (iii) sample(s) of labeled and stimulated cells (the
proliferating populations). If the characteristics of the logarith-
mic amplifier on the ﬂow cytometer are known, it is possible to
derive, from a histogram of ﬂuorescence intensity, the proportion
of cells that have undergone any particular number of divisions
(Givan et al., 1999; 2004). Generally, a ﬂow cytometer with 1024
channels (channels range) represents a nominal range of 4 log
decades.

Several ﬂuorochromes have been used to track cell prolifer-
ation (Parish, 1999), including DNA-binding ﬂuorescent
dyes (Hoechst 33342, thiazole orange), cytoplasmically
distributed ﬂuorescent dyes (calcein, 2’,7’-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)—
5(6)—carboxyﬂuorescein), covalent coupling ﬂuorescent dyes
(Carboxyﬂuorescein succinimidyl ester, ﬂuorescein isothiocyan-
ate) and membrane-inserting ﬂuorescent dyes (PKH26, Celque
Lavander). Although each dye displays advantages and disad-
vantages for individual experimental purposes [reviewed in
(Parish, 1999)], a common problem is represented by the quan-
tiﬁcation of the ﬂuorescence signal: under optimal conditions
some dyes [e.g. carboxyﬂuorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester
(CFSE)] form separate peaks deﬁning different proliferative gen-
erations, whereas others (e.g. PKH26) do not (Givan et al.,
2004). A good proliferation-tracking algorithm should be able
to give similar results in both cases.

Here we introduce ﬂowFit, an R (R Development Core Team,
2012) Bioconductor library (Gentleman et al., 2004) that ﬁts a set
of peaks (corresponding to different generations of cells) to the
histogram of ﬂuorescence intensity acquired during a ﬂuores-
cence-activated cell sorting (FACS) experiment. The package is
integrated with the Bioconductor libraries used for the analysis
of ﬂow cytometry datasets: ﬂowCore (Hahne et al., 2009) and
ﬂowViz (Sarkar et al., 2008). The performance of ﬂowFit was
evaluated by the retrospective analysis of a published dataset of
dye-tracking experiments (Quah and Parish, 2012), in which
lymphocytes were stained with three different proliferation-
tracking dyes: CFSE, cell proliferation dye eFluor 670 (CPD)
and CellTrace Violet (CTV). In particular, we meta-analyzed a
subpopulation of CD4+ lymphocytes labeled with the three dif-
ferent staining reagents. The three samples were allowed to pro-
liferate under identical growth conditions; however, differences
in the characteristics of the dyes yielded rather different

ﬂuorescence histograms with different peak definitions (Quah
and Parish, 2012). FlowFit was able to deconvolute equally
well in all situations and to estimate the same percentage of
cells per generation under all conditions.

2 METHODS

2.1 Model

The proliferation-ﬁtting algorithm uses an R implementation of the
LevenbergiMarquardt algorithm (Elzhov et al., 2012) to ﬁt a set of N
peaks to the histogram of the ﬂuorescence intensity from the acquired
ﬂow cytometry data ﬁle (FCS ﬁle). The LevenbergiMarquardt algorithm
provides a numerical solution to the problem of minimizing a function
over a space of parameters. It is an iterative technique that locates the
minimum of a multivariate function. The ‘minimum’ is expressed as the
sum of the squares of non-linear real-valued functions (Levenberg, 1944).
The algorithm adjusts the function parameters to reduce the sum of
squares (residuals) between the real data and the model. When the current
solution is far from the initial guess of parameters, the algorithm behaves
as a steepest descendent method. When the current solution is close to the
correct solution, it becomes a GaussiNewton method (Bjorck, 1996). The
proliferation-ﬁtting algorithm ﬁts an initial single peak on the parental
population (cells labeled and unstimulated), according to this formula:
2 (x — “)2
a e—2S2 (l)
where a2 is proportional to the height of the peak, )1. is the peak position
on the FACS scale and sis proportional to the peak size (for the parental
population, it corresponds to the variance in the initial staining). The
formula for the next peak (corresponding to the cells that have divided
once) will be:
2 (x — (u — 0))2
b e 2S2 (2)
where b2 is proportional to the height of the peak, and D is the distance
between two generations of cells.

The distance between two cell generations is deﬁned as the distance
between a mother cell and its progeny (that contains half of the amount
of dye present in the mother). This distance is constant on a logarithmic
scale and depends on the number of data points analyzed by the FACS
instrument and on the range of log decades.

It is possible to convert the FACS ﬂuorescence intensity (FFI) re-
corded by the instrument into the relative ﬂuorescence intensity (RFI)
expressed in molecules of equivalent ﬂuorochrome (Spherotech, 2012)
using the following formula:

FFM

 

RF] 2 10 c (3)
The inverse formula can be used to convert RFI to FFI:
c*log(RFI)
FF] 2 — 4
(l*log(10)) ( )

where:

(1) RFI is the relative ﬂuorescent intensity
(2) FFI is the ﬂuorescence intensity on the FACS scale
(3) l is the number of log decades in the FACS instrument

(4) c is the number of data points (channels) in the instrument

Using these formulas, it is possible to estimate the spacing between
generations of cells on the FACS instrument scale: we first convert the
peak position of the parental population (unstimulated population) into
RFI, then we calculate the RFI of the ﬁrst-generation cells (RFI/2) and,
ﬁnally, we convert back the RFI into FFI; the difference between FFI of
the parental population and FFI of the ﬁrst generation of cells represents

the distance between generations (D). In the ﬂowFit library, this spacing
is automatically computed with the function generationsDzlrtance. The
number of log decades on the instrument can be estimated by converting
the linear scale of the detector into a log scale:

I = log(R) (5)

where R is the acquisition resolution (data range for the detector).

The proliferationFitting and parentFitting functions automatically com-
pute the log decades from the keywords in the PCS ﬁle or using the
logarithm of R[log(R)]. If the functions ﬁnd a ‘log decades’ keyword
for the current detector in the PCS ﬁle, they use the value in the keyword;
otherwise, log decades are estimated from the detector acquisition
resolution.

The algorithm automatically computes the number of peaks to be
ﬁtted on the proliferating population using the data range for the de-
tector: ﬁrst, the distance between two generations of cells is estimated
using the generationsDistance function; then the maximum number of
peaks that can be ﬁtted on the FACS instrument scale is estimated
with the following formula:

D
N:—
C

(6)
where:

(1) N is the number of peaks to ﬁt on the dataset
(2) D is the distance between two generations of cells

(3) c is the number of data points (channels) in the instrument
The formula for a model with three peaks will be:

_ 2 _ _ 2 _ _2 2
Mzaze(X2S2M) Wee (1222 0» +6260: (22 D» (7)

 

where the parameters a, b and c are proportional to the height of the
peaks.

In the ‘ﬁxed model’ (options ﬁxedModelzTRUE), the Levenbergi
Marquardt algorithm estimates the height of each peak but allows the
user to keep one or more of these variables constant: parental peak pos-
ition ()t), parental peak size (s) and the distance between two generations
(D); the variables added to the list of ﬁxedPars will be kept constant
during the algorithm iterations. In the ‘dynamic model’ (options
ﬁxedModel = FALSE), the LevenbergiMarquardt algorithm uses as par-
ameters all the variables in the model. In general terms, the dynamic
model best suits the analysis of samples showing discernible peaks.
Conversely, when the sample features poorly deﬁned or no discernible
peaks and the model is unable to accommodate the peaks, it is preferable
to keep those variables ﬁxed.

Once the height of each peak is estimated, it can be used to estimate the
number of cells per generation through a numerical integration of (7):

1.”: WM (8)

where v and W are the lower and upper limits of the FACS instrument
scale, respectively. For each generation, the number of cells in the peak
can be computed through another numerical integration:

w 2 (X-(M -(i-1)D))2
I,- = j; (h,— eT (9)
and the percentage of cells in a peak can be estimated as:
If
Pg, 2 I— >i< 100 (10)
all

To evaluate the proliferation in the sample, ﬂowFit uses the
proliferationlndex function: the proliferation index is calculated as the
sum of the cells in all generationsiincluding the parentalidivided by

the computed number of original parental cells theoretically present at the
beginning of the experiment (Munson, 2010). The proliferation index is a

2.2 Implementation

The ﬂowFit is distributed in the R software language (R Development
Core Team, 2012) as a Bioconductor (Gentleman et al., 2004) package.
The package is freely available and distributed under the Artistic 2.0
License (Open Source Initiative, 2013). The ﬂowFit package is composed
of two main functions (parentFitting and proly’erationFitting) and ﬁve
secondary functions (logTicks, proliferationlndex, generationsDzlrtance,
proliferationGrid and getGenerations).

The typical pipeline involves a ﬁrst step (Fig. 1a) where the FACS raw
data are imported, transformed and gated with the ﬂowCore library
(Hahne et al., 2009). By applying the function parentFitting to the
sample representing the parental population, the position and size of
the ﬁrst peak are then established (Fig. 1b). Finally, the estimated par-
ental peak position and size are used to perform a ﬁt on the proliferating
population with the function proliferationFitting (Fig. 1c). The position
and size of the parental population can be used as an initial guess for the
LevenbergeMarquardt algorithm (dynamic model); in this case, the algo-
rithm will adjust these variables, in the proliferating population, as
needed to achieve optimal ﬁtting. Alternatively, position and size of the
parental population can be used as constants (ﬁxed model). In general,
when the input data have poorly deﬁned cell division peaks, the ﬁxed
model is preferable.

Because tracking dyes are partitioned roughly equally between daugh-
ter cells, it is possible to assume that the size of cell division peaks in the
data is mainly due to the variance in the initial staining. For this reason,

 

the proliferation-ﬁtting algorithm uses the width of the parental peak to
calculate the size of each peak in the ﬁnal population [s in Equation (7)].

FlowFit depends on ﬂowCore, a Bioconductor package that provides
data structures and basic functions to deal with FCS data. The user
will load the data and gate them with the ﬂowCore functions to select
the correct population and to remove aggregates and debris. After
these preprocessing steps, the user will use the ﬂowFit library to perform
the proliferation ﬁtting. The algorithm is not able to detect ploidy
patterns.

3 RESULTS

The proliferation-ﬁtting algorithm was tested by retrospective
analysis of a published dataset consisting of three samples of
mouse lymphocytes stained with CFSE, CTV and CPD (Quah
and Parish, 2012). We focused on the raw data used to generate
Figure 2a of the original paper. This subset of raw data contains
four samples:

(1) CD4+ non-stimulated lymphocytes labeled with CFSE,
CPD and CTV (parental population)

(2) CD4+ lymphocytes labeled with CFSE and stimulated

The datasets, already gated for CD4+ lymphocytes, were
log10 transformed after truncation at 1. Then, we performed
three parentFitting on the ‘parental sample’ to establish the
position and size of the parental population for the three dyes
(Fig. 2a). Using the parental peak position and size as a best
guess, we performed a praliferatianFitting with the dynamic
model on the CFSE and CTV samples. In the CPD sample,
the stimulated population did not display well-separated peaks,
at variance with the CTV and CFSE samples. Thus, for the CPD
sample, we used a ﬁxed model (praliferatianFitting with
ﬁxedModel=TRUE), keeping the parental peak position ﬁxed
(Fig. 2b and c). Finally, we compared the percentage of cells per
generation in the three samples and evaluated the concordance
among the ﬁttings. Using the chi-squared test, we did not observe
any significant difference in the distribution of cells per gener-
ation among the three estimates (p: 1), arguing that the algo-
rithm is correctly estimating the percentage of cells per
generation in the three samples (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Altogether, the praliferatianFitting analysis performed on the
datasets published by Quah and Parish, which yielded similar
results compared with those of the original study, argues for
the suitability of ﬂowFit to the analysis of cell proliferation in
tracking dye experiments with either poorly or well-discemible
peaks, based on the dual possibility to ﬁt them, respectively, with
the dynamic model or with the ﬁxed model.

We also performed an in silica analysis to benchmark the per-
formance of the algorithm with random samples (Table 1 and
Supplementary Materials Section 3, including Supplementary
Figs. S74S21) for the dynamic and fixed models. In general,
the dynamic model performed well with samples where the par-
ental peak size (that corresponds to the variance in the initial
staining) is small and the proliferating population forms well-
separated peaks. The ﬁxed model, on the other hand, performs
well also with samples with a poorly deﬁned cell division peaks
(cf: Supplementary Figs. S8 and S14).

4 DISCUSSION

The objective of this work was to provide an open-source algo-
rithm to quantify the proliferation of cells in tracking dye experi-
ments. Of note, although the proliferation-ﬁtting algorithms
currently available for this type of analyses (ModFit LTTM,

Note: Summary of in silico analysis: random samples with different levels of division
peak quality (Supplementary Section 2.1). The maximum peak width that gives
reliable results (Column: varying peak size, 017) correspond to a parent population
with 75% of the events distributed across 25.7 channels (in a FACS with 1024
channels and 4 log decades), a ‘peak size’ of 0.4 corresponds to a parent population
peak with 75% of the events distributed across 61.7 channels (in a FACS with 1024
channels and 4 log decades); random samples with different distribution of cells per
generation (Supplementary Section 2.2): the percentage of samples that gives reliable
results is depicted (Column: random samples).

FCS Express and FlowJO) are commercial software, ﬂowFit is
already publicly available and published with the Artistic 2.0
License in the Bioconductor R framework. We provided statis-
tical demonstration of the quality of the ﬁtting with both in silica
analysis and real dataset analysis. In particular, we demonstrated
the intrinsic versatility of ﬂowFit in providing reliable results in
the analysis of samples with both discernible and non-discernible
peaks. At variance with ModFit LTTM, which uses a statistical
analysis of the ﬂuorescence histogram to identify potential peaks
and a Gaussian model for the single peak, ﬂowFit uses a
LevenbergMarquadt algorithm to minimize the difference be-
tween the observed data and the model, and uses a non-Gaussian
formula (1) to deﬁne a peak. In addition, ﬂowFit is fully inte-
grated in the Bioconductor R framework.

In recent years, several approaches, based on dye tracking,
have been developed to identify and isolate adult stem cells
(SCs) from normal and tumor tissues (e.g. Cicalese et al., 2009;
Pece et al., 2010). These methodologies rely on the fact thatiin
the normal adult SC compartmentiSCs divide asymmetrically
to generate two daughter cells with opposite proliferative and
differentiative fates: one of the two daughter cells retains the
SC fate and withdraws into quiescence, whereas the other be-
comes a progenitor and enters a tumultuous phase of repeated
symmetric divisions, required to expand the progenitor compart-
ment, followed by terminal lineage differentiation. One charac-
teristic of the SC compartment in cancer is that the cancer SCs
tend to skip rounds of asymmetric division, in favor of symmet-
ric divisions, after which both daughters divide again (Morrison
and Kimble, 2006). This leads to an expansion of the SC com-
partment. The ‘rate of skipping’ seems to be higher in poorly
differentiated more aggressive tumors (Cicalese et al., 2009; Pece
et al., 2010). Methodologies to follow the kinetics of SC division
in vitra and to compare the rate of symmetric versus asymmetric
divisions are needed if we want to understand the biological
bases of homeostasis of normal SC compartments and of how
expansion of the SC compartment drives cancer growth and
aggressiveness. We envision this as one of the major areas of
application for ﬂowFit. To this aim, the integration of ﬂowFit
with a stochastic model of cell proliferation based on a Gillespie
algorithm will likely be required to analyze in real tumor tissues
the proliferation kinetics of cancer SCs compared with that of
their tumor progeny, and to compare proliferation data from
these populations with relevant theoretical models of prolifer-
ation (for instance, models of asymmetric versus symmetric
mode of division in the cancer SC versus the transient-amplifying
compartment of progenitors). This approach will probably be
instrumental to identifying parameters in the stochastic model
able to yield the best overlap between real data and simulations.

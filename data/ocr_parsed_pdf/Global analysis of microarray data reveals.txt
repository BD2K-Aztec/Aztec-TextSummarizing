ABSTRACT

Motivation: It is expected that individual genes have intrinsically
different variability in the global expressional trend among them.
Thus, the consideration of gene-specific expressional properties
will help us to distinguish target-selective gene expression over
non-selective over-expression.

Results: The re-standardization and integration of heterogeneous
microarray datasets, available from public databases, have enabled
us to determine the global expression properties of individual genes
across a wide variety of experimental conditions and samples.
The global averages and SDs of expression for each gene in
the integrated microarray datasets were found to be intrinsic
properties, which were consistent among independent collections
of datasets using different microarray platforms. Using the gene-
specific intrinsic parameters to rescale the microarray data, we
were able to distinguish novel selective gene expression [cartilage
oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) and Collagen X] in breast cancer
tissues from non-selective over-expression, a difference that has not
been detectable by conventional methods.

1 INTRODUCTION

DNA microarray experiments have provided a powerful tool for
monitoring transcriptome-wide changes in gene expression that
are associated with physiological or pathological states (Su et al.,
2001). Large-scale microarray experiments can serve as a resource
for a systematic understanding of global expression trends in
the transcriptome under various experimental conditions or in
different tissues. With the recent rapid increase in microarray
expression datasets available in public databases, it has become
possible to virtually monitor the global expression trends of a
gene in diverse biological samples under various conditions. The
availability of a large collection of microarray data in the NCBI
(National Center for Biotechnology Information) Gene Expression

Omnibus (GEO, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo; Barrett et al.,
2005, 2007) provides a resource for the physiome-wide analysis
of gene expression on a genome scale. However, the microarray
datasets available in public domains have been contributed by
many different research groups using a variety of experimental
and data-normalization methods. The effects of normalization
strategies have been extensively evaluated elsewhere (Shippy et al.,
2006). For example, two different transformations of the same
data may produce two differential expression of gene (DEG)
lists with only ~30% agreement (Gagarin et al., 2005). Thus,
the heterogeneity among groups of microarray datasets requires
additional standardization of individual microarray samples before
integrative analysis. To this end, we have attempted to rescale and
integrate heterogeneous microarray datasets from the NCBI GEO
by using a two-step gene-oriented standardization procedure, gene-
speciﬁc large scale analysis of gene expression (GS-LAGE; Yoon
et al., 2006). The analysis of the resulting integrated dataset provides
insights into gene-speciﬁc global expression trends found in various
microarray samples. These trends were then used to improve the
statistical conﬁdence of the marginal changes in gene expression
between experiments (Yoon et al., 2006).

A major challenge in microarray experiments has been the
identiﬁcation of genes whose expression is signiﬁcantly different
between samples (Aittokallio et al., 2003). Many sophisticated
statistical methods have been developed in attempts to achieve
more reliable identiﬁcation of differentially regulated genes (Huber
et al., 2002; Irizarry et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2001, 2002).
However, under many experimental conditions, the changes in
gene expression are often moderate, as compared to the array-wide
variability in expression, resulting in modest P-values that prevent
conventional statistical models from identifying real changes in
expression (Mootha et al., 2003). In fact, all existing measures
of DEG from microarray ﬂuorescence signals are optimized to
have a linear correlation with the change in mRNA levels (Cope
et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2002). Given that individual genes have
unique expression levels and ﬂuctuations (necessitated by their
biological ﬁmctions), a metric for the direct comparison of the
changes in mRNA expression between experiments cannot provide
a relevant biological interpretation based only on the signiﬁcance of
the observed DEGs between genes.

One gene may have an intrinsically large variation in expression
in different biological samples or under different conditions, while
another gene may require only small variations for its biological
function. Thus, it is reasonable that the observed DEG (i.e. mRNA

change) between experiments should be differentially interpreted
among genes, based on their speciﬁc expression behavior. Our
focus has been to better understand the biological relevance of
detected DEGs, rather than improving the ﬂuorescence intensity
normalization, which has been the focus of many existing methods
(Yoon et al., 2006). Through the creation of a database-wide
expression proﬁle for individual genes (i.e. probesets), which
provides an estimation of the gene-speciﬁc distribution of
expression levels under various experimental conditions, it is
possible to rescale individual gene expression intensities from a
speciﬁc assay by using the unique database-wide average expression
and stande deviation (SD) values for each gene. This consideration
of a gene’s behavior under a wide variety of biological conditions
provides a tool for interpreting DEGs among samples and allows
for the prioritization of genes that are differentially expressed in
speciﬁc samples. In this study, we re-standardized and integrated
a recent update of human microarray datasets obtained from the
NCBI GEO in order to analyze the global expression trends of
individual genes in the human transcriptome. We then attempted to
quantitatively determine two gene-speciﬁc expressional properties,
global average expression and SD, to systematically understand
the diversity of the intrinsic expression behaviors among genes.
Using these gene-speciﬁc properties of global expression trends
as rescaling parameters, we attempted to re-evaluate the observed
gene expression data from various human samples. Using the
gene-speciﬁc interpretation of observed DEGs, it is possible to
distinguish tissue-selective over-expression from non-selective
over-expression among genes. In this study, we applied this method
to the identiﬁcation of novel breast cancer-selective gene expression
and conﬁrmed these ﬁndings with quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) on various human tissues.

2 METHODS

2.1 Integration of microarray datasets

To construct two independent integrations of large-scale heterogeneous
microarray datasets, datasets sharing the same platforms were obtained from
the NCBI GEO ftp site. Each collection consisted of microarray sample
arrays created using Aﬂymem’x HG-UI33A Array chips (NCBI GEO ID:
GPL96) andAﬁ‘j/metrix U133 Plus 2.0 Array chips (NCBI GEO ID: GPL570).
Each array sample was assigned a unique and stable GEO accession number
(e.g. GSM), and array samples were assembled by GEO curators to form
GEO DataSet records (e.g. GDS), based on the original submitter-supplied
information summarizing each experiment. In this study, 5018 GSMS from
236 GDSs using the GPL96 platform and 1303 GSMS from 70 GDSs using
the GPL57O platform were used to construct two independent datasets. To
further validate the intrinsic properties of gene expression between different
platforms, the datasets ofIllumina Sentrix HumanRef—8 Expression BeadChip
(NCBI GEO ID: GPL2700) were also obtained and processed.

For the integration, the individual sample arrays from the GEO were ﬁrst
z-transformed by using the average expression value and SD in each sample
array (Yoon at al., 2006). To minimize the characteristics of heterogeneity
within each collection of microarray datasets caused by systematic bias
in various experimental conditions, we applied the quantile normalization
technique (Bolstad at al., 2003), which creates equal distributions of probe
intensities for all GSM samples within the same pool of datasets.

2.2 Quantile normalization

For quantile normalization, all expression values were initially ranked
according to the expression values within each GSM sample. Second, average

expression values for all probes with the same rank in the same pool of
datasets were calculated. These average expression values constitute the
‘rank-average distribution” (Supplementary Fig. 1). Since each collection
of microarray datasets include thousands of diverse samples in various
conditions, the ‘rank-average distribution” was found mostly to follow a
normal distribution. Third, the distribution of each GSM sample was ﬁtted
into the average distribution. See the study of Bolstad at al. (2003) for further
details of quantile normalization.

Using z-transformed GSMS before quantile normalization, the
deviation of the expression distribution of each GSM from the rank-
average distribution in Supplementary Figure 1A was estimated by a X2
goodness-of—ﬁt test. We explored the relationship between the median
expression values and the X2 values of the GSMS (Supplementary
Fig. 1B and C). It should be noted that each GSM was z-transformed
as a ﬁrst step before quantile normalization. Thus, it was assumed
that the deviation of the distribution of each GSM from the average
distribution increases as the median value deviates from zero. That is, the
distribution of median expression intensities signiﬁcantly deviating from
zero could be considered a skewed distribution, due to systematic bias.
To validate this assumption, we also performed the X2 goodness-of—ﬁt test
between the average distribution and the expression data of a standard
sample from Affymetrix Company, known as the ‘Latin Square dataset”
(http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/sample_data/datasets.affx).
This dataset was originally created to test newly developed statistical
algorithms for Affymetrix GeneChip data. Thus, it was assumed that the
distribution of sample arrays from this Latin Square dataset is unbiased
and does not contain any systematic noise, and the distribution should have
a near-zero-Valued median. Based on the X2 goodness-of—ﬁt test of the
Latin Square dataset, the Latin Square dataset had a relatively small X2
value in comparison with our calculated database (DB)-wide rank-average
distribution (Supplementary Fig. 1C). This observed similarity between
the gene expression in the Latin Square dataset and the DB-wide rank
average distribution implies that the distribution of gene expression in
individual array samples follows a normal distribution, unless systematic
bias is introduced. This supports the relevance of the present quantile
normalization of ﬁtting all GSMS to rank-average distributions of DB-wide
gene expression and minimizing the systematic bias within each sample
array.

2.3 Gene-speciﬁc interpretation of transcriptome data
Probe-speciﬁc transformation of the expression data is carried out to rescale
the intensity signal of the expression data (m) of gene 1' by using the global
average expression (m) and SD (0,») of the gene (Yoon at al., 2006).

2.4 Quantitative real-time PCR analysis

Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) experiments were carried out on a human
tissue array panel purchased from Origene, USA. The panel includes a
total of 381 cDNA samples from 18 different normal and tumor tissues
(Supplementary Table 3). The PCR primers and reagents for Inhibin,
Collagen VIII, COMP and Collagen X were purchased from Applied
Biosystems. We selected pro-made, vendor-suggested Taqman assay systems
(primers and probes), HsOlO81598_m1, H500156669_m1. H500164359_m1
and HsOOl66657_m1 for probing the expression of Inhibin, Collagen VIII,
COMP and Collagen X, respectively. The qPCR reaction was carried out in
a 384-well format with an ABI 79OOHT Fast Real-Time PCR system. We
followed the standard protocol for qPCR experiments provided by Applied
Biosystems.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Global trends in gene expression

We separately integrated two independent collections of
heterogeneous microarray datasets (i.e. GPL96 and GPL570
datasets) after re-standardization of individual array samples (see
‘Section 2” for details of data standardization). For a comparative
analysis of gene-speciﬁc expressional trends in global data, the
average expression and SD of individual probe features were
calculated for each of the two integrated datasets (black plots in
Fig. 1A and B). The DB-wide average expression of genes was
found to be widely distributed in the range —2 to 3 in both the
GPL96 and GPL570 datasets. Although the GPL96 and GPL570
datasets were independent collections of array samples, they
showed a similar distribution of genes in terms of both average
expression and SD. To determine whether the observed diversity
in the DB-wide average expression and SD among genes was
random within the array-wide variability in expression, we also
calculated the expected distributions of the average expression and
SD of individual genes after randomly shufﬂing the expression
data from all microarray samples (gray plots in Fig. 1A and B).
The results showed that the observed diversity in the DB-wide
average expression and SD (black dots in Fig. 1A and B) among
genes was greater than the diversity from the random distribution
(gray dots in Fig. 1A and B). More than 20% of the genes in
the observed dataset were found to have a signiﬁcantly higher

genes. (A) The average expression and SD of each of the 22215 gene
probes found in the GPL96 platform were calculated using a total of 5018
array samples from 236 different datasets. (B) The average and SD of
each of the 54 613 probes found in the GPL570 platform were calculated
from a total of 1303 array samples in 70 different datasets. The gray dots
in (A) and (B) represent the expected distribution calculated by 22 215
and 54613 permutations (random shufﬂing) of all expression data in the
GPL96 and GPL570 datasets, respectively. (C, D) A total of 22 215 gene
probes commonly found in both the GPL570 and GPL96 platforms were
analyzed for consistency in average expression and SD between independent
collections of datasets using different platforms. (C) The average expression

or lower average expression than expected, based on the random
distribution (P < 0.01, see Supplementary Table 1 for details),
implying that the diversity of the average expression level among
genes is an intrinsic property. Furthermore, 81.8% of the genes in
the GPL96 and 72.3% of the genes in the GPL570 platform showed
signiﬁcantly lower than expected SDs (P < 0.01) in their expression
trends (Supplementary Table 1). Since the average expression and
SD of individual genes were calculated by using large collections
of diverse microarray samples, they were assumed to represent
global trends in gene expression. These results indicate that most
genes have a consistent width of variability in the global expression
trend, although the absolute expression level differs signiﬁcantly
among genes.

To conﬁrm that these two global features (average expression and
SD) are intrinsic properties of a gene, we investigated whether they
are conserved between different collections of datasets (i.e. GPL96
and GPL570 datasets). A total of 22 215 gene probes are commonly
found between both the GPL96 and GPL570 platforms. The average
expression and SD were compared between independent collections
of array samples (GPL96 and GPL570 datasets; Fig. 1C and D). The
results show that the calculated average expression of individual
probe features is highly correlated between the GPL96 and GPL570
datasets (r=0.94, Fig. 1C). This conﬁrms that the calculated
DB-wide average expression of a gene probe is an intrinsically
determined property of that gene, effectively representing the global
average expression level of the gene. Likewise, the calculated
SD of the gene expression is signiﬁcantly correlated between the
two independent datasets (r=0.83, Fig. 1D). This conﬁrms that
the observed DB-wide SD of gene expression is also an intrinsic
property of genes and that it effectively represents the global
variability of gene expression.

We also compared the global average and SD of a gene between
datasets using different probe design (Affymetrix (GPL570) versus
Illumina (GPL2700) platforms). It should be noted that arrays
produced by Affymetrix are fabricated by in situ synthesis of
25-mer oligonucleotides, while the arrays of Illumina are produced
by standard long-oligonucleotide synthesis methods, in which the
oligonucleotides are attached to microbeads that are attached to
microarrays using random self-assembly mechanism. Besides of
the difference in the physical attachment of oligonucleotide, these
two platforms are also manufactured with different probe selection
and design procedure. Affymetrix uses multiple probes for each
gene along with one-base mismatch probes as controls for non-
hybridization. On the other hand, Illumina has the randomly
generated arrays with 30 copies of the same oligonucleotide.
Therefore, we have adopted the cross-platform probe annotations
from the study of Barnes er al. (2005). They constructed the cross-
platform probe annotations with their own sequence analysis by
comparing each probe sequence of Affymetrix and Illumina with
Human genome sequence. They analyzed the relationship of cross-
platform agreement with probe location on the genome by measuring
the distance between two probes as the distance between the centers
of their alignments on the genome. This distance is considered as
the probe-matching score between cross-platforms. Thus, the cross-
platform matched probes were ranked based on the probe-matching
score between cross-platforms. That is, the shorter the distance, the
more agreement between cross-platform matched probes.

In this study, we observed that the correlation coefﬁcient
(r) for the global average expression and SD of genes were

coefﬁcient (r) for the global average expression and SD of genes,
respectively, is shown to increase as the similarity of gene probes between
GPL570 and GPL2700 platforms increase. A total of 490 array samples in
19 different datasets were used for the calculation of global average and SD

increased as the degree of agreement between cross-platform-
matched probes increase (Fig. 2A and B). Thus, a total of 8000
top-ranked probes with relatively high probe-matching were selected
to plot the global average expression and SD of individual cross-
platform-matched probes (Fig. 2C and D). We found that there
were signiﬁcant correlations (P =~0) in both the global average
expression and SD between datasets from different platforms.
These observations indicate that the intrinsic diversity of global
trends in gene expression is platform independent. However, the
intrinsic properties between cross-platform-matched probes were
relatively less conserved than the ones between same-platform-
matched probes due to the difference of probe selection and
design.

In this integrative analysis, we were able to quantitatively
determine the global expression properties of individual genes
(i.e. gene-speciﬁc average expression and SD). A statistical test
showed that these global expression properties were signiﬁcantly
diversiﬁed among genes (Fig. 1A and B). We also found that
these properties were intrinsic gene-speciﬁc features, as they were
consistent among independent collections of experiments using
different array platforms (Figs 1C, D and 2).

3.2 Gene-speciﬁc interpretation of transcriptome data

Previous methods for the analysis of microarray data have been
optimized to ﬁnd a linear correlation between the observed signal
intensity and the actual mRNA level. However, since different
genes are found to have intrinsically different expression levels and
variability (Fig. 1), necessitated by their biological functions, gene-
speciﬁc behaviors in the expression data should be considered in

prioritizing genes of biological signiﬁcance. Thus, we attempted to
rescale the intensity signal of the expression data of gene by using
the global average expression and SD of the gene (see Method
section from the study of Yoon er al., 2006 for details). With
this transformation, similar expression data among genes can be
differentially weighted depending on the genes” global average
expression level and variability. For example, if two genes in a
biological sample are observed to have similar expression levels, a
gene with an intrinsically low global expression level and variability
should be interpreted as more biologically relevant (i.e. selective
expression in the target sample versus global samples) than a gene
with a relatively high global expression level and variability. Thus,
the rescaled expression value (LAGE z-score) of a gene effectively
represents the selectivity of the observed expression in the target
sample.

Additionally, we computed a gene-speciﬁc DEG value from z,-
values of two compared samples

AZi: “i _“1'+
0i

sample and  the expression level of the i-th gene in the target
sample.

Conventional DEG analyses have focused on the mechanical
interpretation of the observed change in mRNA expression levels
between control and target samples, without any consideration of
gene-speciﬁc behaviors in transcriptional activity. However, Azi
emphasizes the biological signiﬁcance of the expressional change
of a gene in the target samples by rescaling the observed DEG
values with the gene-speciﬁc global expression variability, a. This
transformation is based on the notion that a small DEG value for a
gene with a low a value may be more biologically signiﬁcant than
a large DEG value of another gene with a large a value, given that
0 represents the intrinsic variability of the gene’s expression.

3.3 Breast cancer-selective gene expression

We applied the gene-speciﬁc analysis method to the identiﬁcation
of novel selective gene expression and cancer-speciﬁc DEGs in
breast tissue. As a proof of concept, we comparatively analyzed the
differential expression and selectivity (LAGE Az-score) between
known breast cancer prognostic markers and reference genes. The
microarray dataset (NCBI GEO ID: GSE2034) of breast cancer
tissue was used to calculate the gene-speciﬁc selective expression
value for a total of 17 probes for 11 Oncotype DX breast cancer
prognostic markers and 7 probes for 3 reference genes (Paik er al.,
2004). For those marker genes, the LAGE Az score were compared
with the differential expression levels between ER-positive and
ER-negative samples (Fig. 3A). It was observed that the prognostic
markers, in general, had higher selectivity score than the expression
level in ER-positive samples, while the reference genes had lower
selectivity score than the expression level. That is, the LAGE
selectivity score provides a better resolution in distinguishing the
expression of prognostic markers from that of reference genes.

We thus attempted to identify novel selective gene expression
and cancer-speciﬁc DEGs in breast tissue using this method.
We analyzed the microarray dataset (GDS2635) that includes
both normal and cancer breast tissues. Among 54 613 transcripts
(probe features), a total of 451 probe features were found to be

Fig. 3. Analysis of gene expression and its selectivity in breast cancer tissues.
(A) The gene-speciﬁc selective expression (Az) between ER-positive and
ER-negative breast cancer tissues (GSE2034) was calculated for a total of
17 probesets for 11 Oncotype DX breast cancer prognostic markers and 7
probesets for 3 reference genes. (B) Global average expression and SD of
genes with selective versus non-selective over-expression in breast cancers.
All of the 54 613 transcripts (probe features) in the GPL570 platform were
plotted as a gray circle in the background. A total of 451 probe features were
found to be over-expressed with at least a 2-fold change and P < 0.01 in the
t-test. Among them, 272 and 73 probe features with over 2- and 4-fold non-
selective over-expression were plotted with empty orange and red circles,
respectively. The 47 and 59 probe features with over 2- and 4-fold selective
over-expression were plotted with ﬁlled orange and red circles, respectively.
The selectivity was determined with a P value cutoff of 0.01 for Az.

over-expressed in breast cancers with at least a 2-fold change
with P <0.01 from a t-test (Fig. 3B). From the gene-speciﬁc
interpretation (Az) of DEG, we found that 272 and 73 probe features
with over 2- and 4-fold over-expression, respectively, were non-
selective in breast cancers (P for Az is >0.01), while 47 and 59
probe features with over 2- and 4-fold over-expression, respectively,
were selective in breast cancers (P for Az is <0.01). It is clearly
shown that probe features of large DEG (>4-fold over-expression)
tend to have higher global SD than those of moderate DEG (>2-
fold over-expression). In addition, probe features with selective (P
for Az is <0.01) over-expression in breast cancers tend to have
smaller global SD than genes with non-selective (P for Az is <0.01)
over-expression. A large SD of the expression of a gene in global
samples implies a relatively non-selective over-expression in various
biological samples or conditions. Since highly over-expressed genes
in Figure 3B tend to have large SDs, it will be difﬁcult to ﬁnd
breast cancer-speciﬁc expression among them. In fact, many existing
statistical methods for microarray analysis cannot prioritize target-
selective gene expression over many non-selective over-expressed
genes, because they just emphasize genes with a high magnitude
of change that far exceeds the observed variability in expression

Among genes with >4-fold over-expression (P < 0.01 from t-statistics) in breast cancer
versus normal breast tissue, breast cancer-selective (high z) gene expression and speciﬁc
DEG (high Az) between normal and cancer tissues were identiﬁed by the gene-speciﬁc
rescaling methods. 0 represents the global SD of the gene expression calculated from
1303 samples in the GPL570 datasets. Genes listed in bold were further analyzed for
the DB-wide expression proﬁling in Figure 4.

(Rarnaswamy er al., 2001). However, through the gene-speciﬁc
interpretation of DEG (Az), we could select genes of over a 4-fold
change in breast cancers and a relatively small global SD, which
implies speciﬁc over-expression in breast cancers.

For ﬁirther validation, we ﬁrst selected a total of 132 probe
features (genes) with >4-fold over-expression and high statistical
conﬁdence (P < 0.01 in t-distribution) in the breast cancer tissue, as
compared to normal breast tissue. We then applied the gene-speciﬁc
rescaling process to the expression data of the selected genes. As
a result, the expression data of eight genes showed that they were
selectively expressed in breast cancer (z> 1.6). Additionally, the
Az values of these genes, as compared between normal and cancer
tissues, were signiﬁcant over the other genes (P < 0.01 for the
Az value) (ﬁrst eight genes in Table 1). In contrast, six of the over-
expressed genes were found to have relatively low LAGE selectivity
(z< 1.6) in breast cancer and exhibited insigniﬁcant Az between
normal and cancer tissues (P > 0.05 for the Az value) (last six genes
in Table 1).

Before we experimentally tested the breast cancer selectivity of
the expression pattern of these genes, we veriﬁed the reproducibility
of the over-expression pattern by examining another microarray
dataset from the integrated DB samples. We generated DB-wide
expression proﬁles for the selected genes, using all 1303 integrated
array samples from 70 different datasets. In addition to the analyzed
breast cancer dataset (GDS2635) in Figure 3 and Table 1, two other
datasets contained breast cancer tissues (GDS2250 and GDS2046).
As a result, among the 14 over-expressed genes shown in Table 1,
only four genes (Inhibin, Collagen VIII, COMP and Collagen X)
were shown to have consistent over-expression patterns in breast

Fig. 4. DB-wide expression proﬁles of four genes with over-expression in
breast cancer tissues. While Inhibin and Cllagen VIII showed non-selective
over-expression, the expression of COMP and Collagen X in breast cancer
was highly selective over other biological samples. The expression trends of
selected genes were investigated in the integrated DB samples. The x-axis
represents a total of 1303 array samples from 70 datasets sharing the GPL570
platform. The red line represents the expression level in breast cancer tissue
samples, while the blue line represents the expression level in normal breast
tissue. The square box represents the dataset (GDS2635) that was used for
the initial gene selection in Table 1.

cancer tissues in the two additional datasets (Fig. 4). Based on
this observation, we used the data of these four genes for ﬁirther
experimentation.

The global SD of the selected genes (0 in Table 1) is assumed to
represent the intrinsic variability of the gene’s expression. COMP
and Collagen X were found to have low a values and high selectivity
to breast cancer (Table 1). Consistently, the DB-wide expression
proﬁle showed that they had consistently low expression in most
of the DB samples and exceptionally high expression in only a
few DB samples, including the breast cancer samples (Fig. 4).
On the other hand, Inhibin and Collagen VIII were found to have
relatively high a values and low selectivity to breast cancer (Table 1).
Consistently, their DB-wide expression proﬁles showed that they
had high expression in many DB samples, in addition to breast
cancer tissues (Fig. 4).

3.4 Selectivity analysis by qPCR

Using qPCR, we experimentally investigated the global expression
trend of these four selected genes in diverse human tissue samples,
including breast cancer and normal breast samples (Fig. 5). COMP
and Collagen X showed the highest expression levels in breast
cancer tissues among the 18 different human tissues compared.
Although Inhibin and Collagen VIII also showed high expression
in breast cancer tissues, they showed similar or higher expression
in many other types of normal and cancer tissues. This qPCR result
agrees well with our gene-speciﬁc interpretation of the microarray
data shown in Table 1 and Figure 4. Using the qPCR results, the
experimental selectivity score of gene expression in breast cancer
was also compared among the four genes (Supplementary Table 2).
The equation used for the z-score was again employed for the
selectivity scoring of the qPCR results, and the u, [r and a values
for each gene were derived from the 381 observed qPCR expression

Fig. 5. The results of qPCR analysis of the expression of four selected genes
in diverse human tissues. cDNAs from a total of 381 normal and tumor
samples from 18 different human tissues were used for the analysis. The
number of samples for each tissue type is found in Supplementary Table 3.

data points. Consistent with the DB-derived z scores, the qPCR
selectivity score showed that the expression of COMP and Collagen
X is more selective to breast cancer than that of Inhibin and Collagen
VIII.

Likewise, in the DEG (i.e. fold change) analysis between normal
and cancer samples in 18 different human tissues, the DEG values of
COMP and Collagen X in breast tissue were observed to be higher
than the DEGs measured for other types of tissues. The DEGs of
Inhibin and Collagen VIII in breast tissue were not distinguishable
from the DEGs in many other tissues (Fig. 5). In this qPCR analysis,
Inhibin and COMP showed a similar level of DEG (~2-fold change)
in breast tissue. However, only the DEG of COMP was uniquely high
in breast samples among the 18 compared tissues. Inhibin showed
higher DEG values in colon, lymph node, stomach and urinary
bladder samples, as compared to breast tissue. Thus, in a biological
sense, it is clear that the over-expression of COMP is more speciﬁc
to breast cancer than of other similarly over-expressed genes. In the
analysis of global expression trends, COMP was found to have a low
variability in gene expression, while Inhibin was a relatively highly
variable gene (Table 1). By using this intrinsic difference between
these two genes for the interpretation of a microarray dataset, we
could successfully prioritize COMP (P < 0.01Az value) over Inhibin
(P > 0.05Az value) as a breast cancer-speciﬁc gene, although both
genes showed a signiﬁcant DEG in breast cancer samples (>4-fold
change and P <0.01 for t-test).

It has already been shown that these four genes are over-expressed
in several types of human cancer (Aigner er al., 1997; Bettelheim
et al., 1984; Liao et al., 2003; Sheth er al., 1984). However, the over-
expression of COMP and Collagen X in breast cancer tissues has
not been previously reported. Therefore, the breast cancer speciﬁcity
of these two genes, as compared to other cancers, has not yet been
clariﬁed. It is obvious that the identiﬁcation of tissue selectivity
or disease speciﬁcity in the study of gene expression is of critical
importance in accelerating mechanistic studies and/or biomarker
discovery. We have demonstrated that the expression of COMP

and Collagen X in breast cancer is highly selective, as compared
to many other types of human tissues and cancers, despite that the
level of over-expression in breast cancer was not uniquely high in
comparison to that of other non-selective over-expressed genes, such
as Inhibin and Collagen VIII.

4 DISCUSSION

In the protein—protein interaction network, COMP and Collagen X
have relatively few interacting partners compared to Inhibin and
Collagen VIII (Fig. 6), suggesting that COMP and Collagen X are
topologically and functionally peripheral in the cellular network,
while Inhibin and Collagen VIII are hub proteins. It has been
reported that essential genes are likely to encode hub proteins
and are expressed widely in most tissues (Goh er al., 2007; Han
et al., 2004; Jeong et al., 2001). Goh er al. (2007) also found that
the vast majority of disease genes were non-essential and without
tendency of encoding hub proteins. They provided an explanation
for most disease genes using an evolutionary argument, such that
only disease-related mutations in the functionally and topologically
peripheral regions of the cell have a higher chance of viability.
Consistently, the present study shows that two hub proteins, Inhibin
and Collagen VIII, are over-expressed in many different normal
and cancer tissues, indicating that their expression is essential and
not speciﬁc to a disease. On the other hand, two peripheral genes,
COMP and Collagen X, show highly selective over-expression
in breast cancers, thus suggesting that their expression is non-
essential and speciﬁc to breast cancers. This analysis demonstrates
that the gene-speciﬁc interpretation of transcriptome data is able to
distinguish non-essential disease-related genes from essential genes
with over-expression in various tissues.

In conclusion, the selective expression of COMP and Collagen
X in breast cancer, observed by qPCR experiments, supports
the hypothesis that gene-speciﬁc interpretation of microarray data
allows highly sample-speciﬁc gene expression to be distinguished
from non-selective over-expression, without large-scale experiments
on various samples. In a transcriptome-wide study, such as a
microarray experiment, a large number of candidate genes with
signiﬁcant over-expression in target samples are often identiﬁed.
Thus, it is challenging to determine candidates of more direct or
speciﬁc importance to a target disease or the metabolic regulation
of speciﬁc samples. In this study, we have shown that gene-speciﬁc
interpretation of microarray data can be used to prioritize genes
with greater selective expression to speciﬁc tissues over many other
over-expressed genes.

We believe that a transcriptome-wide survey of the global trends
in gene expression is of critical importance to better interpreting
large-scale gene expression data. Given that individual genes each
have their own regulatory system for transcriptional activity, the
analysis of global expression trends can provide a direct measure
of a gene’s intrinsic expressional behavior. The present study shows
that DB-wide average and SD of gene (probe feature) expression
are an effective measure of the intrinsic expressional behavior
of a gene and that they can be used for better interpretation of
microarray data. Some of intrinsic properties observed in this study
might reﬂect characteristics of probes themselves. Thus, the present
gene-speciﬁc rescaling method also minimizes the probe-speciﬁc
variation in the interpretation of microarray data. Rapid increases
in public microarray data will ﬁirther improve the quality of this

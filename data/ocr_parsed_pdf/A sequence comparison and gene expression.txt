between organisms. Analysis of point mutations%specially in
the 5’ region of genes, where they might account for signiﬁcant
changes in expression levels (Yu et al., 2009%requires repeated
gene browsing, sequence export into FASTA files and alignment
using external tools, as this system lacks a built—in sequence
alignment feature. Therefore, we introduced an expanded
CLUSTAL W alignment (Larkin et al., 2007) to compare ortho—
logs of a selected gene at DNA sequence level. Organisms that
should be included in the alignment are selected in the same way
as for display in the multi—genome browser. A user—def1ned
number of base pairs in 5’ direction of the gene can be included
into the alignment. The initial CLUSTAL alignment is processed
to include a header describing all aligned genes; additional
5’ sequences are highlighted by capitalization, and accurate pos—
ition information relative to the start of the gene is provided. The
ﬁnal result is presented in a dialog window from where it can be
saved as text file.

2.3 IS element annotation and analysis

IS elements are a major cause of genomic modiﬁcations that may
change a cell’s phenotype dramatically even during relatively
short—termed experiments under non—mutagenic conditions, as re—
cently demonstrated (Gaffe et al., 2011). They are short mobile
genetic elements encoding only functions involved in their mobil—
ity. A dedicated database, IS Finder (Siguier et al., 2006), gives
detailed information about individual ISs and their taxonomy. To
analyse IS abundance and activity, we integrated a systematic IS
annotation as well as suitable cross—species comparison tools.

The IS taxonomy tree of families, groups and types is placed
within the ‘Paralogous Gene Groups’ class of each PGDB. A
menu link to the root of this tree, combined with Pathway
Tools’ generic class tree navigation, allows easy browsing of
the IS taxonomy. As IS types behave like ordinary paralogous
gene groups, they proﬁt from all display and browsing options
provided for such groups, e.g. clickable links from IS types to
speciﬁc transposase genes and vice versa or location maps of all
genes of a certain type.

IS element annotation is facilitated by a system of dialog win—
dows that provides selection of defined IS types as well as easy
creation of new taxonomy entries. When IS element annotation
is complete in all strains of interest, and orthologous genes are
linked to each other across all PGDBs, a species comparison
function creates tables of all IS element loci in each organism,
including information about adjacent genes; for each other or—
ganism, the orthologous IS element locus (if present) and the
percentage of sequence identity in the 5000 bp up— and down—
stream region of the IS element locus are reported. A summary
table lists all groups of orthologous IS element loci and thereby
allows rapid detection of shared as well as singleton loci.

2.3 Mapping of microarray probes and gene
expression data

Pathway Tools’ omics and pathway viewers offer many ways to
visualize gene expression in genomic, metabolomic and regula—
tory context. Efficient use of these features implies accurate as—
signment of probes to PGDB genes, but using gene names
provided in array design files often leads to unsatisfactory results
(see Supplementary Material). We therefore introduce tools to
map probes to PGDB genomes by probe sequences and facilitate
preprocessing of gene expression data before visualization.

Microarray probes can be imported from tab—delimited text
files (e. g. GAL or ADF files) using a generic parser that prompts
the user to select proper probe ID and sequence columns. Probes
are mapped to target genomes/PGDBs by BLAST (Altschul
et al., 1997), followed by extraction of strong hits. Mapping re—
sults are stored in the PGDBs directory in GFF2 format, which
allows displaying probe target annotation as additional track in
Pathway Tools’ genome browser. A tabular text file is created,
containing probe IDs, their target gene IDs and names as well as
the percent alignment identity, which facilitates the identification
of imperfect or cross—talking matches.

To map expression data to the genome, tab—delimited data files
are merged with probe—target—mappings mentioned above. A
configuration ﬁle defines how expression data are organized
into different tracks; time series, dye swap, clusters and optional
selection/highlighting of targets on either strand are supported.
Results are stored in two formats: GFF2 to be visualized in the
genome browser, and tab—delimited text files that link expression
levels to PGDB—internal gene IDs for visualization in Pathway
Tools’ cellular and pathway overview diagrams.

Abstract

Motivation: Bacterial resistance to antibiotics, particularly plasmid—encoded resistance to beta lac—
tam drugs, poses an increasing threat to human health. Point mutations to beta—lactamase en—
zymes can greatly alter the level of resistance conferred, but predicting the effects of such muta—
tions has been challenging due to the large combinatorial space involved and the subtle
relationships of distant residues to catalytic function. Therefore we desire an information—theoretic
metric to sensitively and robustly detect both local and distant residues that affect substrate con—
formation and catalytic activity.

Results: Here, we report the use of positional mutual information in multiple microsecond—length
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to predict residues linked to catalytic activity of the CTX—M9
beta lactamase. We find that motions of the bound drug are relatively isolated from motions of the
protein as a whole, which we interpret in the context of prior theories of catalysis. In order to ro—
bustly identify residues that are weakly coupled to drug motions but nonetheless affect catalysis,
we utilize an excess mutual information metric. We predict 31 such residues for the cephalosporin
antibiotic cefotaxime. Nine of these have previously been tested experimentally, and all decrease
both enzyme rate constants and empirical drug resistance. We prospectively validate our method
by testing eight high—scoring mutations and eight low—scoring controls in bacteria. Six of eight pre—
dicted mutations decrease cefotaxime resistance greater than 2—fold, while only one control shows
such an effect. The ability to prospectively predict new variants affecting bacterial drug resistance
is of great interest to clinical and epidemiological surveillance.

Beta lactamases are enzymes produced by bacteria that confer resist—
ance to a broad range of clinically used antibiotics that share a com—
mon chemical core structure (Llarrull et (11., 2010; Matagne et (11.,
1998). Use of these drugs has led to the emergence of beta lacta—
mases with a broad spectrum of activity that render many classes of
antibiotics ineffective (Boucher et 111., 20133). In the past, this has

pipeline has slowed in recent decades, creating a clinical problem of
highly resistant infections (Boucher et al., 2013b; Levy and
Marshall, 2004). Understanding the determinants of activity and
specificity in beta lactamases is key to both monitoring the emer—
gence of further resistance and the targeted design of new antibacter—
ial agents. Here, we focus on the CTX—M family, a group of

extended spectrum beta lactamases that have spread globally in re—
cent years and utilize a catalytic mechanism roughly analogous to
serine proteases (Shimamura et 41]., 2002). CTX—M enzymes are cur—
rently the most prevalent extended—spectrum beta lactamases in
both hospital—associated and community—acquired infections and are
thus of substantial clinical concern (Canton and Coque, 2006;
Valverde et 41]., 2004). Even when the resulting infections are treat—
able, presence of a CTX—M enzyme greatly increases the morbidity
resulting from bacterial infection (Canton and Coque, 2006;
Livermore et al., 2007; Philippon et 41]., 1989).

Although the key catalytic residues in CTX—M enzymes are well
known, we wish to understand the basis for modulation of activity
and ligand specificity in these enzymes. Even though comprehensive
mutagenesis of CTX—M has not yet been experimentally feasible, re—
ports of individual mutations show that single point mutations can
alter drug spectrum and catalytic activity (Aumeran et 41]., 2003;
Gazouli et 41]., 1998; Perez—Llarena et 41]., 2011, 2008; Sougakoff
et 41]., 1988). Such point mutants have been identified in clinical iso—
lates of bacteria (Bonnet et 41]., 2001, 2003; Delmas et 41]., 2006;
Poirel et 41]., 2002) as well as laboratory mutagenesis experiments
(Aumeran et 41]., 2003; Gazouli et 41]., 1998; Perez—Llarena et 41].,
2011, 2008; Sougakoff et 41]., 1988).

A comprehensive experimental understanding of how mutations
affect beta lactamase drug resistance has been hindered by the com—
binatorial magnitude of the problem. Even for point mutations on
CTX—M enzymes alone, rigorous quantitation of how mutants affect
activity against a large panel of drugs is extremely resource—
intensive, entailing the screening of ~5 000 mutants (260 residues X
19 amino acid changes) against multiple antibiotics. Therefore, we
wish to identify residues that may contribute to activity and specifi—
city but are not absolutely essential to function. Prediction of such
residues can guide a more targeted set of mutagenesis experiments.
In designing such an approach, we wish to consider all residues in
the protein, not simply those in direct contact with the drug or previ—
ously identified via serendipitous mutations.

We have chosen to predict residues modulating antibiotic resist—
ance in CTX—M enzymes based on analysis of molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations. We hypothesize that the conformational dy—
namics of the enzyme and its substrate will yield insight into cata—
lytic activity even though we do not consider catalysis explicitly in
classical MD simulations, unlike reactive methods (Hermann et 41].,
2009; Nichols et 41]., 2015; Xu et 41]., 2007). Classical MD simula—
tions have been previously used to predict or explain mutations in a
number of enzyme systems (Karplus and Kuriyan, 2005; Rod et 41].,
2003; Watney et 41]., 2003).

To predict individual residues to mutate, we seek to identify the
inﬂuence of individual atoms on catalytic activity rather than overall
conformational substates of the enzyme. MD simulations provide a
means to quantify this ‘inﬂuence’ by measuring positional related—
ness between protein atoms and a bound drug, based on the hypoth—
esis that the conformation and orientation of the drug and its
environment are related to catalytic activity. We sample conform—
ations from MD simulations, which estimate a Boltzmann—weighted
ensemble.

Positional mutual information provides a robust non—linear met—
ric to quantify relatedness of positional displacement in MD simula—
tions (Cover and Thomas, 2012; Kasson et 41]., 2009). Normalized
covariance matrices have also been used for such measurements
(Kamberaj and van der Vaart, 2009; Karplus and Kushick, 1981),
but such approaches are restricted by a linear correlation approxi—
mation (Ichiye and Karplus, 1991; Lange and Grubmiiller, 2006),
which is less desirable for detecting subtle yet important motions.

Mutual information quantifies how much knowledge of the prob—
ability distribution of positional displacement for one atom i affects
the distribution for another atom / and thus provides a much more
general means of detecting relatedness.

Although positional mutual information has been used to ana—
lyze large—scale movements in a manner analogous to principal com—
ponents analysis (Brandman et 41]., 2012; Lange and Grubmiiller,
2006), here we desire a more focused approach. To predict residues
important to catalytic activity, we score by mutual information to
drug conformation. This is corrected for bulk protein movement,
yielding excess mutual information

I(i, drug) — I(i, protein_background), (1)

where I(i,/') denotes the mutual information between residues 1' and /
(Kasson et 41]., 2009). Such a metric encapsulates the precise ques—
tion ‘how related is movement of atom i to the drug conformation’.
This metric is designed to identify functionally important residues
that meet this criterion; it is of course not designed to detect residues
that might not be motionally correlated with the drug but still im—
portant to catalysis.

Simulations and analysis were performed on the CTX—M9 beta
lactamase in complex with one of two antibiotics: cefotaxime and
meropenem (Fig. 1). CTX—M enzymes hydrolyze antibiotics by way
of an acyl—enzyme intermediate where the antibiotic is covalently
bound to the enzyme (Chen et 41]., 2005). CTX—M9 is able to effi—
ciently hydrolyze cefotaxime, whereas it only forms the acyl inter—
mediate for meropenem without completing hydrolysis (Chen et 41].,
2005). The conformational dynamics of this intermediate may thus
yield insight into the residues important for hydrolytic specificity in
these enzymes. The positional mutual information matrices for both
CTX—M9zmeropenem and CTX—M9zcefotaxime complexes yield im—
portant insight regarding the organization of these enzymes. We
then score residues that may affect catalytic activity of CTX—M9
using excess mutual information. These predictions yield a set of
residues that have previously been identified as affecting catalytic
activity and a set of novel, previously untested predictions. To valid—
ate our predictions, we tested the top—scoring residues for CTX—
M9:meropenem and CTX—M9zcefotaxime via alanine mutagenesis,
a common means to assess the effect of ablating a residue side chain.
Six of these eight mutants had a >2—fold decrease in cefotaxime re—
sistance while only one of the four lowest scoring residues for CTX—

2.1 MD simulations

We obtained the apo crystal structure of CT X—M9 from the Protein
Data Bank (PDB Code 2P74) (Chen et (11., 2007). The acylated
meropenem structure was generated by least—squares RMSD fitting
of the acyl—meropenem intermediate of SHV—1 (PDB Code 2ZD8)
(Nukaga et (11., 2007) with missing atoms added via rigid—body fit—
ting. The acylated CTX—M9zcefotaxime structure was generated via
least squares rigid—body alignment of all common atoms on the beta
lactam ring of meropenem and cefotaxime on a Thr71Ser CTX—M9
mutant. Meropenem and cefotaxime were parameterized using the
Amber Antechamber program with AM1—BCC partial charges (Case
et (11., 2005). All simulations were run using Gromacs 4.5 with the
AMBER99SB—ILDN force field and TIP3P explicit water (Hornak
et (11., 2006; Lindorff—Larsen et (11., 2010; Pronk et (11., 2013) in a
periodic octahedral box with a minimum periodic image separation
of 2nm. The solvent consisted of approximately 24 000 water mol—
ecules and 150 mM NaCl. Simulations were run with a 2 fs time
step and hydrogen bonds were constrained using LINCS (Hess et (11.,
1997). The temperature was maintained at 37°C using a velocity—
rescaling thermostat (Bussi et (11., 2007) and the pressure was main—
tained at 1 bar with a coupling constant of 10 ps. Short—range non—
bonded and electrostatic interactions were truncated at 1.2 nm, and
long—range electrostatics were treated with Particle Mesh Ewald
(Darden et (11., 1993).

CTX—M9zmeropenem simulations were then run using the
Folding@Home platform, and CTX—M9zcefotaxime simulations
were run on a Cray XC30 or on NVidia GPGPUs. 200 independent
simulations were run of CTX—M9zmeropenem complexes; 22 of
these were randomly selected for subsampled analysis, totaling
2460 ns with a median simulation length of 106 ns. The first 46 ns of
each simulation were discarded and the remaining aggregate
2150 ns used for analysis. Three longer independent simulations
CTX—M9zcefotaxime complexes were analyzed; two simulations
had lengths of 954 ns and one of 289 ns, after truncation, totaling
2197 ns. Snapshots were recorded every 50 ps.

2.2 Mutual information analysis of CTX—M9 dynamics
We calculated displacements for all atoms of the CTX—M9zdrug
complex after rigid—body alignment of the binding pocket to the
starting structure of each respective simulation. For this purpose, the
binding pocket was defined as residues having at least one non—
hydrogen atom within 1 nm of the acylated drug carbonyl in >90%
of simulation snapshots and where the root—mean—squared positional
ﬂuctuation of the backbone atoms was <7  Alignment using the
binding pocket as a reference was chosen to minimize artifactual
drug motion from alignment error; a comparison where alignment
was performed on the whole protein is presented in the
Supplementary Material and yields similar results. These displace—
ments where i is the index of each atom and t is the time from the
initial alignment structure were then used to calculate mutual infor—
mation and symmetric uncertainty in a fashion similar to that which
we have reported previously (Kasson et al., 2009). Mutual informa—
tion I (i, i) was calculated between two atoms 1', i using

vals min(d,-(t),Vt) to max(d,-(t),Vt) and min(d,-(t),Vt) to
max(d,-(t),Vt).

Mutual information values were then normalized using symmetric
uncertainty, which represents the relatedness of a pair of atoms inde—
pendent of the motion undergone by each atom

where k are atoms in the beta—lactam ring of the drug (C6, C7, C8,
N10 and 09 for cefotaxime and C5, C6, C7, N4 and 071 for mero—
penem) and l are all atoms not in the binding pocket defined as
above.

2.3 Sequence retrieval and processing

CTX—M family nucleotide sequences were retrieved using published
accession numbers (Canton et (11., 2012). These sequences were then
translated and individually aligned to a protein sequence of CTX—
M9 (ACR66304.1) using TBLASTN (Altschul et (11., 1990;
Leinberger et (11., 2010). Resulting sequences were aligned using
MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004). From this alignment, a consensus sequence
was generated for all residues identical across the CT X—M9 family
to identify conserved residues.

2.4 Creation and resistance measurements of mutants
We performed site—directed alanine mutagenesis on selected residues
in CTX—M9 (Saladin et (11., 2002). Mutants were tested for cefotax—
ime resistance using a Kirby—Bauer antibiotic disc assay (Bauer
et (11., 1959). Bacteria were grown to an optical density of 0.1 and
then evenly spread on Mueller Hinton agar plates with a cefotaxime
antibiotic disc placed in the center. The diameter of clearance was
measured after 12—16h of incubation. Resistance was measured as
fold—change in apparent inhibitory concentration, calculated as the
squared diameter of clearance for CTX wild—type divided by the
square of the diameter of the mutant.

3 Results

We used positional mutual information to analyze the conform—
ational dynamics of CTX—M9 with a bound antibiotic, either cefo—
taxime or meropenem, based on MD simulations. Multiple
microsecond—length simulations were used to obtain good statistical
sampling of positional motions of the enzyme—drug complex.
Mutual information provides a non—linear analogue to measure cor—
related motions. This approach identifies pairs and networks of
atoms that are dynamically related and thus statistically interact ei—
ther directly or indirectly. When applied to the active site of an en—
zyme, it thus enables a unified analysis of short—range and long—
range interactions that may inﬂuence catalysis and in this case drug
resistance. Furthermore, by measuring the excess mutual informa—
tion of protein atoms to the drug compared to the rest of the protein,
we identified residues that may inﬂuence the dynamics of the bound
beta lactam ring and potentially subsequent drug hydrolysis.

3.1 Pairwise symmetric uncertainty to analyze
positional relationships in CTX—M9

To quantify pairwise relationships between all pairs of atoms in the
CTX—M9zdrug complex, we calculated a positional symmetric un—
certainty matrix based on MD simulation trajectories. Symmetric
uncertainty was used as a normalized information—theoretic metric
of positional relatedness (calculated by dividing mutual information
by the sum of entropies, see Section 2 for details). For cefotaxime,
this yields a 3977 X 3977 matrix. Because the size of this matrix is
N2 in the number of atoms, we selected the top 0.25% of inter—
actions (5% squared) for analysis or the top 19 771 pairs. Similarly,
symmetric uncertainty analysis of CTX—M9zmeropenem yielded a
3992 X 3992 matrix where the top 19 920 pairs comprise the top
0.25% of interactions.

At a coarse level, the resulting symmetric uncertainty matrices
show, as expected, strong relationships between directly interacting
atoms as well as stabilization of secondary structure elements.
Thresholded matrices for CTX—M9zcefotaxime and CTX—
M9:meropenem complexes are plotted in Figures 2B and 3B, and
the top—scoring interactions are rendered as dotted lines on the pro—
tein structure in Figures 2A and 3A. This analysis yields statistically
coupled yet spatially distant atom pairs as well as a number of
strong interactions from directly contacting atoms, as discussed
below. The strong near—diagonal band reﬂects the expected high
symmetric uncertainty for atoms that are directly connected by
bonded interactions; in addition, salt bridges and van der Waals
contacts between sequence—distant but spatially proximate atoms
also resulted in pairs with high symmetric uncertainty. Secondary
structural elements are typically strongly connected, except when
such structures are so strongly stabilized that they are immobile over
the multi—microsecond timescales sampled and thus have near—zero
positional entropy. Also present in the high—scoring pairs are inter—
actions between nearby secondary structural elements. For example,
in the CTX—M9zcefotaxime simulations, a number of high—scoring
pairs were measured between the alpha helix containing residues
Ala28—Ser40 (Fig. 2A, atom indices 45—243) and the helix contain—
ing residues Arg276—Ala287 (atom indices 3752—3953).

One striking finding is the lack of strong relationships between
the bound drug and the major catalytic residues and similarly be—
tween the drug—binding pocket and the rest of the enzyme in both sets
of simulations. The highest—scoring drug—protein symmetric uncer—
tainty value occurs below our 99.75% statistical cutoff, and such link—
ages remain sparse even at much lower cutoffs (Figs. 2D and 3D).
This suggests that the drug and catalytic geometry are relatively iso—
lated from conformational ﬂuctuations of the rest of the protein. Such
a finding makes sense in light of theories of catalytic preorganization
in enzymes, which can be interpreted to state that optimal catalytic ef—
ficiency results from minimal ﬂuctuations of the catalytic residues
(Warshel, 1998, 2002). This is well supported by crystallographic
studies of CTX—M9 alone and in complex with different transition—
state analogues; in one such series of structures, key catalytic residues
such as Ser130, Lys73, Glu166 and Ser237 shift only an average of
0.1  over a set of substrate analogues spanning the catalytic cycle
(Chen et (11., 2005).

Despite this relative isolation, symmetric uncertainty analysis of
CTX—M9zcefotaxime yielded one potentially important network
involving Asn104, Arg276 and Asn170. This network is connected
by linkages at the 99.5th percentile, below our statistical cutoff, but
stronger than any other networks of spatially distant residues.
Although none of these residues is directly involved in catalysis, pre—
vious work has suggested they have a strong role in function.

tions for sites where mutation will affect catalytic activity and drug resist-
ance. The drug is shown in red online, residues identified in both
enzyme:drug complexes in orange and residues identified in only one en-

Asn170 is believed to be involved in establishing the hydrogen bond
network (Delmas et al., 2008) with the catalytic water molecule
while Asn104 directly interacts with acylamide side chain of cefo—
taxime (Shimamura et al., 2002). None of these interactions met the
pre—defined threshold for significance in our analysis, but they con—
stitute intriguing candidates for further testing.

3.2 Excess mutual information identifies residues linked
to drug motion

While symmetric uncertainty enables a global analysis of statistical
interaction networks in the protein—drug complex, a more targeted
statistical metric is desired to identify residues associated with particu—
lar motions of the bound drug. Excess mutual information quantifies
drug—protein positional coupling in a fashion corrected for protein
motions and capable of robustly identifying even weak but physically
significant coupling. Excess mutual information measures the sym—
metric uncertainty between a protein atom and the beta—lactam ring
but corrects for bulk protein motion by subtracting the average sym—
metric uncertainty to the rest of the protein (see Section 2 for details).
The top 5% of protein atoms as scored via excess mutual information
to the beta—lactam ring were then selected for both CT X—
M9:cefotaxime and CTX—M9zmeropenem (Table 1 and Fig. 4). These
top—scoring atoms yield a prediction of functionally important resi—
dues for beta—lactam hydrolysis for CTX—M9. The top 5% of atoms
scored by excess mutual information in CTX—M9zcefotaxime simula—
tions covered 35 residues, 31 after removing ‘singleton’ residues with
only one atom selected (of 265 residues total).

Of these, nine have previously been tested via mutagenesis ex—
periments, and in all nine mutations were confirmed to reduce cata—
lytic activity, as assessed by a decrease in both km and minimum
inhibitory concentration of drug to impede bacterial growth
(Altschul et al., 1990; Aumeran et al., 2003; Edgar, 2004; Gazouli
et al., 1998; Pérez—Llarena et al., 2011; Shimamura et al., 2002). In
addition, 17 of the 31 residues are sequence—identical across the
CTX—M family using the family definition provided in (Canton
et al., 2012). Of the 10 top—scoring residues, 7 are sequence—
identical across CTX—M9, and 3 have been previously tested and
confirmed via experimental mutagenesis. This degree of sequence
conservation further, although indirectly, supports a functional role
for the residues thus identified.

Residues predicted by excess mutual information include amino
acids both in the drug—binding pocket and distant from it (allosteric
mutations). This second category (including Leu33, Val45, Ala245,
Ala263 and Tyr264) is particularly interesting, as they are more dif—
ficult to identify via conventional methods. Previous experimental
mutagenesis has shown that allosteric mutations can affect hydroly—
sis of cephalosporins via beta lactamase enzymes (Pérez—Llarena
et al., 2011), and the prediction of novel allosteric mutations is a
major goal of this work. Recent work based on evolutionary conser—
vation has proposed distance to the active site as a means to score
functional importance of enzymes (Jack et al., 2016). In our data,
excess mutual information scores showed correlation values of (0.27
and 0.56) with distance to the catalytic residues, explaining 7.6 and
31% of the variance in MI respectively (see Supplementary
Material), demonstrating that for this system excess mutual infor—
mation contains information other than purely distance. In addition,
high—scoring residues ranked moderately in positional mobility (top—
scoring residues in CTX—M9zcefotaxime simulations have root—
mean—squared ﬂuctuation of 1.4—1.9  compared to an overall
range of 0.53—7.72  and median 1.6

Fig. 5. Mutation of top-ranking residues via positional mutual information
greatly decreases cefotaxime drug resistance. The five highest-scoring resi-
dues for cefotaxime (orange online) and meropenem (yellow with residues in
both sets as red) were selected for alanine mutagenesis. These were located
both inside and distant from the drug pocket (A). Six of the eight mutants dis-
played a >2-fold drop in resistance

Corresponding analysis of the CTX—M9zmeropenem complex
yielded a number of residues in common with CTX—M9zcefotaxime
(Fig. 4). The top 5% of atoms scored via excess mutual information
mapped to 37 residues, 32 after singleton removal. Of these 32 resi—
dues, 17 were in common with CTX—M9zcefotaxime, and the re—
maining 15 diverged. Although it is tempting to analyze differential
scoring between the CTX—M9zmeropenem simulations and the
CTX—M9zcefotaxime simulations as relating to the capacity of CTX—
M9 to hydrolyze cefotaxime but not meropenem, we wish to remain
conservative in this respect as the simulation sampling scheme dif—
fered slightly between CTX—M9zcefotaxime (fewer and longer simu—
lations) and CTX—M9zmeropenem (more simulations of 100—200 ns
in length), and we cannot exclude a sampling bias in accounting for
the different residues identified. Common residues included several
involved in catalysis either directly or indirectly such as Ser237 and
Arg276 (Chen et al., 2005; Perez—Llarena et al., 2008). Top—scoring
residues from CTX—M9zmeropenem (but not CTX—M9zcefotaxime)
included Ser130 and Glu166, two residues closely tied to catalytic
function (Glu166 is believed by many to be the general base for
cephalosporin hydrolysis in CT X—M enzymes) (Chen et al., 2005;
Delmas et al., 2008; Tomanicek et al., 2011). The identification of
these residues suggests that although CTX—M9 cannot fully hydro—
lyze meropenem, catalytic residues still interact with the drug in a
coordinated manner.

largely unaffected. As rendered in panel (A), the lowest-scoring residues
and (B) the residues with closest to background mutual information in cefo-

were located outside the drug-binding pocket. As plotted in panel (C), none of

alanine. We used antibiotic resistance of transformed bacteria ex—
pressing each enzyme as a metric of enzymatic function. As a con—
trol, we also mutated the four lowest—scoring residues and four
residues that scored closest to zero excess mutual information (rela—
tionship to drug motion equal to the average across the protein). Of
the top—scoring residues, 6/8 had a greater than 2—fold reduction in
cefotaxime antibiotic resistance (Fig. 5), with all mutants showing
some reduction in resistance. Four of the most affected top—scoring
residues were located near the drug—binding pocket while two were
more distant from it, suggesting that excess mutual information can
indeed identify both nearby and allosteric residues affecting func—
tion. Only one of the four lowest—scoring residues displayed a >2—
fold reduction in cefotaxime antibiotic resistance (Fig. 6C).
Similarly, of the four mutants scoring near zero (background correl—
ation only), none showed a >2—fold decrease in drug resistance (Fig.
6C). These results demonstrate that excess mutual information can
robustly identify (P<0.05 via Fisher’s exact test or P<0.01 via
two—tailed Kolmogorv—Smirnov test) residues likely to be involved
in enzyme function and consequent drug resistance.

4 Discussion

We have developed an excess mutual information metric to predict
residues important for drug hydrolysis in the CTX—M9 beta lacta—
mase enzyme based on MD simulations. We initially developed ex—
cess positional mutual information to score protein residues on the
inﬂuenza hemagglutinin glycoprotein that inﬂuence low—affinity
binding of sialoglycans (Kasson et al., 2009). Here, we show how

Excess positional mutual information

 

excess mutual information can be used in a much more sensitive and
targeted fashion, detecting motions of an enzyme that are weakly
but significantly coupled to dynamics of a bound substrate, and pro—
spectively predicting and testing mutants that affect enzyme func—
tion. This marks a substantial expansion on the scope of problems
for which excess mutual information can predict mutational effects:
from initial work on relatively ‘ﬂoppy’ low—affinity ligand binding,
it was not obvious that mutual information would successfully pre—
dict sites of mutation in a relatively rigid beta—lactamase enzyme.
Although positional mutual information has been used very pro—
ductively to identify conformational substates of a protein, use of
excess mutual information allows a much more targeted measure—
ment of how individual residues are related to ligand motion in a
manner that is robust even in the presence of weak coupling. As we
have shown, excess mutual information identifies residues where
mutation alters km even though these residues are not strongly
related to ligand or binding—pocket motions in the full N2 symmetric
uncertainty matrix.

Our primary goal in developing excess mutual information is to
obtain a metric that can predict both binding—pocket mutations
and allosteric ones in a single integrated analysis. Since many
structure—based approaches concentrate on the ligand—binding
pocket, our prediction of both proximate and distant residues dem—
onstrates the power of such an approach. Another motivation for
the use of positional excess mutual information is that it provides
an empirical measurement of positional relatedness that can be
complementary to mutational analysis (Kasson et al., 2009) yet le—
verages state—of—the—art classical MD force fields for both force cal—
culation and sampling of statistical ensembles of conformations. In
contrast to methods that compute energy—based coupling of protein
residues, analyses of MD trajectories naturally incorporate en—
tropic terms and yield a free—energy—based coupling of protein resi—
due motions.

Our analysis identified several previously untested mutations
predicted to alter the catalytic activity and drug resistance conferred
by CT X—M9. We tested a set of these prospective predictions utiliz—
ing bacterial drug resistance as a measure of enzyme function, com—
paring to low—scoring mutations. The predicted high—scoring
mutations had a much greater effect on enzyme function than mid—
scoring or low—scoring controls (6/ 8 showing a >2—fold drop in re—
sistance versus 1/8 in the aggregate control groups; P < 0.01 via KS
test). Furthermore, these mutations that alter drug resistance are
located both within and outside the drug—binding pocket, with high—
scoring mutations as far as 24  away, meeting our design criteria
of a single global analysis to identify both local and allosteric mu—
tants. The ability to anticipate altered drug—resistance of new vari—
ants is of great utility for clinical surveillance of CTX—M beta
lactamases as well as drug development efforts.

Abstract

Motivation: The function of an RNA molecule is not only linked to its native structure, which is usu—
ally taken to be the ground state of its folding landscape, but also in many cases crucially depends
on the details of the folding pathways such as stable folding intermediates or the timing of the fold—
ing process itself. To model and understand these processes, it is necessary to go beyond ground
state structures. The study of rugged RNA folding landscapes holds the key to answer these ques—
tions. Efficient coarse—graining methods are required to reduce the intractany vast energy land—
scapes into condensed representations such as barrier trees or basin hopping graphs (BHG) that
convey an approximate but comprehensive picture of the folding kinetics. So far, exact and heuris—
tic coarse—graining methods have been mostly restricted to the pseudoknot—free secondary struc—
tures. Pseudoknots, which are common motifs and have been repeatedly hypothesized to play an
important role in guiding folding trajectories, were usually excluded.

Results: We generalize the BHG framework to include pseudoknotted RNA structures and system—
atically study the differences in predicted folding behavior depending on whether pseudoknotted
structures are allowed to occur as folding intermediates or not. We observe that RNAs with pseu—
doknotted ground state structures tend to have more pseudoknotted folding intermediates than
RNAs with pseudoknot—free ground state structures. The occurrence and influence of pseudoknot—
ted intermediates on the folding pathway, however, appear to depend very strongly on the individ—
ual RNAs so that no general rule can be inferred.

times, life times of meta—stable states and folding pathways.
Riboswitches that control transcription, for example, often function
through finely balanced time—scales of transcriptional elongation
and formation of a terminator hairpin structure (B3rrick 3nd
Breaker, 2007). These relevant kinetic parameters can in principle
be derived from the folding landscapes.

The most direct way of dealing with the ensemble aspect of an
RNA is to enumerate its entire energy landscape. In addition to the
list of conformations, the landscape picture emphasizes a notion of
adjacency between RNA structures. In most cases, opening or clos—
ing of a single base pair is taken to be the elementary operation, and
thus as the definition of adjacency between two structures (Fl3mm
et (11., 20003). The dynamics of folding is then modeled as a Markov
process of transitions between adjacent conformations with transi—
tion rates estimated from energy differences using, e.g. the
Metropolis rule (Fl3mm et (11., 20003; Smit et (11., 2007;
X3y3phoummine et (11., 2007).

Except for very short RNAs, this approach is not feasible in prac—
tice because the number of secondary structures grows exponentially
with sequence length (Hof3cker et (11., 1996). The dynamic program—
ming algorithms for finding the ground state or evaluating the parti—
tion function can be modified to enumerate only the lowest energy
states (Wuchty et (11., 1999). Even so, condensed representations are
required to gain insights into the properties of the energy landscapes
that are relevant for the definition of folding pathways and the inter—
pretation of folding kinetics. The first representation of this type is a
barrier tree with local minima as leafs and saddle points as interior
nodes. This notion has been developed independently in different
contexts including spin glasses (Klotz 3nd Kobe, 1994; Sib3ni et (11.,
1999), potential energy surfaces for protein folding (G3rstecki et (11.,
1999; Wales, 2011), molecular clusters (Doye et (11., 1999) and
RNA secondary structures (Fl3mm et (11., 20003). The kinetics on
the landscape can then be approximated by the Arrhenius law on
the barrier tree. However, this abstraction has significant shortcom—
ings. It completely neglects both the entropic information on the size
and the shape of the basin surrounding its corresponding local min—
imum (LM), and the topological information of their relative loca—
tions. Wolfinger et al. (2004) showed that much of the entropic
effects can be captured by partitioning the landscape into the basins
of LMs. This yields a barrier tree with energy scales in terms of ener—
gies of basins rather than structure energies. But, still the barrier tree
necessarily ignores the general topology of the landscape since in
most cases there are more than one folding pathways between RNA
structures.

Kuch3rik et al. (2014) introduced the basin hopping graph
(BHG) to capture more information regarding adjacency between
LMs. Nodes in the BHG are LMs, and two LMs are neighbored
only if the direct transition between their corresponding basins are
‘energetically favorable’. The corresponding saddle height is anno—
tated on the edge. In this abstraction, possible folding pathways are
represented as sequences of adjacent basins represented by their
LMs. The BHG is particularly suitable to describe the ruggedness of
RNA folding landscapes and to explain the interconversion between
multiple ‘active’ LMs as observed by Solom3tin et al. (2010). Like
barrier trees, BHGs can be obtained by complete enumeration for
small RNAs. Kuch3rik et al. (2014) also developed an efficient and
accurate heuristic that makes the approach feasible for RNA mol—
ecules with a length up to ~200 nucleotides (nt).

So far, these techniques are largely restricted to pseudoknot—free
secondary structures despite the fact that pseudoknots are crucial
for the function of many RNA elements, e.g. ribosomal frame—
shifting (Giedroc et (11., 2000), regulation of translation and splicing

(Dr3per et (11., 2000), or the binding of small molecules (Gilbert
et (11., 2008; Klein et (11., 2009; Spit3le et (11., 2009). Large RNAs
often feature long—range pseudoknots (Ad3ms et (11., 2004; Klein 3nd
Ferre—DAm3re, 2006; Toor et (11., 2008) that may play important
roles in both biochemical function and mechanical stability (Chen
et (11., 2009). Even though pseudoknots have been considered in the
contexts of folding pathways and kinetic mechanisms in particular
case studies (Cho et (11., 2009; Engel et (11., 2014; Is3mbert 3nd
Siggi3, 2000; Roc3 et (11., 2015), the energy landscapes of RNAs
with pseudoknots and other tertiary contacts have not received
much systematic attention. There are several reasons for this state of
affairs: (i) detailed thermodynamic and kinetic measurements on
pseudoknots are still rare despite recent progress (Liu et (11., 2010)
so that energy models for pseudoknotted RNAs are crude approxi—
mations at best; (ii) computational methods for sampling pseudo—
knotted structures are expensive in terms of both CPU time and
memory (Reidys, 2011) and (iii) there are many competing alterna—
tive definitions of the space of pseudoknotted structures ranging
from small extensions of pseudoknot—free structures to essentially
arbitrary matchings (Condon et (11., 2004; Lyngso 3nd Pedersen,
2000; Nebel 3nd Weinberg, 2012).

The contribution of this article is two—fold: First, we demonstrate
that the BHG can be computed in practice using the so—called
1—structures as its search space as described by the gfold (Reidys
et (11., 2011) algorithm and the work of Bon et al. (2008). To this
end, we propose an efficient sampling algorithm for detecting LMs
and we generalize the estimation of direct saddles to structures with
pseudoknots. We will see that the inclusion of pseudoknotted struc—
tures indeed leads to a significant reduction in saddle heights.
Second, we model the folding kinetics as a continuous—time Markov
chain on the BHG to investigate the effects of pseudoknotted LMs
on the folding kinetics. This contribution is organized as follows: In
Section 2.1, we generalize the existing BHG model by taking pseu—
doknotted structures into consideration. Next, in Section 2.2, we de—
scribe the continuous—time Markov chain simulation based on the
BHG and the quasi—steady—state (QSS) strategy utilized to reduce the
dimension of our model. In Section 3, we present and discuss our ex—
perimental results. Section 4 summarizes our findings and suggests
directions for future work.

2 Methods

2.1 BHG of pseudoknotted RNAs
We start with a brief, conceptual description of the BHG of an RNA
landscape. Complete formal definitions can be found in Part A of
the Supplement3ry m3teri3l (SM) and in our previous publication
(Kuch3rik et (11., 2014). Consider two LMs x and y and a path P
connecting them in the landscape. A structure of maximal energy
along P is called a peak. A saddle point between x and y is a peak
along a particular path from x to y with minimal possible energy.
We say that P is a direct path between x and y if P contains a peak 5
such that the energy is non—decreasing along P from x to s and non—
increasing from s to y. A direct path is energetically optimal if its
peak is a saddle point between x and y, i.e. if the direct path is an en—
ergetically optimal connection between x and y. The edges of the
BHG correspond exactly to these energetically optimal transitions.
A diagram to illustrate these concepts is provided in Supplement3ry
Figure S2.

In Kuch3rik et al. (2014), we described an efficient heuristic to
estimate the BHG for pseudoknot—free structures. It consists of
two independent components: (1) A sample set of LMs within a

user—defined energy range above the structure with minimum (free)
energy (MFE structure) is produced by simulating gradient walks
starting from randomly sampled structures. This step is implemented
in the program RNAlocmin. (2) Direct saddle connections between
LMs are constructed by a heuristic that iteratively improves initial
paths and expands the initial LM set by additional indispensable
intermediate LMs. Both construction procedures can be generalized
to structures with pseudoknots in a conceptually straightforward
manner. On the technical side, however, we encounter non—trivial
problems.

Since the inclusion of pseudoknots dramatically enlarges the
search space, exhaustive enumeration is not feasible in practice;
hence, we have to generalize RNAlocmin for pseudoknotted struc—
tures. RNAlocmin works by producing a Boltzmann—weighted sam—
ple of initial structures generated by stochastic backtracking. To our
best knowledge, the only tool that does Boltzmann sampling of
structures with pseudoknots is gfold (Reidys et (11., 2011). Its sam—
pling space is restricted to a class of pseudoknotted structures which
are characterized by the topological genus to be 1 as their ‘elemen—
tary’ components and therefore referred to as ‘1—structures’.
This class comprises the four basic types of pseudoknots shown in
Figure 1—the most common H—type and kissing hairpin (K—type) to—
gether with more exotic L—type and M—type pseudoknots. It includes
virtually all pseudoknot structures that have been discovered so far
(Bon et (11., 2008). The Boltzmann sampling from 1—structures is
computationally demanding. It takes 0(n6) time to computed the
partition function and then O(n5) time to sample a single structure
of length n. This first step is asymptotically optimal. The sampling
step could probably be expedited considerably e.g. using the bous—
trophedon method (Ponty, 2008). In practice, our current implemen—
tation is limited to an RNA of length ~130 nt. In SM Part B, we
summarized the technical adaptations that had been made to ensure
the consistency of the energy model within our BHG framework.

Gradient walks and connecting paths are also more difficult to
implement for pseudoknotted structures. The key issue is to deter—
mine whether the insertion of a base pair leads outside the class of
1—structures. The corresponding problem for secondary structures is
simple: it suffices to check whether the proposed extra base pair
crosses an existing base pair or not. For 1—structures, we construct
the conﬂict graphs whose vertices are the helices. An edge connects
two helices whenever they cross. For a 1—structure, its conﬂict graph
consists of isolated vertices and the four types of connected compo—
nents shown in Figure 1 bottom. Relatively simple manipulations of

conﬂict graphs can be used to decide efficiently whether a particular
base pair can be added. For details, we refer to SM Part B.

In order to determine the BHG—adjacency between LMs, we ex—
tended the findpath heuristic (Fl3mm et (11., 2000b) to compute
near optimal folding paths involving pseudoknotted structures.
Allowing pseudoknots should always result in lower or equal barrier
heights. However, since the accuracy of the findpath heuristic de—
creases as the landscape grows, its estimation results can in rare
cases be slightly worse than the original (pseudoknot—free) f ind—
path. We will return to this point in Section 3.1.

2.2 RNA folding kinetics

From a microscopic point of view, the dynamics on an RNA folding
landscape can be described by a continuous—time Markov process
with infinitesimal generator R : (ryx) (Fl3mm et (11., 20003). The
transition rate ryx from a secondary structure x to y is non—zero only
if x and y are adjacent, i.e. if they differ by adding/removing a single
base pair.
ryx : romin{exp{—(f(y) — f(x))/RT}, 1}, is used to assign micro—
scopic rates. Here, f evaluates the (free) energy of x, R is the univer—

Typically, the Metropolis rule,

sal gas constant, T is the absolute ambient temperature and m is a
parameter used to gauge the time axis from experimental data. Here
we simply use r0 : 1, implicitly defining our time unit. On the
BHG, we use the Arrhenius approximation. For two adjacent LMs x
and y with saddle height S (x, y) between them we set

 2 exp( — (sow) — f(y))/RT) . 11>

For all other pairs of LMs, rxy : 0. Kinetic trajectories are computed
by numerically computing the matrix exponential exp(tR). We have
shown already in previous work that the Arrhenius formula on BHG
is an excellent approximation of the dynamics on all time scales
(Kuch3rik et (11., 2014). Analogous validation data are given in SM
Part C.

The number of LMs in the energy landscape of randomly gener—
ated RNA sequences grows roughly as the square root of the total
number of structures (Lorenz 3nd Clote, 2011). Most of these LMs,
however, contribute only to fast ﬂuctuations because they have nar—
row basins and low barriers. We therefore adopt the QSS strategy
(R30 3nd Arkin, 2003; Schuster 3nd Schuster, 1989) to reduce our
model complexity. The key idea is to reduce the dimension of the
model by removing intermediate QSS and to update the transition
rates between the remaining states if correlated. To this end, one as—
sumes that population of a QSS remains unchanged over the time of
the simulation. In general, the a priori identification of QSS inter—
mediates is a hard problem. Here, however, we can simply use the
degree of LMs in the BHG: LMs with low degree are typically inter—
mediates of quick folding pathways between LM with primary func—
tion and their population stays extremely low during whole
simulation. Further technical details can be found in SM Part D.
Throughout this contribution, the state spaces of the examples are
pruned to at most 5000 LMs. For clarity, an LM is included in a
visualization only if its population exceeds 7% at some time during
the simulation.

3 Results and discussion
3.1 Pseudoknotted LMs’ role in folding

We first analyze the composition of the LMs in the ‘lower’ part of
the energy landscapes of RNA molecules, which we take here as
structures within 10kcal/mol above the minimal free energy of the

have both sensitivity and PPV beyond 80%, so that effects caused by
the prediction software can be limited. A statistic summary of the se—
lected RNAs is provided in Supplement3ry T3ble S2 Part E.

In Supplement3ry T3ble S3, we report the composition of the
LMs obtained by gradient walks starting from gfold—sampled
structures. Analogous result of these sampled structures is summar—
ized in Supplement3ry T3ble S4.

In our test set, LMs with pseudoknots occupy on average about
75% of LMs included in the BHG if the ground states contains pseu—
doknots. For RNAs with pseudoknot—free ground states, only about
35% of the nodes in the BHG contains pseudoknots. These data sug—
gest that pseudoknotted LMs can dominate the BHG only if the
ground state is also pseudoknotted. Furthermore, it follows from the
pseudoknot energy model of gfold (SM Part B) with its large penal—
ties for pseudoknots that a gradient walk starting from a pseudo—
knot—free structure cannot lead to a pseudoknotted LM. Gradient
walks starting from pseudoknotted structures preferrentially termin—
ate in pseudoknot—free or H—type pseudoknotted LMs due to the
even larger penalties assigned to the more complex pseudoknot
classes K, L and M.

General combinatorial arguments show that for n —> 00 almost all
structures contain pseudoknots (S3ule et al., 201 1). The energy model,
however, ensures that they are fairly rare among the stable structures
at the length scales of n z 100 . . . 300 nt that we can investigate com—
putationally and that are of most direct interest for experimental stud—
ies of RNA folding kinetics. Furthermore, folding is typically
dominated by local rearrangements, so that conclusions drawn for
moderate—size domains are likely to carry over to most transitions
along the folding pathways of very large RNAs. In other words, even
if pseudoknots appear almost certainly somewhere in long RNAs,
they are still sparse and most of the local folding at length scales of
around 100 nt is still dominated by pseudoknot—free structures.

A central question to ask is ‘What is the role of pseudoknotted
LMs in RNA folding pathwaysP’. One might expect that they help
decrease the saddle heights between structures. We therefore con—
sider, for an RNA whose ground state is pseudoknot—free the full
BHG‘I’ including pseudoknotted LMs and a pruned BHG“ in which
first all pseudoknotted LMs are removed from BHG‘I’ and then the
BHG—adjacency is recomputed using only pseudoknot—free struc—
tures along the paths. This re—evaluation may result in the removal
of adjacencies from BHG‘I’.

We illustrate in Figure 2 the saddle—height differences between
BHG‘I’ and BHG“ for two RNA molecules, a substrate for QB replic—
ases (SV11, 115 nt, pseudoknot—free native state—Biebricher 3nd
Luce, 1992) and an H—type pseudoknot forming a tRNA—like struc—
ture at the 3’end of RNA beta of barley stripe mosaic virus
(Pseudobase entry PKB_138, 96 nt). See SM Part F for additional ex—
amples. Note here, saddle heights between LMs in BHGU should
never be lower than in BHG‘I’. In practice, however, the inclusion of
additional LMs during the recomputation of the adjacencies can in
rare cases lead to a decrease in estimated saddle heights. In these
cases, the saddle heights in BHG‘I’ are overestimated due to the heur—
istic nature of the findpath method. The effect can be reduced by
a moderate increase of f indpath’s search depth (using the —depth
parameter), see SM Part F for further details.

We observe that pseudoknotted LMs help to reduce saddle
heights more significantly in the RNAs with pseudoknotted ground

states. This is a direct consequence of the large energy penalties asso—
ciated with pseudoknots, which makes is energetically expensive to
nucleate a pseudoknot directly from a pseudoknot—free structure
without certain detour. For PKB_138, these two types of pseudo—
knotted LMs help over 42% pairs of LMs to reduce their saddle
heights beyond 50%, or up to 12.3 kcal/mol in absolute terms.
In the case of SV11, the improvement is not that significant
(about 23% of pairs reduce their saddle heights beyond 10% up to
3.4 kcal/mol). Nevertheless, pseudoknotted LMs play an important
role in reducing the saddle height between the meta—stable and
ground state, see the more detailed discussion in Section 3.2.

We next study the effects of pseudoknotted LMs on the folding
kinetics. Here, we restrict ourselves to RNAs with pseudoknot—free
ground states since a direct comparison is not possible for pseudo—
knotted structures. Furthermore, we require that the native structures
are well predicted by gfold (both sensitivity and PPV beyond 80%).

We compare the times for the molecule to reach its thermo—
dynamic equilibrium in BHG‘I’ and BHGU, respectively. In most ex—
amples, the time to equilibrium is nearly the same. For example, the
folding kinetics of the Bacillus subtilis transcriptional riboswitch
preQ1 (36 nt) is shown in Figure 3 (left). In some cases, such as the
Escherichia coli rRNA fragment (94 nt) in Figure 3 (middle), we find
that pseudoknotted LMs significantly accelerate the folding kinetics.
This can be explained by the appearances of some lower energy re—
folding paths with pseudoknotted LMs. Finally, folding can be
slowed down when pseudoknotted kinetic traps appear in the land—
scape, as in the signal recognition particle RNA (Fig. 3, right).
Results for more RNAs are collected in SM Part G.

Since the BHG is built based on a sampling procedure, one might
be concerned about the robustness of our results. We therefore re—
peated each analysis 10 times starting from independent sampling
runs. As seen in Supplement3ry T3ble S5, saddle heights between
low—energy LMs vary little between runs. Therefore, we conclude

fairly stable.

3.2 A case study: SV11

The 115 nt SV11 RNA was discovered in in vitro selection experi—
ments as an excellent substrate for QB replicase (Biebricher 3nd
Luce, 1992). It features a nearly palindromic sequence with an ex—
tremely stable, hairpin—like ground—state structure which does not
contain any pseudoknot. Pulse—chase experiments showed that the
active conformation is a metastable structure formed during replica—
tion, while the ground—state structure (with energy —95 .9 kcal/mol)
does not serve as a template for the QB replicase. Melting experi—
ments indicated that the metastable structure (pseudoknot—free) with
energy —63.6 kcal/mol comprises two distinct stems (Biebricher 3nd
Luce, 1992). The energy difference between the ground state and the
metastable structure is 32.3 kcal/mol, well beyond the reach of ex—
haustive enumeration. In both BHG‘I’ and BHGU, the ground state is
correctly predicted as the MFE structure and the metastable struc—
ture is detected as an LM ranked as 47 478 in BHG‘I’ and 2466 in
BHG“ according to its free energy.

To further investigate the inﬂuence of pseudoknots on refolding
between the metastable and the MFE structure, we constructed and
compared optimal refolding paths in BHG‘I’ and BHGU . Even though
we considered only paths with a peak energy equal to the saddle
height and despite the coarse graining provided by the BHG, the
number of paths connecting the two minima remains very large.
Moreover, there is no common criterion to define which among
these paths is the ‘best’. We therefore employed two alternative cri—

with an upper time bound Tm as introduced by Perkins (2009).
Consider a trajectory U : (xo,to,x1,t1,  ,xk_1,tk_1,xk) where

state x,, i.e. x,- stays in state x,- for a time t,- and then transitions to

The optimal folding path according to Criterion A for BHG‘I’ is
shown in Figure 4 (bottom). This refolding path needs to pass
through 26 LMs and has a saddle height of —51.7kcal/mol. In con—
trast, the refolding path in BHGU shown Figure 4 (top) goes through
25 LMs with a slightly larger saddle height of —49.3 kcal/mol.

To illustrate the refolding paths more explicitly, we use the helix
representations introduced by Pseudoviewer (H3n et al., 2002).
In this representation, only the outermost base pair in each helix of
the structure is drawn with its terminated nucleotides indices anno—
tated. For example, the metastable structure of SV11 includes five
helices, denoted by 1719, 17?, 17:2, 1722 and 17550. The subscripts and
superscripts refer the start and end locations of the outermost base
pair of the corresponding helix. The helix hi9 embraces two other
helices 17%1 and log: to form a multi—loop. In the BHG‘I’, the refolding

Fig. 4. Folding energy profile of the optimized refolding paths of SV11 in
BHG” (top) and BHG‘l’ (bottom) from metastable state (Meta) to ground-state
structure (MFE) according to Criterion A, i.e. the path with the least peak and
accumulated energies. In which, only the LMs and saddles along the original
refolding paths are shown in the folding energy profile for the sake of clarity.
Helix representations of representative LMs and saddles are labeled along
the refolding path. These helix representations are drawn by Pseudoviewer
(Han et al., 2002). Only the outermost base pair in each helix of the structure
is drawn with its terminating nucleotide indices annotated (Color version of

path visits 10 K—type and four H—type pseudoknotted LMs. After a
K—type saddle structure S1 (—51.7kcal/mol), the molecule forms two
additional base pairs G28—C84 and C29—G83 in order to compen—
sate the energy cost of decomposing 1732. Subsequently, the decom—
position helices h§9 and 1734 in the H—type LM H1 leaves the rest of
the path pseudoknot—free. The pseudoknot—free refolding path in
BHG“ made some local adjustments inside helix h?” in order to
compensate the energy cost of decomposing helices h§9 and h526 in
S2 to form an intermediate ‘valley point’ N1 which pushed the re—
folding ﬂuctuation around its peak point.

For Criterion B, we consider two cases, with the upper time limit
set to either T: 0 and T : 1011 given that the actual refolding time

is around 1010. When T: 0, any t,- that an RNA molecule stays in a
particular state 5,- has to be 0 as well in order to maximize the likeli—
hood. An interesting observation is that in this case Criterion B is
equivalent to minimizing the accumulated activation energy. The
optimal path in BHG‘I’ and BHGU stays the same. It goes through a
total of 19 LMs with log—likelihood —154.00, accumulated activa—
tion energy is 94.91 kcal/mol, and peak energy —38.6 kcal/mol. This
optimal path does not go through any pseudoknotted LM.
Comparing to the optimal paths according to Criterion A (with log—
likelihood value —178.24 and accumulated activation energy
109.85 kcal/mol in BHG“; —191.44 and 118 kcal/mol in BHG‘I’), the
molecule is inclined to have the overall shape of the MFE structure
in a more ‘ambitious’ way rather than making detours through the
landscape for lowering down the peak energy. When T : 1011, the
optimal folding paths in BHG‘I’ and BHGU are the same. It goes
through 21 LMs with accumulated activation energy 109.85 kcal/
mol and all of the LMs are pseudoknot—free. Further details can be
found in SM Part H.

Finally, we compare the BHG‘I’—based folding kinetics simulation to
the simulation based on BHG“ . As shown in Figure 5, the BHG‘I’—based
simulation reached its equilibrium earlier than the BHGU case. The
metastable state is populated from around t : 103 to 1012 in the
BHGU—based simulation and from t: 10 to 1010 in the BHG‘I’ case. Our
simulation based on BHG‘I’ suggested that there exists another long—
lived metastable structure Meta_pk with a K—type pseudoknot.
Meta_pk has energy —64.0 kcal/mol and has nearly the same life time as
Meta (—63.6 kcal/mol). In particular, the period of time during which
the MFE structure gains population from the decay of Meta is
nearly the same as the case of Meta_pk. This is because Meta_pk
and Meta are separated by the same energy barrier from the MFE
structure.

4 Concluding remarks

We have demonstrated here that it is computationally feasible to com—
pute BHGs for secondary structures with a broad class of pseudo—
knots. The basin hopping graphs BHG‘I’ and BHGU are comparable
for RNAs with pseudoknot—free ground states. Therefore, they can be
used to investigate the effects of pseudoknots in the folding process.
We observe that for the majority of such RNAs the inclusion of pseu—
doknots makes little difference for the time to reach equilibrium.
However, there are RNAs where pseudoknots substantially speed up
the folding process by lowering the energy barrier. On the other hand,
pseudoknotted structures may also appear as kinetic trap states and
prevent efficient folding.

Our observations suggest that pseudoknotted structures should
be included in the analysis even when main states of an RNA switch
are pseudoknot free. Pseudoknots do, however, incur significant
computational cost, both because pseudoknot prediction methods
are expensive (0(n6) in case of gfold) and even more so, because
the size of landscape grows. Pseudoknotted folding intermediates
that lower the energy barrier are almost always H—type or K—type.
This suggests that the more complex L—type and M—type pseudo—
knots could be neglected, while the ability to predict kissing hair—
pins is essential for a realistic description of RNA folding
landscapes. Unfortunately, most current methods for pseudoknot
prediction focus solely on the prediction of ground—state structures,
while our approach requires the ability to sample structures
from the Boltzmann ensemble. Apart from this requirement,
any other method could be used as a drop—in replacement for
gfold.

and run until convergence to the thermodynamic equilibrium distribution.
Only LMs whose population probabilities reach 14.5% (BHGD) and 9% (BHG‘I)
are visualized for the sake of clarity. The state space of this simulation is
reduced to 10" LMs from 175733 LMs on BHG‘I (BHGD contains 8105 LMs, so
no further reduction is applied). The X- and y—axes indicate the time and popu-
lation probabilities, respectively. Dotted vertical line indicates when the simu-
lation reaches its equilibrium. The LMs that appear in both kinetics plots are
marked with same color, otherwise black. The only exceptional case is the
Metaipk, which is marked red for highlighting purposes. The sums of the

are marked with blue and red broken lines, respectively (Color version of this

Abstract

Motivation: Many drug combinations are routinely assessed to identify synergistic interactions in
the attempt to develop novel treatment strategies. Appropriate software is required to analyze the
results of these studies.

Results: We present Combenefit, new free software tool that enables the visualization, analysis
and quantification of drug combination effects in terms of synergy and/or antagonism. Data from
combinations assays can be processed using classical Synergy models (Loewe, Bliss, HSA), as
single experiments or in batch for High Throughput Screens. This user—friendly tool provides
laboratory scientists with an easy and systematic way to analyze their data. The companion pack—
age provides bioinformaticians with critical implementations of routines enabling the processing
of combination data.

Availability and Implementation: Combenefit is provided as a Matlab package but also as stand—

 

alone software for Windows (http://sourceforge.net/projects/combenefit/).

1 Introduction

The combination of drugs is an important strategy to treat various dis—
eases. The goal is to increase efficacy and, through the avoidance of
overlapping toxicity, improve the therapeutic index of treatment
(Long et (11., 2014). At the discovery stage, research often focuses on
the identification of synergistic target effects using in vitro systems
(Lehér et (11., 2009; Roemer and Boone, 2013; Sun et (11., 2013). Large
scale combination screens testing multiple pairwise combinations of
drugs across different concentration ranges and cell lines are being
performed with increasing frequency (He et (11., 2015; Held et (11.,
2013; Mathews Griner et (11., 2014). Typically, the dose—response
data generated during these experiments are then analyzed in terms of
synergistic or antagonistic effects. Free software were developed in the
past but these are limited in terms of data handling and available

options, particularly given high throughput screens (HTS) require—
ments (http://www.c0mb0syn.c0m/; Dressler et (11., 1999; Prichard
and Shipman, 1990). Two recent commercial software packages
offer advanced features such as automated analyses, choice from
a variety of models, quality curve—fitting, variety of graphical displays
and metrics quantification (Chalice http://cwr.horizondiscovery.c0m;
Genedata https://www.genedata.c0m). There is a lack of free,
advanced, scalable, software for the analysis of drug combinations. As
part of the growing effort in the search of effective combinations, we
present here Combenefit (‘Combinations Benefit’), a new software
tool that enables the visualization, analysis and quantification of drug
combination effects, in terms of synergy and/0r antagonism, for single
combination experiments but also HTS as per commercial packages
(Table 1).

2 General Overview (3) Combination experiment Single agent actlwty extraction and fitting

Combenefit implements a surface approach, where in vitro experimen—
tal data is compared to mathematical models of dose—responses for
non—synergistic combinations (also termed additive or independent
combinations; Greco and Bravo, 1995). The three classical models,
namely the Loewe (Loewe and Muchnick, 1926; Loewe, 1953), the
Bliss (Bliss, 1939; Webb, 1963) and the Highest Single Agent (HSA;
Mathews Griner et (11., 2014; Tan et (11., 2012) models have been incor—
porated. These models have been used extensively in the literature,
with different fields having their preference and sometimes alternative
names for these same models (Greco and Bravo, 1995; Odds, 2003). It
is important to use these models in a consistent way and to provide re—
sults in the context of the model used. Additionally, our own group is
currently developing a new general model which, together with any
other future feature, will be incorporated into Combenefit.

The approach implemented in Combenefit can be summarized as
follows (Fig. 1a). The experimental dose—response surface that de—
lineates combination effects in concentration space, is first read by
the software as a matrix of % of the control value across concentra—
tions. Single agent effects are extracted from this data and fitted
with a dose response curve. Based on the two single agent dose re—
sponse curves, a model—based combination dose—response surface is
derived. This surface provides a ‘reference’ dose—response surface
for a non—synergistic (additive/independent) combination, whose
characteristics are determined by the selected model (Loewe, Bliss,
etc.). The experimental combination dose response surface is then
compared to the model—generated one, resulting in a synergy distri—
bution in concentration space. This synergy distribution can be fur—
ther summarized via various metrics as described below.

3 Using Combenefit

The software is available as a standalone application for Windows
or as a Matlab package. The standalone application can be installed
automatically and is then directly accessed through its own icon.
The Matlab package needs to be saved in a dedicated folder which is
then accessed via Matlab by calling the Combeneﬁt routine con—
tained in the package. Laboratory scientists can quickly and easily
analyze their data using either version. Bioinformaticians can use
the code provided in the Matlab package to facilitate their own pro—
jects involving drugs combinations.

3.1 Typical analysis
A typical analysis is performed as follows. Upon completion of ex—
periments, the results of a specific combination (including replicates

drug in columns and the second in rows; a template is provided).
Once Combenefit is launched, the project folder containing all ex—
perimental .xls files is selected (Fig. 1b). Then, one or more reference
models can be selected. Other options and graphical outputs can be
chosen as per requirements/preferences. The graphical outputs con—
sist of: (i) the single agent dose response data and its fitting, (ii) the
combination dose response (Four different displays), (iii) the model—
generated reference combination dose response, i.e. the prediction of
effect if the drugs are not synergistic (Three different displays) and
(iv) the resulting synergy distribution (Three different displays).
Additionally, a fourth graphic mapping the synergy distribution
onto the dose—response surface can also be displayed to facilitate

interpretation. All figures, as well as corresponding data, fitting par—
ameters and synergy metrics (see below) can be saved in the project
folder. Figures are saved as high quality .png or .pdf files which can
be directly used in publications. A user’s guide with step—by—step
guidance for installing and running the software is available online.

3.2 Metrics and batch analysis

The analyses described above result in a synergy distribution for the
combination being processed. To facilitate comparison across ex—
periments, or for HTS applications, it is useful to summarize the re—
sulting synergy and/or antagonism distribution using one or more
metrics. Combenefit provides a set of metrics (or scores) which cap—
tures information about the synergy distribution. These include met—
rics such as the maximum synergy, the integrated and the weighted
integrated synergy and concentration value at which synergy is most
dense (for a full list of metrics and their formulation, please see the
Supplementary Material).

During HTS, large volumes of combinations and cell lines are
investigated using automated technology. Combenefit can be used
to analyze the large amount of data derived with these screens.
Using Combenefit, the user selects the folder containing all experi—
ments (each in an individual sub—folder) and then selects the ‘Batch
Analysis’ option. Upon running the analysis, Combenefit will batch
process in a sequential way all the folders. The results of the analysis
are summarized in a table containing all the experiments in rows
and the metrics in columns. Typically, the highest hits are then visu—
ally inspected using Combenefit’s graphical outputs to improve
understanding of the data and prioritize drug combinations.
Combenefit has been recently used to generate the AstraZeneca
dataset (~11 500 combinations) provided for the current
AstraZeneca—Sanger Drug Combination Prediction DREAM chal—
lenge (http://dreamchallenges.org/).

In summary, we have described the overall implementation and
functioning of Combenefit, new software which offers advanced
graphical capabilities and allows for model—based quantification of
drug combinations in single and high—throughput settings. We
hope that this new tool will continue to improve and will help
many scientists in a variety of fields involving combination data
analyses.

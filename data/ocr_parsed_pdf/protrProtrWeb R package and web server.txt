Abstract

Summary: Amino acid sequence—derived structural and physiochemical descriptors are extensively
utilized for the research of structural, functional, expression and interaction profiles of proteins and
peptides. We developed protr, a comprehensive R package for generating various numerical repre—
sentation schemes of proteins and peptides from amino acid sequence. The package calculates
eight descriptor groups composed of 22 types of commonly used descriptors that include about
22 700 descriptor values. It allows users to select amino acid properties from the AAindex database,
and use self—defined properties to construct customized descriptors. For proteochemometric mod—
eling, it calculates six types of scales—based descriptors derived by various dimensionality reduc—
tion methods. The protr package also integrates the functionality of similarity score computation
derived by protein sequence alignment and Gene Ontology semantic similarity measures within a
list of proteins, and calculates profile—based protein features based on position—specific scoring ma—
trix. We also developed ProtrWeb, a user—friendly web server for calculating descriptors presented
in the protr package.

Availability and implementation: The protr package is freely available from CRAN: http://cran.
r—project.0rg/package:protr, ProtrWeb, is freely available at http://pr0trweb.scbdd.c0m/.

1 Introduction

Protein sequence is the ultimate resource for functional protein
research. In order to apply various machine learning approaches on
protein sequence data, it is common practice to encode sequence
information as numerical features. The type of encoding, however,
can significantly affect analyses, and choosing a precise and effective
encoding is a critical step (Chou, 2011).

In hioinformatics, sequence-derived structural and physicochem-
ical features have been widely applied in the research of protein
structure and functions during the past two decades, such as, protein
structural and functional classes (Chou and Fasman, 2006), pro-
tein—protein interactions (Cao et (11., 2014; Shen et (11., 2007),

suhcellular locations and peptides of specific properties (Chou and
Shen, 2008), and post-translational modifications (Xu et (11., 2013).
In cheniogenomics, these structural and physicocheniical descriptors
are also routinely used to characterize target proteins in drug—target
pairs for potential drug—target interaction discovery (Cao et (11.,
2012, 2013a, b). In proteochemometric (PCM) modeling (Wikberg
et (11., 2004), continuous descriptors derived by various molecular
descriptor sets and dimensionality reduction methods (van Westen
et (11., 2013a, b) are successfully employed in several applications,
such as DNA binding pattern analysis, compound selection in lead
optimization (van Westen et (11., 2011), novel ligand discovery
(van Westen et (11., 2012), proteases ligand selectivity modeling

(Ain et al., 2014) and predicting resistance to pesticides for agro—
chemicals (van Westen et al., 2014).

Moreover, for protein and peptides, amino acid sequence and
annotation—based similarity scores derived from sequence align—
ments and Gene Ontology (GO) annotation comparison are also
useful representation schemes, which are widely used in modeling,
such as genome—wide inference of protein—protein interactions
(Zhang et al., 2012).

Several web servers and stand—alone programs, such as
PROFEAT (Li et al., 2006), PseAAC (Shen and Chou, 2008), propy
(Cao et al., 2013c) have been established to calculate such structural
and physicochemical descriptors. However, currently available solu—
tions are often limited to certain types of descriptors, lack flexibility
and usually difficult to seamlessly integrate into the predictive mod—
eling pipeline. We still urgently need a comprehensive and flexible
toolkit to calculate and customize these descriptors. Here, we intro—
duce protr and ProtrWeb, the R package and web server for calcu—
lating various numerical representation schemes of protein and
peptides from amino acid sequence. We recommend using protr to
represent the proteins or peptides under investigation. Besides, in the
context of systems biology, we hope that protr will be useful for
exploring the biological questions about structures, functions and
interactions of proteins and peptides.

2 Package description

The protr package calculates various commonly used structural and
physicochemical descriptors and PCMs modeling descriptors for
amino acid sequences. A list of descriptors for proteins covered by
protr is summarized in Table 1. These descriptors can be generally
divided into eight groups. The first group includes the amino acid
composition, dipeptide composition, tripeptide composition. The se—
cond group consists of three types of autocorrelation descriptors:
normalized Moreau—Broto autocorrelation, Moran autocorrelation

and Geary autocorrelation. The third group contains the CTD
(composition, transition, distribution) descriptors. The fourth group
consists of the conjoint triad descriptor. The fifth group contains
two sequence—order descriptor sets: sequence order coupling number
and quasi—sequence order descriptor. The sixth group includes
two types of pseudo—amino acid compositions (PseAAC):
pseudo—amino acid composition (Type I PseAAC) and amphiphilic
pseudo—amino acid composition (Type II PseAAC). The seventh
group contains seven types of descriptors used for PCM
modeling: including the scales—based descriptors derived by principal
components analysis, factor analysis and multidimensional
scaling, in combination with amino acid properties and 2D and 3D
molecular descriptor sets, and BLOSUM/PAM matrix—derived
descriptors. The eighth group calculates profile—based protein
features based on position—specific scoring matrix (PSSM) (Su et al.,
2006). For constructing customized descriptors of certain types,
protr supports defining user—specified properties and selecting prop—
erties from the AAindex database (Kawashima et al., 2008). See
the package vignette in the Supplementary data for computational
details of the descriptors, datasets and the full workflow
demonstration.

Similarity scores are another useful type of representation encod—
ing the relational information between two proteins. In protr, we
incorporated protein sequence alignment (Pages et al., 2014) and
GO semantic similarity measures computation (Yu et al., 2010) to
derive similarity scores. The parallelized version of functions for
computing the pairwise similarity scores are provided to accelerate
the computation speed.

Furthermore, protr provided several useful auxiliary functions,
such as functions for loading sequences from FASTA/PDB files,
batch downloading protein sequences from UniProt, amino acid
type sanity checking, partitioning sequences to create sliding win—
dows, etc. These functions make the tasks of protein sequence data
retrieval, pre—processing and manipulation easier in R. For users
without recourse to R scripting and requiring ad hoc analysis of

3 Results

To the best of our knowledge, protr is currently the most compre—
hensive, flexible and integrated open—source toolkit for protein se—
quence—derived structural and physiochemical descriptor
computation. Users can select appropriate descriptors calculated by
protr or ProtrWeb according to their needs, and conveniently apply
various statistical analysis and machine learning methods in R to
solve various biological questions concerning the structures, func—
tions and interactions of proteins and peptides.

Users of the protr package need to intelligently evaluate the
underlying details of the descriptors provided, instead of using protr
with their data blindly. It would be wise to use some negative and
positive control comparisons where relevant to help guide interpret—
ation of the results.

The protr package has been intensively tested to guarantee the
computation correctness and speed. To ensure that our calculation
is accurate, the calculated descriptor values were compared with the
known values for these sequences.

In future development of protr, it is a potential direction to in—
corporate 3D structural information of proteins (Grant et al., 2006),
which would be beneficial in several analysis and modeling
scenerios.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Probabilistic motif detection requires a multi-step
approach going from the actual de novo regulatory motif finding up
to a tedious assessment of the predicted motifs. MotifSuite, a user-
friendly web interface streamlines this analysis flow. Its core consists
of two post-processing procedures that allow prioritizing the motif
detection output. The tools offered by MotifSuite are built around the
well-established motif detection tool MotifSampler and can also be
used in combination with any other probabilistic motif detection tool.
Elaborate guidelines on each of its applications have been provided.

1 INTRODUCTION

Probabilistic methods, which search de novo for statistically
overrepresented motifs in co-regulated genes, have been proven
successful for the prediction of regulatory motifs. Due to
the presence of local optima in the search space of possible
overrepresented motifs, different initializations of a deterministic
algorithm, such as MEME (Bailey et (11., 2006) or different runs of a
stochastic algorithm, such as MotifSampler (Thijs et (11., 2002a) will
output non-identical motif predictions even when performed under
identical parameter settings. A tedious post-processing is required
to extract from this set of multiple candidate predictions, the most
signiﬁcant ones. MotifSuite streamlines this multi-step approach
from de novo motif detection to the assessment of motif signiﬁcance.

2 MOTIFSUITE

MotifSuite (Fig. 1) guides users through the procedure of
probabilistic motif detection. It consists of six different applications,
each with an own entry page where input ﬁles are uploaded and user
parameters are deﬁned. The applications can be used separately
or the whole analysis ﬂow can be run at once with consecutive
applications being compatible.

2.1 MotifSuite applications

A higher order background model (required for motif detection and
scanning) can be selected from our database (Marchal et (11., 2003) or
created with ‘CreateBackgroundModel’ (Thijs et (11., 2001). De n0v0
motif detection in co-regulated sequences is executed by multiple
Gibbs sampling runs in ‘MotifSampler’ (Thijs et (11., 2002a, b).
Compared with the previous release of MotifSampler, the current
release provides extensions that allow better approximating the true
number of motif instances in each sequence of a given sequence set.
Each of the multiple motifs reported by MotifSampler is represented
by a set of instances and is summarized by a position weight
matrix (PWM). Probabilistic motif detection offers the advantage
of prioritizing the most reliable motif predictions by performing
a signiﬁcance analysis on the combined output of multiple motif
detection runs. To this end, two applications are provided: (1)
‘MotifRanking’ sorts a list of predicted motifs (PWMs) by their
motif model score and groups together PWMs that represent the
same candidate motif. The representatives of each group (i.e. the
motif with the highest score in the group) are prioritized by their
motif model score and the number of times they re-occurred among
the multiple motif detection runs (i.e. only high scoring motifs that
are representatives of a large group of similar PWMs are retained);

and (2) ‘FuzzyClustering’ evaluates predicted motifs at their instance
instead of motif model level. Ensemble motifs obtained by merging
instances of multiple motif detection runs have been shown to
more accurately describe true motifs than any of the individual
motif solutions (Newberg et (11., 2007; Reddy et (11., 2007). In
FuzzyClustering, subsets of instances that were frequently detected
together in multiple motif detection runs are grouped together into
cluster(s) (J oshi et (11., 2008). A cluster represents an ensemble motif
from which spurious instance predictions have been removed and
in which instances are prioritized according to their membership
score. ‘MotifComparison’ computes the PWM similarity to curated
motif models from precompiled or user-supplied databases to
analyze whether detected motifs correspond to any known motifs.
Besides the original similarity metric (KL), the current release
of MotifComparison provides an alternative similarity metric [p-
BLiC, based on Habib et (11. (2008)] that assigns more importance
to similarity in motif positions that differ signiﬁcantly from the
genomic background assuming that such positions contribute most
to the sequence-speciﬁc binding of a motif. ‘MotifLocator’ uses the
PWM of a detected motif to screen (genome-wide) DNA sequences
for potential novel motif instances.

2.2 Optimal use

To encourage the user to fully exploit the potential of our
applications, we provide elaborated guidelines explaining the basic
design of each application, the impact of its parameters and how
to optimally evaluate its output. For most datasets, running our
applications in the default workﬂow and at default parameter settings
provides a reasonable answer. For particular datasets (e.g. with
a different number of instances in different sequences), tuning
parameter settings improves the detection of true motifs or at least
provides a more accurate description of the detected motif. We
provide elaborated case studies demonstrating the use of MotifSuite
on 43 Escherichia coli sets of co-regulated sequences containing
known motifs (Gama-Castro et (11., 2008). The MotifSampler case
study shows, for example, that using a non-default setting for
the expected number of instances per sequence (Statements 6
and 7) allows the detection of some motifs (four cases) that
were missed under default setting and provided a more accurate
prediction of the number of true instances for another set of
ﬁve motifs. Another example is the use of the p-BLiC metric in
MotifComparison instead of the default metric based on mutual
information (used in MotifRanking) to assess the similarity to
detected motifs (MotifRanking case study, Statement 2; Table 3a).

The case studies also show the complementarity between
MotifRanking and Fuzzyclustering in post-processing the results
of multiple MotifSampler runs. MotifRanking is best suitable
to quickly assess whether a dataset contains any signiﬁcantly
overrepresented motifs (MotifRanking case study, Statement 1),
whereas FuzzyClustering is better in retrieving the more reliable
instances of a detected motif (FuzzyClustering case study,
Statement 2). Alternatively, FuzzyClustering can be used to

summarize the results of running MotifSampler at different
parameter settings. Employing this scenario is, for example most
suitable to ﬁnd motifs having different unknown motif lengths
in different sequences (FuzzyClustering will report instances of
different lengths and build a single consensus PWM of most optimal
motif length).

3 DISCUSSION

Conclusively, MotifSuite replaces INCLUSive (Coessens et (11.,
2003; Thijs et (11., 2002b) which offered online access to the ﬁrst
release of MotifSampler. MotifSuite not only offers an improved
release of MotifSampler but also provides a set of complementary
methods for prioritizing and comparing motifs obtained by multiple
runs of the Gibbs sampling tool. Because of their modular
structure, the applications provided by MotifSuite can be used in
combination with any probabilistic motif detection tool other than
MotifSampler.

to the full protein corresponding to the query. In Jalal et a].
(2009), this problem was addressed by manually comparing the
annotations of the two proteins. However, this approach suffers
from the drawbacks described previously; thus, DAPPLE uses
the well—established reciprocal BLAST hits (RBH) method to
ascertain orthology (Overbeek et al., 1999). For a known site
X from organism A with match Y in target organism B, let X”
be the full protein corresponding to X, and analogously for Y”.
DAPPLE declares X” and Y” as orthologues if and only if Y” is
the best match when X” is used as a query and the proteome of
organism B is used as the database, and X” is the best match when
Y” is used as a query sequence and the proteome of organism A is
used as the database. In this case, ‘the best match’ is deﬁned as
any protein that has the smallest E—value. Soft masking of the
query sequences is used when searching full protein sequences as
suggested by Moreno—Hagelsieb and Latimer (2008).

DAPPLE outputs a table in which each row represents the
result of a BLAST search using, as a query, one of the known
sites in the phosphorylation site database. The table is in a tab—
delimited plain text format that can easily be manipulated or
imported into a spreadsheet program. This table contains
many columns designed to help the user decide on the accuracy
and usefulness of a given match; the following list describes most
of these (for the full list, see the Supplementary Materials).

0 Query accession, query description, query organism, query
sequence, query siteithe accession number, description, or—
ganism, amino acid sequence and phosphorylated residue
(e.g. Y482) of X”, respectively.

0 Hit site, hit accession, hit description, hit sequenceithe
same as above, except for Y” rather than X”.

0 Sequence differencesithe number of differences between all
of X (not just the portion that matched in the BLAST local
alignment) and Y.

0 Hit protein E—valueithe E—value of the match between X”
and Y” when X” is used as the query and B is used as the
database.

0 RBH?7‘yes’ or ‘no’, depending on whether X” and Y” are
RBH.

3 RESULTS

To test DAPPLE, phosphorylation sites in the cow (Bos taurus)
were identiﬁed, as was done by Jalal et a]. (2009). The ﬁles
described below were used as input to DAPPLE. The
PhosphoSitePlus database was downloaded, and contained
214 185 unique phosphorylation sites. The proteomes corres—
ponding to the target organism (cow) and the organisms repre—
sented in the PhosphoSitePlus database were downloaded from
UniProtKB.

Table 1 compares the results given by Jalal et a]. with those
produced by DAPPLE. Note that both the methodology and
input data used are not identical, so DAPPLE’s output is not
expected to be exactly the same. Nevertheless, the percentages of
known phosphorylation sites that had a given number of se—
quence differences with their best bovine BLAST match were
similar between the two approaches. For DAPPLE, the

Sequence differences % (Jalal et a1.) % (RBH) % (E-value)
0 50 27.6 32.9
1 13 14.3 17.2
2 7 9.0 11.0
3 4 6.2 7.7
4 1.5 4.3 5.5
5 0.4 3.0 3.9
6 0.6 1.9 2.6
7+ 0 1.4 2.0
No homology 22 32.2 17.1

 

Note: The ﬁrst column indicates the number of sequence differences between a
known site from PhosphoSitePlus and its best bovine match. The second column
indicates the percentage of known sites with the indicated number of sequence
differences in Jalal et a]. (2009). The ‘no homology” row indicates known sites for
which there was either no match in the bovine proteome, or the annotation of the
match differed from that of the query. The third column represents output from
DAPPLE, with the ‘no homology” row indicating that either the phosphorylation
site had no match in the bovine proteome, or that ‘RBH?” = ‘no” (see Section 2).
The fourth column is similar to the third, except instead of a site falling under the
‘No homology” row if ‘RBH?” = ‘no”, it does so if the hit protein E—value (see
Section 2) is >10‘5. The E—value method represents a less stringent method of
ascertaining homology (though not necessarily orthology).

percentage of peptides under the ‘no homology’ category differed
depending on the criterion for declaring two proteins as ortho—
logues (see Table 1 caption), with the RBH method being less
sensitive but more speciﬁc than the E—value method. Note that
the sites reported by DAPPLE are only predictions; further, the
functional signiﬁcance of a homologous site may differ in the
target organism, especially when the target is a distantly related
species.

Both the gain in efficiency using DAPPLE, and the value of
using RBH as opposed to comparing annotations, are illustrated
with examples in the Supplementary Materials.

4 CONCLUSION

DAPPLE improves on an already—successful method for predict—
ing phosphorylation sites for non—typical model species. Our lab
has used its output to help design peptide arrays containing tar—
gets of protein kinases (Houseman et al., 2002) for studying
honeybee, pig and chicken (our manuscripts in preparation),
and it should be applicable to many other organisms, as well
as other research problems related to protein phosphorylation.
Finally, DAPPLE is not limited to phosphorylation; it could
easily be applied to other post—translational modiﬁcations or to
any problem that involves f1nding homologous motifs.

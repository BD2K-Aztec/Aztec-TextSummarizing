Abstract

Summary: High—throughput omics datasets often contain technical replicates included to account
for technical sources of noise in the measurement process. Although summarizing these replicate
measurements by using robust averages may help to reduce the influence of noise on downstream
data analysis, the information on the variance across the replicate measurements is lost in the aver—
aging process and therefore typically disregarded in subsequent statistical analyses.

We introduce RepExplore, a web—service dedicated to exploit the information captured in the
technical replicate variance to provide more reliable and informative differential expression and
abundance statistics for omics datasets. The software builds on previously published statistical
methods, which have been applied successfully to biomedical omics data but are difficult to use
without prior experience in programming or scripting. RepExplore facilitates the analysis by pro—
viding a fully automated data processing and interactive ranking tables, whisker plot, heat map and

principal component analysis visualizations to interpret omics data and derived statistics.

1 Introduction

Technical noise is a common limitation in many high-throughput
biological experiments. Both mass spectrometry devices for prote-
omics and metabolomics profiling as well as gene and protein micro-
array platforms can only provide a limited reproducibility
(Albrethsen, 2007; Chen et (11., 2007). In combination with the bio-
logical variance observed across different omics samples under the
same condition, the technical variability can significantly aggravate
the statistical analysis of the data, increasing the risk for spurious
and misinterpreted results.

A common approach to reduce the influence of noise on the stat-
istical analysis of omics data is to use technical replicate measure-
ments, e.g. for mass spectrometry data collecting three technical
replicates per biological sample is a typical setting. During data pre-
processing the replicate measurements are summarized to average

values, by determining the mean, median or a trimmed mean, to re-
duce the influence of noise in downstream data analysis. However,
the variance across replicate measurements often differs significantly
between the biological samples and this data on measurement uncer-
tainty is not retained by the summarization and consequently not
considered in following statistical analyses.

Approaches to exploit technical variance information to improve
robustness and sensitivity in downstream data analyses have been
developed in recent years for differential expression analysis (Liu
et (11., 2006), principal component analysis (PCA; Sanguinetti et (11.,
2005) and differential pathway analysis (Glaab and Schneider,
2012). To enable users with limited or no programming experience
to benefit from these new techniques to propagate variance informa-
tion to downstream analyses, we have developed RepExplore, a
web-service to analyze proteomics and metabolomics data with

technical and biological replicates. The software takes advantage of
available replicate variance data to derive more robust and inform—
ative differential expression and abundance statistics, whisker plot
and PCA visualizations for omics data interpretation. All results,
including interactive ranking tables, 2D and 3D PCA visualizations,
bar charts and heat maps are generated automatically within few
minutes for a typical dataset.

2 Workflow and methods

Analyzing omics data with RepExplore requires only the upload of a
tab—delimited dataset containing both technical and biological repli—
cates (all parameter settings on the web—interface are optional). The
data is processed automatically and the results can be explored inter—
actively in the web—browser.

Input: The only input required for RepExplore is a pre—processed
proteomics or metabolomics dataset of log—scale intensity measure—
ments in tab—delimited format with labels for biological and tech—
nical replicates (example data can be downloaded or analyzed
directly on the main web—interface). Optionally, the user can choose
to include further normalization procedures, e.g. to ensure that all
samples have the same median value (using a median scaling nor—
malization) or to remove dependencies between the signal variance
and average signal intensity (using a variance—stabilizing normaliza—
tion, see Huber et al., 2002).

Processing: After submitting an analysis task, the data is pro—
cessed in the background and a temporary status page is loaded, re—
directing the user to the results page after a short waiting time
(typically up to a few minutes depending on the dataset size; for
large datasets with a limit of 100 MB the status page can be book—
marked). During the statistical data processing, information on
measurement uncertainty derived from the variance across technical
replicates is exploited using the probability of positive log ratio
(PPLR) statistic (Liu et al., 2006; Pearson et al., 2009) to score the
differential abundance/expression of biomolecules across the biolo—
gical conditions. This method takes both summarized point esti—
mates and variation across the replicates into account to obtain a
more robust ranking of biomolecules [for comparison, results on the
mean—summarized replicates are generated additionally by applying
the widely used empirical Bayes moderated t—statistic, here referred
to as eBayes (Smyth, 2004)]. Similarly, to generate PCA results, the
replicate variance data is extracted and used to reduce the influence
of noise on the PCA computation (see Sanguinetti et al., 2005).

Output: The main result of a submitted analysis is an interactive,
sortable ranking table, listing the PPLR and eBayes significance
scores and the fold—changes as effect size measure for each biomol—
ecule and allowing the user to generate whisker plots for all table
entries of interest. If the user has chosen to generate a PCA visualiza—
tion, a 2D plot of the first two principal components is shown, re—
vealing potential grouping patterns among the samples or
facilitating the recognition of outlier samples. Additionally, the user
can view a navigable 3D PCA visualization (Glaab et al., 2010) of
the first three principal components by using a VRML browser plu—
gin or an offline VRML—viewer (see Tutorial section on the web—
page). Finally, to investigate the separability of sample sub—groups a
web—based, interactive heat map visualization using average linkage
hierarchical clustering is provided for the top—ranked biomolecules
(Deu-Pons et al., 2014).

Methods and previous validation: In functional genomics data—
sets the measured signal for a biomolecule on logarithmic scale is
commonly assumed to have an approximate normal distribution

(Karpievitch et al., 2009; Sabatine et al., 2005; Sjogren et al., 2007)
and to depend on the mean expression/abundance level a, and the
between—replicate variance 2, for biological conditions indexed by i.
If the technical replicate variance 11,, for condition i and replicate / is
taken into account additionally and assumed to follow a normal dis—
tribution centered at zero, the measured signal 31,, can be modeled as
follows (Liu et 41., 2006):

3’27 NN(Hiv4i+Ui/) (1)

where the parameters a, and A, are to be determined. The PPLR ap—
proach estimates these parameters using a variational Expectation—
Maximization (EM) algorithm, modeling them as independent and
/l as shared across the biological conditions. The parameter esti—
mates are then used to calculate a differential expression/abundance
score, reflecting the PPLR between specified conditions in the input
data.

In the same spirit, to reduce the influence of technical noise in
PCA, a further dedicated approach has been developed to exploit
replicate variance information for PCA computation (Sanguinetti
et al., 2005 ). This method is derived from the interpretation of PCA
as the maximum likelihood solution of a probabilistic factor analysis
model (Tipping and Bishop, 1999) into which the technical variance
is integrated as an additional term (for the detailed derivation, see
Sanguinetti et al., 2005 ). Optimal model parameters are again esti—
mated using an iterative EM algorithm.

These statistical methods have previously been validated on
benchmark omics datasets, resulting in improved accuracy in iden—
tifying differential abundance patterns (Liu et al., 2006) and tighter
sample clusterings (Sanguinetti et al., 2005 ). In the Supplementary
Material, we use multiple proteomic and metabolomic datasets to
compare the results obtained from the PPLR method with the
eBayes approach, a modification of the classical t—statistic using an
empirical Bayes method to shrink the estimated sample variances to—
wards a pooled estimate, providing a more stable inference for small
numbers of samples (Smyth, 2004). As a final supplemental analysis,
we compare the PPLR results obtained for different numbers of tech—
nical replicates on simulated data, showing that the ranking statis—
tics improve with increasing numbers of replicates.

3 Results

To illustrate RepExplore’s features and the results obtainable on
typical experimental data, we have applied the software to a metab—
olomics dataset comparing wild—type samples from the plant
Arabidopsis thaliana against the mutant maple phosphatase 1
(mkpl), which is more resistant to bacterial infection
(Anderson et al., 2014, see datasets overview in the Supplementary
Material).

As shown in the whisker plot in Figure 1a, for the top—ranked
metabolite identified using a standard eBayes analysis with mean—
summarized intensities (L—valine) the overlap of the value ranges for
the technical replicates across the two sample groups covers the
complete value range of the wild—type samples (only the summarized
intensity values are non—overlapping and would suggest a significant
difference in the metabolite abundance between the groups). By con—
trast, for the top—ranked metabolite according to the PPLR score
(L—proline), the value ranges of the technical replicates do not display
any overlap across the sample groups and the overall replicate vari—
ance is significantly smaller (see Fig. 1b). Thus, the whisker plots
reveal that the evidence for the induction of L—proline is more
reliable than for L—valine, highlighting the benefit of accounting for

Ranking tables of metabolites comparing the PPLR and eBayes
statistics, heat map visualizations of the metabolite abundance dif—
ferences between the knockdown and wild—type samples, and further
whisker plots for this and other datasets are provided in the
Supplementary Materials. The same metabolomics and proteomics
example datasets can also be analyzed in an automated fashion on
the RepExplore web—application, which enables an interactive ex—
ploration of the results (ranking tables are sortable and support the
generation of whisker plots for chosen metabolites; the 3D PCA
plots provides zoom, pan and rotate functionality, and meta—
information is displayed when clicking on a chosen column/row
entry in a heat map or on a data point in the 3D plots).

In summary, RepExplore interlinks the automated application of
statistical analyses exploiting technical replicate variance informa—
tion with web—based features to facilitate data exploration via inter—
active ranking tables and visualizations of the differential
expression/abundance patterns. In addition to the public web—
application, an exposed programmatic web—service API can be used
to control the software, enabling an efficient analysis of multiple
large—scale omics datasets.

Statistical data processing and analysis methods were all imple—
mented in the R statistical programming language. The web—applica—

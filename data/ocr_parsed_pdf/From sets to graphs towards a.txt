ABSTRACT

Motivation: Current gene set enrichment approaches do not
take interactions and associations between set members into
account. Mutual activation and inhibition causing positive and
negative correlation among set members are thus neglected. As a
consequence, inconsistent regulations and contextless expression
changes are reported and, thus, the biological interpretation of the
result is impeded.

Results: We analyzed established gene set enrichment methods
and their result sets in a large-scale investigation of 1000 expression
datasets. The reported statistically significant gene sets exhibit only
average consistency between the observed patterns of differential
expression and known regulatory interactions. We present Gene
Graph Enrichment Analysis (GGEA) to detect consistently and
coherently enriched gene sets, based on prior knowledge derived
from directed gene regulatory networks. Firstly, GGEA improves
the concordance of pairwise regulation with individual expression
changes in respective pairs of regulating and regulated genes,
compared with set enrichment methods. Secondly, GGEA yields
result sets where a large fraction of relevant expression changes
can be explained by nearby regulators, such as transcription factors,
again improving on set-based methods. Thirdly, we demonstrate
in additional case studies that GGEA can be applied to human
regulatory pathways, where it sensitively detects very specific
regulation processes, which are altered in tumors of the central
nervous system. GGEA significantly increases the detection of gene
sets where measured positively or negatively correlated expression
patterns coincide with directed inducing or repressing relationships,
thus facilitating further interpretation of gene expression data.
Availability: The method and accompanying visualization
capabilities have been bundled into an R package and tied to
a grahical user interface, the Galaxy workflow environment, that is
running as a web server.

1 INTRODUCTION

Transcriptomic studies measure gene expression in different
conditions. Striking genes, which are differentially regulated
between the conditions, are of primary interest and investigated for
common features and membership in group of genes, which have
the same function or belong to the same biochemical pathway.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

A ﬁrst impression of similar behavior of genes can be achieved
via Clustering of genes (Eisen et (11., 1998). The usually more
effective overrepresentation analysis (ORA) tests the overlap of a
predeﬁned group of genes and the set of differentially expressed
genes assuming the hypergeometrical distribution under the null
hypothesis (Breitling et (11., 2004). The method is widely accepted
and has been subject to modiﬁcations of diverse visual and model
related features (see Khatri and Draghici, 2005, for an overview),
though the basic statistical principle remained unchanged. However,
Goeman and Buhlmann (2007) criticize that the sampling procedure
of ORA is statistically invalid and leads to a hazardous interpretation
of the resulting P-value. Furthermore, the concentration on the
usually small group of signiﬁcantly differentially expressed genes,
compared with the set of all the other, usually thousands of genes
analysed in the study that are ignored, is not suitable for an
investigation on a global scale.

Both points of criticism are resolved in Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis (GSEA) as it uses a valid sampling procedure and computes
over the whole scope of genes (Subramanian et (11., 2005). A
Kolmogorov—Smirnov test statistic is applied to test whether the
ranks of the P-values of the genes in the gene set can be a sample
from a uniform distribution. Several modiﬁcations of GSEA have
been published (see Dinu et (11., 2009, for an overview).

Though ORA and GSEA are convenient in the analysis of genes
that are independently expressed, a serious problem arises when
these methods are applied to gene set deﬁnitions extracted from
regulatory networks and metabolic pathways. The assumption of
independence among set members does not hold anymore; genes
are found to be correlated due to mechanisms of co-regulation and
co-expression. Initial steps to deal with that problem include implicit
accounting for the correlation structure (e. g. Barry et (11 ., 2005) and
integration of network topology of undirected interaction networks
(e.g. Ulitsky and Shamir, 2007). Based on these ﬁrst efforts, Liu
et (11. (2007) have proposed Gene Network Enrichment Analysis
(GNEA) that uses ORA to test for overrepresentation of gene sets
in transcriptionally affected subnetworks of a global interaction
network.

As the sign of gene expression Changes and the direction of
regulatory interactions are so far not taken into account, substantial
features of the data are still ignored and the dynamics of the
transcriptomic system are not realistically reﬂected. Activation and
inhibition are essential regulatory mechanisms in the transcriptional
machinery of the cell and are causes for up- and down-regulation
of particular genes. Although processes like post-translational
modiﬁcation and combinatorial effects between regulatory proteins

impair a straightforward causal relationship between regulation
and gene expression, it was shown that coexpression is correlated
with ﬁinctional relationships between genes (Lee et al., 2004).
Additionally, integrative analysis of transcriptome, proteome
and interactome data revealed signiﬁcant correlations between
expression proﬁles and regulatory interaction on the protein
level (Ge et al., 2001; Jansen et al., 2002). Hence, we explain
positive correlation in gene expression with activating edges of
the transcriptional network. Vice versa, we assume inhibition to
cause observed anti-correlation in gene expression patterns. In our
following deﬁnition of Gene Graph Enrichment Analysis (GGEA),
we exploit both ﬁindamental regulation types in a novel enrichment
framework for signed and directed gene regulatory networks, to
judge whether the topology of the network is well ﬁtted by the
expression data.

2 METHODS
2.1 GGEA

Given gene regulatory information. for example extracted from biochemical
pathways or a global transcriptional network. a gene set under investigation
and gene expression data sampling different conditions. GGEA performs
three essential steps (Fig. 1): ﬁrst. the gene set is mapped onto the underlying
regulatory network. yielding an induced subnetwork. That is the affected part
of the network. which consists of edges that involve members of the gene
set. Second. each edge of the induced network is scored for consistency
with the expression data. i.e. the signs of the expression changes of two
interaction partners are evaluated for agreement with the regulation type
(activation/inhibition) of the link that connects both genes. Third. the edge
consistencies are summed up over the induced network. normalized and
estimated for signiﬁcance using a permuation procedure.

Experimental setup: in the following. we consider the classical setup of a
transcriptomic study. This incorporates a set G of usually several thousand
genes g, (i=1,...,rt) measured for differential expression between two
conditions. each represented by a group of samples S1={s1,...,sk} and
S2 = {.sk+1 , . . . , s,,,}. respectively. The function

expr:G><(S1US2)—>R (1)

returns the expression value for a gene and a sample at a time.

Measures ofa'iﬁ‘erential expression: the most intuitive measure for expression
changes of a single gene between two conditions is the fold change

deﬁned as the ratio of the estimated expression values of a particular gene
in both sample groups

where expr(g, S) computes the mean expression level of gene g in condition S.
We compute t-test derived P-Values to assess the statistical signiﬁcance of
the expression changes (Pan. 2002) and correct them for multiple testing.
Both measures are log transformed

fcz=log2<fct ﬁ:=—logm(p>, <4)

and the signiﬁcance thresholds at: —log(0.05) and 13:1 (2-fold) are used
as defaults for p and fc. respectively. Such sharp thresholds are of course
quite artiﬁcial and discriminate drastically between genes just over and just
below a or 13. In addition. noise in the data. such as imprecise and erroneous
measurements of gene expression values. has to be expected and to be dealt
with. Hence. we divide the range of both measures into two main categories
and smooth the borders Via introduction of a degree of uncertainty. according

Fig. 3. Modelling regulatory interactions using PNFL. Shown is a KEGG
style representation of an activation and its transformation into a PNFL

effect type of the GRN.

Induced gene regulatory networks: enrichment analysis is the determination
of signiﬁcant gene sets out of a predeﬁned universe of gene sets U . s.t. result
sets accumulate differentially expressed features of the gene expression data.
GGEA uses an a priori deﬁned gene regulatory network (GRN). typically
extracted from respective databases or compiled from the relevant literature.
to introduce and exploit the interdependencies between gene set members.
We model a regulatory interaction of the GRN as a transition t (Fig. 3) with
an input place for the regulator and an output place for its target. as well as an
associated effect (activation. inhibition) and the direction of the interaction.
For a gene set u e U . we construct the induced subnetwork

GRN(u) :2 {z eGRN | uﬂ(in(t)Uout(t)) 75a}, (9)

st. for each gene g of the gene set u all transitions are extracted. where g is
either the regulating or the regulated gene.

GRNs as Petri Nets: Petri net (PN) models are well established in information
theory (see Murata. 1989. for a review) and have been extensively applied to
biochemical processes. like metabolic pathways (e.g. Kuffner et al.. 2000)
and gene regulatory networks (reviewed in Chaouiya. 2007). Given a GRN
under investigation. we construct a corresponding PN having features of
fuzzy logic (FL). as it is introduced as PNFL in Kuffner et al. (2010).
and illustrated in Figure 3. The regulations of the GRN are required to
be speciﬁed with direction and effect. In our model. regulator (R) and
regulated target (RT) are represented Via PN places holding tokens of fuzzy
values for both fold change (fc) and signiﬁcance of fc (sig). The variety
of regulatory effects occuring in the GRN are deﬁned by speciﬁc fuzzy
rules rege {f+,f_,f+_,f7, ...} (Table 1). meaning activation f+. inhibition f_
and dual effects f+_. The concept is extendable. e.g. to other effects like
interactions of unknown type f). The fuzzy rules compute output tokens
from given input tokens. Thus. consistency between expected (i.e. modeled)
behaviour and the measured values can be evaluated. Consistency takes the
direction of the effect. the amount (fc) and its signiﬁcance into account and
is a straightforward extension of the discrete notion of consistency (e.g. R
up and f+ => RT up). Moreover. it appropriately models noise in the actual
experimental measurements.

Consistency of regulatory interactions: the major problem of set enrichment
strategies. when applied to GRN-based gene sets. is that they accumulate
evidence for differential expression of single genes to estimate the
enrichment of the whole set. Interfering and potentially contrary constraints
of the underlying GRN are ignored. For example. two signiﬁcantly up-
regulated genes increase the enrichment of the set. even if one gene inhibits
the other. For that reason. we introduce the concept of consistency.

DEFINITION (consistency): a transition of a PNFL is consistent with given
expression data. if the measured and the modeled expression of the

regulated gene is in agreement. The modeled expression is estimated from
the regulatory effect and the expression of the regulator.

Intuitively. consistency for the special case of a simple activating or inhibiting
edge requires fold changes for regulator and target of the same or opposite
directions. respectively. It is implied for the above example that an up-
regulated inhibitor should result in reduced expression of the affected
gene.

For the PN constructed above. a consistent transition t with fuzzy
regulation function f, between an input place i and an output place 0 satisﬁes

i.e. the modeled predicted expression behaviour agrees with the actual
observed behaviour.

Scoring: to determine if and to which extent t is consistent with the given
expression data. we calculate the consistency

C(t):=cons(de0, ,(de,)), (11)

where the function cons estimates the (fuzzy) similarity between the
predicted and measured token on the output place of transition t. Consistency
computation is generic. an example implementation of cons incorporates
defuzzyﬁcation of the fuzzy values back into real numerical values (Kuffner
et al.. 2010) and taking their reciprocal absolute difference. We compute the
raw GGEA consistency score S for the subnetwork GRN(u). induced by the
gene set u e U . Via summation over the consistencies of all transitions T“ of

to adjust for the size of GRN(u).

Signiﬁcance ana1 ranking: according to the recommendations of Goeman
and Buhlmann (2007) and Gatti et al. (2010). statistical signiﬁcance of the
consistency score is estimated Via a permutation approach based on subject
sampling. which is deﬁned in a self-contained way:

(1) Permute group assignment of samples N times.

(2) Recalculate differential expression measures for each permutation.
(3) Recalculate consistency score for each permutation.

(4) Find the consistency P-Value as the proportion of permutation scores

that are larger than the observed score.

We compute the consistency P-Value for each gene set ue U and rank the
gene sets by the adjusted P-Values. i.e. P-Values corrected for multiple
testing (see again Fig. 1). Gene sets below the chosen signiﬁcance niveau
are classiﬁed as signiﬁcantly ana1 consistently enriched.

Extensions: to apply to regulation processes involving multiple regulators
and transcription complexes composed of several genes. we allow a transition

Implementation and availability: GGEA is implemented in the statistical
language R (Ihaka and Gentleman. 1996) and makes use of the
Bioconduc tor software suite (Gentleman et al.. 2004). The GGEA
method and accompanying Visualization capabilities have been bundled into
an R package and tied to a grahical user interface. the Galaxy workﬂow
environment (Goecks et al.. 2010). that is running as a web server.

2.2 Consistency and explainability study setup

Data sampling ana1 network construction: gene expression data of
Escherichia coli was collected and sampled from the M3D database (Many
Microbe Microarrays Database. Faith et al.. 2008). The 1000 datasets were
designed in a two-class fashion. s.t. each class contained 15 samples. It
was assured that real-world distributions of fold changes and differential
expression P-Values were matched. A global gene regulatory network for
E.coli was constructed using the regulatory interactions provided in the
RegulonDB database (Gama-Castro et al.. 2008). From the union of all
stored TF/gene. TF/operon. TF/TF. (7/ gene and ct/TU regulatory interactions
(TF stands for transcription factor. TU for transcriptional unit and 0' for the
RNA polymerase o-factor). we removed duplicated and ambiguous edges.
The ﬁnal network connected 2097 unique nodes by 5784 edges. which were
clearly annotated as either activating or inhibiting.

Methods collection and gene set deﬁnitions: for each dataset. we applied the
standard hypergeometrical overrepresentation test ORAl. and a collection of
array resampling methods that correctly control false positive rates and gene
correlation patterns (Gatti et al.. 2010). These are the modiﬁed resampling
overrepresentation test ORA2 (Goeman and Buhlmann. 2007). SAFE (Barry
et al.. 2005). GSEA (Subramanian et al.. 2005) and SAM-GS (Dinu et al..
2009). The gene set catalogue for analysis was deﬁned on the one hand
according to the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway
annotation (Ogata et al.. 1999) for E.coli. and. on the other hand. according
to the gene ontology (GO) classiﬁcations (Ashburner et al.. 2000) of E.coli.
We restricted both catalogues to gene sets having at minimum 5 and at
maximum 500 set members. This yielded 83 and 446 gene sets for KEGG
and GO. respectively.

Consistency benchmark: for each method. we collected for all datasets
with statistical signiﬁcant outcome (P<0.05) the top ranked gene sets.
As not all datasets produced signiﬁcant outcome for all methods. we
uniformly chose 700 sets at random from these top ranked gene sets
and computed the percentage of consistent relations in the corresponding
induced regulatory networks. We took regulation direction. type and strength
into account and distinguished respective categories. Activating relations
required both interaction partners to be expressed in the same direction to
be consistent. while inhibiting relations required them to be expressed in
the opposite direction. Regulation strength was categorized as weak and
strong. depending on the differential expression P-Value of the regulator. We
chose 0.5 and 0.05 as the thresholds for the weak and the strong category.

respectively. To estimate the null distribution in each category. we computed
the consistency of all gene sets in all datasets.

Explainability benchmark: the selected 700 top ranked sets were restricted
to differentially expressed genes of high statistical signiﬁcance. The
signiﬁcance niveau was set to 0.1. Minimum spanning trees (MST) were
computed for each of the reduced gene sets according to the underlying
global GRN. s.t. each signiﬁcant gene of a top ranked set could be reached
by all other signiﬁcant members of that set. Moreover. the corresponding
MST for such a set minimized the number of genes not contained in
the set. The direction of the regulatory link between two genes in the
network (activation/inhibition) as well as the direction of the expression
change of individual genes (down-/up-regulation) was ignored. We classiﬁed
a restricted result set as fully explainable if all members were directly
connected to another member in the corresponding MST. Otherwise. we
counted the number x of genes in the MST. which were not a member of
the set. and classiﬁed the set as explainable with x additional genes. As a
measure of explainability achieved by a method in all its 700 top ranked
sets. we calculated. for a chosen number x. the percentage of sets that were
explainable with at most x additional genes.

2.3 Case study setup

FiDePa ana1 local GGEA: we applied GGEA to the glioma dataset that
has been investigated before with the method FiDePa (Keller et al.. 2009).
The method exploits GSEA ﬁrst to determine differentially regulated paths
of a particular length and uses the resulting paths for the construction of
a consensus network. which is subsequently tested for overrepresentation
of gene sets. In a similiar approach. we computed consistency scores of
regulatory links in all human non-metabolic KEGG pathways (gene regulatory
and signalling pathways) and the 10 edges with the highest consistency
score were extracted from each of them. Duplicated edges were removed
and the consensus graph was further reduced Via application of a high pass
consistency ﬁlter using the mean consistency score as threshold. That yielded
a total of 378 edges connecting 342 unique nodes. which were tested. as in
FiDePa. for overrepresentation.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Consistency study

We conducted a meta-analysis of 1000 E. coli datasets and evaluated
the consistency within results of gene set enrichment methods, based
on the regulatory interactions found in the transcriptional network
of E.coli. Details of the study setup, the consistency benchmark
and the Classiﬁcation of interaction strength as weak and strong are
described in Section 2. The results for KEGG gene sets are shown
in Figure 4(a—d) and for GO gene sets in Figure 4(e—h).

We observe that the set enrichment methods systematically
neglect mutual regulation among set members. For KEGG gene sets,
weak regulations [Fig. 4a (activations), Fig. 4b (inhibitions)] are
only slightly more consistent than average (the null consistency)
and the gene set with maximal consistency is frequently not
reported by the set enrichment methods, regardless of activatory
or inhibitory links. Strong activators, with an expression change of
high statistical signiﬁcance, and the effects on their targets are more
consistently aligned (Fig. 40). However, the consistency gained in
strong activations is lost for strong inhibitions (Fig. 4d). The results
for KEGG sets are nearly replicated in GO gene sets (Fig. 4e—h). In
contrast, GGEA, which takes consistency into account for selecting
relevant gene sets in the ﬁrst place, yields the most consistent gene
sets in all categories for both, KEGG and GO gene set deﬁnitions.
Activations and inhibitions are similarin consistent, if adjusted

were collected and investigated for consistency of weak and strong activation and inhibition (as described in Section 2). GGEA results are displayed in red.
The plots show which fraction (x-axis) of the identiﬁed gene sets had at most a consistency of y%. The y-axis shows the consistency of sets as the fraction of

to background distributions of both regulation types, and stronger
signals are properly weighted in order to preserve the regulation
kinetics. Although stronger signals have an higher impact on the
GGEA score, weak regulations are also highly consistent in the sets
found by GGEA. In general, these ﬁndings are more pronounced
for GO sets, compared with KEGG gene set deﬁnitions. This is due
to the fact that the GO catalogue (446 gene sets) is nearly six times
larger and contains more diverse composed gene sets than the KEGG
catalogue (83 gene sets), which emphasizes differences between the
set and graph enrichment methods.

3.2 Explainability study

As the consistency is substantially incorporated in the GGEA score,
we performed a second evaluation using the more independent
benchmark of explainability, as described in Section 2. The main
target of this investigation was to determine to which extent
statistical signiﬁcant expression changes of single genes can be
explained by other set members. Considering that a statistical
signiﬁcant ﬁnding for a gene set indicates differential regulation
of the corresponding biological process, it is in turn implied
that a part of the global regulatory network (here a subgraph of
RegulonDB) exists, which connects the differentially expressed
genes in this set. However, it is frequently observed that important
regulators or mediators are missing in a particular gene set, leaving
its differentially expressed genes not connected with each other.
As a result, the biological interpretation of the observed effect is
impeded. Based on these considerations, we have introduced above
the terms fully explainable and explainable with x additional genes,
to assess how easily a result set can be interpreted. Intuitively,
the less additional genes needed, the easier the interpretation: a
single additional gene could possibly be a regulator or mediator
not contained in the set, while the need of several additional
genes requires more complex assumptions to make the outcome
interpretable. For the explainabilty study, we explicitly made
the input regulatory network undirected, generalizing the edges,

s.t. possibly unknown inverse regulations are allowed. We enhanced
this feature by additionally removing the sign of the fold change and
only judged whether a gene was differentially expressed or not. The
results are shown in Figure 5.

GGEA systematically reports more easily explainable sets than all
other methods for both, KEGG and GO gene set deﬁnitons. Similar to
the results of the consistency study, the gap is much bigger between
the performance of GGEA and the other methods when using GO sets
deﬁnitions, as also observed in the consistency study. For example,
GGEA needs in 73% of its top ranked gene sets a single additional
gene to make the differentially expressed genes in a particular set
connected, whereas the best set enrichment method, ORA1, can
explain only 42% of the sets with a single addition gene (SAFE:
35%, GSEA: 34%, ORA2: 32%, SAMGS: 29%). Allowing two
additional genes, GGEA can explain >90% of all reported gene sets,
while all other methods produce results 360%.

3.3 Case study

In a ﬁnal case study, we investigated two expression datasets of
human neuronal tumours and compared results of GGEA and set
enrichment strategies. Though a comparative benchmark is hard to
ﬁnd, due to a missing gold standard that classiﬁes detected pathways
as right or wrong in the context of the investigated expression data,
we approached this matter via collection of biological evidence in the
scientiﬁc literature and focussed on the speciﬁcity of the ﬁndings and
the sensitivity of the method used. For consistency evaluation, we
used the regulatory interactions occuring in human non-metabolic
KEGG pathways (gene regulatory and signalling pathways). In the
ﬁrst analysis, we applied GGEA to the glioma dataset that was
investigated before by Keller et al. (2009) with the method FiDePa
(see Section 2 for details). We observe large agreement in the result
lists of both methods (Table 2); 17 pathways listed in the FiDePa
result also occur in the top 25 of the GGEA ranking. The positive
control Glioma is better ranked (and has higher signiﬁcance) by
GGEA. Further, several unspeciﬁc and disease unrelated pathways

Fig. 5. Explainability of expression changes in top ranked sets. The 700 top
ranked gene sets (introduced in the consistency study above) of each method
were restricted to genes with expression changes of statistical signiﬁcance.
For each restricted set. we computed the minimal number of genes not in
the set. but needed to connect the signiﬁcantly regulated genes of that set.
to a regulation network. Displayed is the percentage of gene sets. for which
x or less additional genes are needed. E.g. for GO sets (Fig. 5a). a single
additional gene makes 73% of GGEA’s top ranked sets explainable. while
in case of ORAl or SAMGS a single gene makes only 42 or 29% of the
top ranked sets. corresponding to each method. explainable. The results are
similar for KEGG sets (Fig. 5b).

are discarded by GGEA and replaced by speciﬁc, cancer-related
pathways (e.g. renal cell carcinoma, endometrial cancer). For the
top rank, GGEA (Pathways in Cancer; not detected by FiDePa)
gives a clear disease-related hint, while FiDePa (MAPK signalling
pathway) reports a general signalling process. The Neurotrophin
signalling pathway, which promotes neuronal tumors via modulation
of neuronal apoptosis (Miller and Kaplan, 2001) is not identiﬁed by
FiDePa, but listed by GGEA on rank 4.

In the second evaluation study, we used neuroblastoma expression
data that was investigated for enrichment of metabolic pathways
before (Schrarnm et al., 2010). The application of GGEA to the
neuroblastoma dataset identiﬁed 17 signiﬁcantly and consistently
enriched pathways (Table 3). Best ranked is the neurotrophin
signalling pathway, which was already detected in the glioma
study to play an essential role in the development of neuronal
tumors. As this pathway seemed to be particularly striking for
both tumors, we determined regulations with highest consistency
in that pathway, in order to get a deeper insight into the disease-
causing dynamics: we found that the high afﬁnity nerve growth
factor receptor, which in humans is encoded by the NTRKl gene,
is up-regulated in neuroblastoma cells and activates the adaptor

protein SH2B3, the growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2),
the Abelson murine leukaemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (ABLl),
the phospholipase gamma 2 (PLCG2) and the SHC-transforming
protein 1 (SHC1). A literature search revealed that all the activated
and associated proteins are proliferating, oncogenic and/or apoptosis
inﬂuencing and thus, of cancer promoting importance (e.g. Borrello
et al., 1994; Ohmichi et al., 1991). In addition, the up-regulation
of the whole NTRKl proliferation module in neuroblastoma
was experimentally validated (Evangelopoulos et al., 2004) some
years ago. This sensitive ﬁnding motivated a similar investigation
for the other pathways in Table 3, which we identiﬁed to be
throughout substantially involved in neuroblastoma formation. As
an example: GGEA detects the Chemokine signalling pathway. We
found that neuroblastoma impairs Chemokine-mediated dendritic
cell migration (Walker et al., 2006) and chemokines strongly
promote neuroblastoma primary tumour and metastatic growth
(Meier et al., 2007).

Moreover, we wanted to know whether the ﬁndings of GGEA
are in concordance with the results for metabolic pathways. As
a showcase, we demonstrate this via the detected Fc epsilon RI
signalling pathway. In Schramm et al. (2010), only moderate
attention (discussed in their supplement) is paid to the extremely
signiﬁcant ﬁndings for phosphatidylinositol metabolism (P=9e-
12) and for several pathways concerning the metabolism of
lipids and fatty acids, e.g. fatty acid metabolism (P: 1.7e-9)
and glycerophospholipid metabolism (P: 3.9e-7), which are listed
in Table 1 of that publication. As it can be veriﬁed in the
corresponding KEGG pathway maps, Fc epsilon RI signalling has
a regulatory impact on both—the Phosphatidylinositol metabolism
via modulation of the phospholipase (affected by the neurotrophin
pathway) and the metabolism of lipids in general via stimulation
of arachidonic acid synthesis. Arachidonic acid is a polyunsaturated
fatty acid that is required for membrane phospholipid synthesis. It is
also involved in cellular signalling and known to activate syntaxin-3,
which causes cell membrane expansion of neuronal cells (Darios and
Davletov, 2006). Schramm et al. explain the several revealed signals
in lipid-related metabolisms with TCA-based energy production; the
GGEA results, explaining stimulation of arachidonic acid synthesis,
imply that the observed activated production of fatty acids and
lipids (which is based on the latter) is rather due to the increased
requirement of neuronal membrane material (i.e. speciﬁc lipids) in
the fast growing and dividing neuroblastoma cells.

4 DISCUSSION

In this work, we presented Gene Graph Enrichment Analysis
(GGEA), a novel algorithmic framework to detect increased
agreement between positively and negatively correlated expression
patterns of genes, connected by activating and inhibiting edges in
signed and directed transcriptional networks. The method exploits
directed regulatory relations represented as fuzzy logic rules to
assess and identify graphs, which maximize the consistency between
the regulatory network and the expression data. GGEA is a major
improvement to current gene set enrichment strategies, as we found
experimentally validated regulatory interactions not to be consistent
per se with the expression data in top ranked and statistically
signiﬁcant result sets of these methods. That was validated in
a large-scale consistency study of 1000 E.coli chips using the
E.coli RegulonDB, currently the best curated regulatory network,

for the investigation of consistency. As set enrichment strategies
ignore mutual regulation among set members, we observed that
activations and inhibitions are only average consistent with the
gene expression in these result sets. Even strong causal signals,
i.e. a regulator with differential expression of high statistical
signiﬁcance, in pairwise directed regulations were frequently not
properly reﬂected. Inhibitions were more seriously neglected than
activations. This is partly due to a data bias, as there are more
activations than inhibitions in the database. Hence, more genes, and
thus also more signiﬁcant genes, are involved in activations just by
chance. As gene set enrichment analysis mainly computes upon the
leading edge of the ranked P-value vector of genewise differential
expression (see Subramanian et al., 2005), gene sets with a majority
of activating genes are more likely to be reported. On the other
hand, we found activitations clearly better conserved than inhibitions
across all experiments stored in the M3D database. For GGEA, we
observed, under consideration of this bias, that activations were
nearly optimally consistent and inhibitions were preserved in a large
fraction of regulations. GGEA achieved the highest concordance
between the regulation direction and the expression behaviour of
the incorporated regulator and regulated target gene. It should be
emphasized that GGEA consistently aligned weak (only moderately
differentially expressed) signals, which are usually not taken into
account by set enrichment methods. That improved sensitivity
enables preference of weak, but coherent regulations over strong,
but contextless signals. This is expected to better reﬂect the nature
of key cellular regulators.

As GGEA exploits the consistency for the computation of its
score, we additionally carried out a more independent benchmark
to investigate how well statistically signiﬁcant expression changes
of single genes can be explained by other set members. As a
measure of explainability, we used the number of additional genes,
which were needed to connect signiﬁcant members of a set to a
regulatory network. We found this evaluation of particular interest,
as it tries to approximate the process of the human interpretation.
For all set enrichment methods, only a small amount of genes
could be explained by other set members in a signiﬁcant result
and we observed frequently that several additional genes were
needed. Implied is that set enrichment indeed indicates that there
is something striking happening in a certain result set; however,
conclusions whether observed expression changes are coherent and
in context with the surrounding regulators cannot be drawn. This is
resolved by GGEA. It systematically reports more easily explainable
sets than all other methods, and the fraction of explainable sets with
a single additional gene is increased by over 30% in comparison
with the best set enrichment method.

Furthermore, we applied GGEA in two pilot case studies of
human neuronal tumours using regulatory interactions of signalling
pathways, though incorporated protein—protein regulations cannot
be measured at the transcriptional level. Nonetheless, we again
hypothesize that genes, annotated to be associated in a pathway,
should show higher correlation patterns than arbitrary genes, which
are not. On the other hand, we argue that signal cascades normally
target altered gene regulation.

On the glioma dataset, GGEA discovered throughout speciﬁc
and disease-related pathways. Induced by increasing speciﬁcity, the
fraction of false positives decreases. Unspeciﬁc and inconsistent
pathways are replaced by more appropriate pathways. An example is
the detection of the neurotrophin signalling pathway that modulates

neuronal apoptosis (a very speciﬁc ﬁnding), while general apoptosis
is downgraded.

The Neurotrophin signalling pathway also has a major inﬂuence
on the development of neuroblastoma, another neuronal tumour
type. The experimentally veriﬁed connection was detected by GGEA
with high signiﬁcance, while GSEA failed to detect it. The discovery
of such false negatives of the set enrichment analysis is due to
improved sensitivity already observed in the consistency study.
However, it is surprising that only GGEA is sensitive enough
to detect the neurotrophin signalling pathway, the chemokine
signalling pathway and the Fc epsilon RI signalling pathway—all of
which have been shown to be of crucial importance in neuroblastoma
formation—while standard GSEA does not detect them. Best ranked
pathways of GSEA are as follows: cell cycle, ribosom and olfactory
transduction. The connection to the disease is incomprehensible and
explanations are almost arbitrary.

5 CONCLUSON

We showed in three independent and differently designed studies
that GGEA consistently aligns regulation and expression and yields
result sets where statistically signiﬁcant expression changes can be
explained by regulators within the set. Moreover, GGEA eases the
biological interpretation of reported gene sets, as they are more
coherent than sets reported by set enrichment methods. This means
many more of their relevant genes are connected or can be connected
by a minimum number of additional factors. In summary, our new
method GGEA is an intuitive enrichment method, which uses gene
regulatory information to improve consistency and coherence of
detected enriched gene sets and, thus, substantially reduces the
fraction of false positive and false negative classiﬁcations of relevant
gene sets. GGEA signiﬁcantly improves the detection of gene
sets where measured positively or negatively correlated expression
patterns coincide with directed inducing or repressing relationships
between the respective pairs of genes. Hence, gene set regulators,
such as transcription factors, can explain a signiﬁcant portion of
the observed expression changes. As GGEA is as fast and easy
to apply to experimental data as state-of—the-art set enrichment
analysis methods, it provides an alternative for interpreting gene
expression measurements and for deriving ﬁrst insights into the
relevant processes. The advantages of GGEA will increase in the
ﬁiture with the availabilty of better GRNs and better models for
regulatory relations in these GRNs.

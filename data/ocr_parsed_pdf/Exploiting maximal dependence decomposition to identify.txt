ABSTRACT

Summary: Bioinformatics research often requires conservative
analyses of a group of sequences associated with a specific
biological function (e.g. transcription factor binding sites, micro
RNA target sites or protein post-translational modification sites).
Due to the difficulty in exploring conserved motifs on a large-
scale sequence data involved with various signals, a new method,
MDDLogo, is developed. MDDLogo applies maximal dependence
decomposition (MDD) to cluster a group of aligned signal sequences
into subgroups containing statistically significant motifs. In order
to extract motifs that contain a conserved biochemical property of
amino acids in protein sequences, the set of 20 amino acids is
further categorized according to their physicochemical properties,
e.g. hydrophobicity, charge or molecular size. MDDLogo has been
demonstrated to accurately identify the kinase-specific substrate
motifs in 1221 human phosphorylation sites associated with seven
well-known kinase families from Phospho.ELM. Moreover, in a set
of plant phosphorylation data-lacking kinase information, MDDLogo
has been applied to help in the investigation of substrate motifs
of potential kinases and in the improvement of the identification of
plant phosphorylation sites with various substrate specificities. In
this study, MDDLogo is comparable with another well-known motif
discover tool, Motif-X.

1 INTRODUCTION

The conservative analysis of a group of sequences associated with
a speciﬁc biological function such as the investigation of protein
post-translational modiﬁcation (PTM) sites, analysis of micro RNA
(miRNA) target sites, or the identiﬁcation of transcription factor
binding sites is often required in bioinformatics research. Sequence
logos were ﬁrst proposed by Tom Schneider and Mike Stephens in
1990 to display patterns in sequence conservation, and to assist in
discovering and analyzing such patterns (Schneider and Stephens,
1990). In 2004, a web-based sequence logo generator, WebLogo,
was developed for creating graphical representations of the patterns
within a multiple sequence alignment (Crooks et (11., 2004). Several

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

extensions of sequence logo have also been developed, e.g. RNA
structure logos (Gorodkin et (11., 1997), PSSM logos (Fujii et (11.,
2004), energy normalized sequence logos (Workman et (11., 2005),
subfamily logos (Beitz, 2006), 3D sequence logos of DNA or
RNA (Bindewald et (11., 2006) and RNA structural alignment
logos (Chang et (11., 2008). In the case of functionally associated
sequence patterns (e.g. protein phosphorylation sites), Two Sample
Logo (Vacic et (11., 2006) has been developed for generating
graphical representations of statistically signiﬁcant position-speciﬁc
differences in amino acid compositions between phosphorylated
sequences and non-phosphorylated sequences. With regard to motif
discovery, a wealth of popular approaches have been proposed, such
as MEME (Bailey and Elkan, 1994), TEIRESIAS (Rigoutsos and
Floratos, 1998), Gibbs motif sampler (Thompson et (11., 2003) and
eMOTIF (Nevill-Manning et (11., 1998). Additionally, an iterative
statistical approach, Motif-X (Schwartz and Gygi, 2005), has been
proposed for identifying motifs from large-scale datasets. Motif-X
has demonstrated results that outperform other methods based on
the identiﬁcation of phosphorylation motifs.

According to the basic concept of sequence conservation, a
sequence logo displays the nucleotide or amino acid composition for
each position in a group of aligned signal sequences. However, it is
difﬁcult to explore conserved motifs for large-scale sequence data;
for instance, a sequence logo for all phosphorylation data involved
with various catalytic kinases fails to obviously present the kinase-
speciﬁc substrate speciﬁcity. Thus, a new method is developed,
MDDLogo, which applies maximal dependence decomposition
(MDD) to Cluster a group of aligned signal sequences into subgroups
containing statistically signiﬁcant motifs. Assuming that each
position in a set of aligned sequences is a sample of symbols
(nucleotides or amino acids) generated according to a probability
distribution, a null hypothesis is based on the assumption that the
symbol distribution of two positions are mutually independent.
MDD is a recursive methodology that adopts the Chi-square test
to capture the most signiﬁcant dependencies between each position.
In a previous study (Burge and Karlin, 1997), MDD was proposed to
group the splice sites during the identiﬁcation process of splice-site
prediction.

In order to extract motifs containing conserved biochemical
properties of amino acids in protein sequences, the set of 20 amino
acids is further categorized according to their physicochemical
properties, e.g. hydrophobicity, Charge or molecular size. After
MDD Clustering, each subgroup, containing statistically signiﬁcant
motifs, is graphically visualized using WebLogo (Crooks et (11.,
2004). With the exponential increase of protein PTM sites identiﬁed

Maximal dependence decomposition

 

by mass spectrometry, there is a motivation to further understand
modiﬁcation sites by studying its surrounding motifs. A case
study done on 1221 human phosphorylation sites associated
with seven well-known kinase groups has been used to test the
effectiveness of MDDLogo. In addition, MDDLogo has been
utilized to investigate known and novel substrate motifs of catalytic
kinases in plant phosphorylation data. The identiﬁed motifs are
used for the computational identiﬁcation of plant phosphorylation
sites with various substrate speciﬁcities. Based on a 5-fold
cross-validation evaluation, predictive models trained with MDD-
Clustered subgroups show improvement with its prediction accuracy
as compared with those models trained without the application
of MDD Clustering. This method, in addition to identifying the
conserved motifs of identiﬁed and as yet unidentiﬁed kinases and
ﬁinctional domains, may also eventually be used as a tool to
determine potential substrate speciﬁcity in proteins of interest.

2 METHODS

2.1 Maximal dependence decomposition

Due to the difﬁculty of detecting the conserved motifs for a large-scale
sequence data. a new program. MDDLogo. is developed. MDDLogo applies
MDD to cluster all sequences into subgroups that have statistically signiﬁcant
motifs. MDD was initially proposed to group splice sites during the
identiﬁcation process in splice site prediction (Burge and Karlin. 1997).
Huang et al. (2005a. b) have incorporated MDD to identify kinase-speciﬁc
phosphorylation sites; MDD is a recursive methodology which groups a
set of aligned signal sequences in order to subdivide a large group into
subgroups that capture the most signiﬁcant dependencies between each
position. Figure 1 presents the analytical ﬂowchart of MDD clustering; in
addition. a tree-like View of MDD clustering on plant phosphoserine (pSer)
sequences is given in Supplementary Figure S1. An amino acid sequence is
used as a sample for MDD clustering instead of a nucleotide sequence.

As shown in Figure 1. fragments of amino acids are extracted from
plant pSer sequences using a window of length 2n+1 that is centered on
pSer sites. Since n is set to 10. the position Ai is selected from the range
of 710 to +10. Then. a contingency table of the amino acids occurrence
between two positionsAi and Aj is constructed. In order to extract motifs that
have conserved biochemical property of amino acids when doing MDD. the
twenty 20 types of amino acids is categorized into ﬁve groups: neutral. acid.
basic. aromatic. and imino groups. as shown in Supplementary Table S1 (see
Supplementary Materials). MDDLogo provides several grouping methods.
as well as MDD clustering without the grouping of twenty 20 amino acids.
Next. chi-square test X2(A,»,Aj) is adopted to evaluate the dependence of
amino acid occurrence between two positions A,» and A,- surrounding the pSer
sites. Assuming that each position in a set of aligned sequences is a sample of
symbols (nucleotides or amino acids) generated according to the probability
distribution. a null hypothesis is based on the assumption that the symbol
distributions of two positions are mutually independent. The chi-square test
is deﬁned as:

2 5 5 (eri _ mn)2

where X,,,,, represents the number of sequences that have the amino acids of
group In in position A,» and have the amino acids of group n in position Aj. for
each pair (A,. A1) with i #j. E,,,,, is calculated as  . where XmR =X,,,1 +
---+X,,,5.XC,, 2X1” + - - - +X5,,. andX denotes the total number of sequences.
The two positionsA,» andAj are considered as dependent when their X2(A,» ,A,-)
value is larger than K. Herein. the value of K is 34.3. corresponding to a cutoff
level ofoz = 0.005 with (5 — 1) X (5 — 1): 16 degrees of freedom (Burge and

The position. A,». with a maximal dependence value of Score(A,») is applied
to cluster sequences. which is based on the amino acid group containing
maximal chi-square value in position Ai. According to the distribution of
amino acids in position A,». the sequences containing an amino acid group
with the maximal chi-square value are clustered into a subgroup. and the
remaining sequences are clustered into another subgroup. MDD clustering
is a recursive process that divides all sequences into tree-like subgroups.
When applying MDD to cluster sequences. a parameter. i.e. the maximum
cluster size. should be set. If the size of a subgroup is less than the cutoff
value of maximum cluster size. the subgroup will not be divided any further.
The MDD process terminates after all of the subgroup sizes are less than the
value of the speciﬁed maximum cluster size. After MDD clustering. each
subgroup is graphically Visualized using WebLogo (Crooks at al.. 2004)
which generates the entropy plot of sequence logo. The conservation of
sequences in each subgroup can then be easily examined.

Supplementary Figure S1 presents an example of MDD clustering on a
set of Arabidopsis Thaliana phosphoserine (pSer) sequences collected from
the TAIR database (Huala at al.. 2001). Using all 2506 experimental pSer
sequences. it can be observed that position +1 has the maximal dependence
value with a statistically signiﬁcant occurrence of imino amino acid.

i.e. proline (P); Thus, all of the data can be divided into two subgroups:
one subgroup (624 sequences) having the occurrence of imino amino acids
in position +1 and the other subgroup (1882 sequences) not having the
occurrence of imino amino acids in position +1. Because the value of
maximum cluster size is set to 500, these two subgroups would be further
clustered. In the left-hand tree, the subgroup of 624 sequences is further
divided into two subgroups: one subgroup (236 sequences) having the
occurrence of basic amino acids in position —3 and the other (388 sequences)
which does not have the occurrence of basic amino acids in position —3.
After this, further division of subgroups using MDD clustering is terminated
in the left-hand tree because the data size of the resulting subgroups is now
less than 500 sequences. With regard to the right-hand tree, the subgroup of
1882 sequences is further divided into two subgroups: one subgroup (786
sequences) having the occurrence of acid amino acids in position +3 and the
other subgroup (1096 sequences) which does not have the occurrence of acid
amino acids in position +3. The resulting subgroups in the right-hand tree
contain over 500 sequences; thus, it is further clustered using MDD. Finally,
the recursive MDD clustering is terminated when each subgroup in the leaf
node has less than 500 sequences.

2.2 Construction of proﬁle hidden Markov model

In this work, proﬁle hidden Markov model (HMM) is applied to learn a
predictive model from the sequences of each optimized MDD-clustered
subgroup. An HMM describes a probability distribution over a potentially
inﬁnite number of sequences (Eddy, 1998). It can be used to detect distant
relationships between amino acids sequences. Here, we use the software
package HMMER version 2.3.2 (Eddy, 1998) to build the proﬁle HMMs, to
calibrate the HMMs and to search the putative functional sites against the
protein sequences. HMM builds a model based on the positive instances of a
class; thus, in this study, only positive data were considered to build a model.
In the case of protein ubiquitylation sites, the MDD-clustered subgroups of
all ubiquitylation data are taken as training sets to learn the HMMs. One
HMM is built for each MDD-clustered subgroup.

For each model of the MDD-clustered subgroups, a threshold parameter
is selected as a cutoff value in identifying potential positive data from a
query (Eddy, 1998). Next, in order to search the hits of a HMM, HMMER
returns both a bit score and an expectation value (E-Value). The bit score is
the base two logarithm of the ratio between the probability that the query
sequence is a signiﬁcant match and the probability that it is generated by a
random model. The E-Value represents the expected number of sequences
with a score greater than or equal to the returned HMMER bit scores. A
search with the HMMER bit score greater than the threshold parameter is
taken as a positive prediction. While decreasing the bit score threshold favors
ﬁnding true positives, increasing the bit score threshold favors ﬁnding true
negatives.

2.3 Performance evaluation of predictive models

The predictive performance of the constructed models is evaluated by
performing k-fold cross-validation (Ron, 1995). The original data are divided
into k subgroups by splitting each dataset into k approximately equal sized
subgroups. In each round of the cross-validation process, a subgroup is
regarded as the test set, and the remaining k—1 subgroups are regarded
as the training set. The cross-validation process is repeated k rounds, with
each of k subgroups used as the test set in turn. Then, the k results are
combined to produce a single estimation. The advantage of k-fold cross-
Validation is that all original data are regarded as both training set and
test set, and that each data is used for test exactly once (Chen et al.,
2010). In this study, the value of k is set to 5. Next, the following
measures of predictive performance of the trained models are calculated:
Precision (Pre)=TP/(TP+FP), Sensitivity (Sn)=TP/(TP+FN), Speciﬁcity
(Sp) =TN/(TN + FP), and Accuracy (Acc) = (TP + TN)/(TP+ FP + TN + FN),
where TP, TN, FP and FN denote the number of true positives, true negatives,

false positives and false negatives, respectively. Along with a 5-fold cross-
Validation evaluation, different values for the HMMER bit score were also
tested in order to obtain the optimal threshold parameter for predicting
query sequences. The HMMER bit score from the range of —10 to 0 was
each tested as in order to obtain the best threshold value for each MDD-
clustered subgroup. The performance of the models learned by HMMER
given different threshold values of bit score is then compared.

3 UTILITY OF MDDLOGO

3.1 Identiﬁcation of kinase-speciﬁc motifs in human
phosphorylation sites

Protein phosphorylation catalyzed by kinases plays crucial
regulatory roles in intracellular signal transduction (Hubbard and
Cohen, 1993). Manning et al. (2002) have identiﬁed 518 human
kinase genes, the so-called ‘kinome’, that provides a starting
point for comprehensive analysis of kinase-speciﬁc substrate site
speciﬁcity. Although mass spectrometry-based proteomics have
enabled the increasing number of in viva phosphorylation sites
(Aebersold and Mann, 2003), only about 20% phosphorylation
sites have the annotation of catalytic kinases (Lee et al., 2011).
In order to frilly investigate how protein kinases regulate the
intracellular processes, it is necessary to accurately identify the
substrate speciﬁcity of various kinases. This case study applies
MDDLogo to identify the kinase-speciﬁc motifs for a large-scale
data of protein phosphorylation sites in humans. A total of 1221
human phosphorylation sites involved with seven kinase groups are
extracted from Phospho.ELM (Diella et al., 2008). Supplementary
Table S2 shows the 232, 89, 280, 248, 226, 241 and 67 human
phosphorylation sites for PKA, PKB, PKC, MAPK, CDC2, CK2
and ATM kinase groups, respectively, as well as their substrate-
site motifs. Fragments of amino acids are extracted from 1221
phosphorylation sites using 11mer window length which is centered
on phosphorylation sites.

Supplementary Figure S2 presents the user interface as well as
the MDD-clustered results of 1221 human phosphorylation sites. As
the grouping of amino acids is deﬁned as given in Supplementary
Table S1 and the maximum cluster size is set to 140 (Supplementary
Fig. S2A), a total of 12 subgroups are obtained along with the
number of sequences, the position with the maximal dependence
value, property, chi-square score and sequence logo of MDD-
clustered motif (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Moreover, a tree view of
MDD clustering is presented in Figure 2. Using all 1221 sequences,
it is observed that position +1 has the maximal dependence value
with the statistically signiﬁcant occurrence of imino amino acid, i.e.
proline (P).;hus, all data can be divided into two subgroups: one
subgroup (338 sequences) having the occurrence of imino amino
acid in position +1 and another subgroup (883 sequences) which
does not have the occurrence of imino amino acid in position +1.
Because both subgroups contain more than 140 sequences (the
value of maximum cluster size), these two subgroups are further
clustered using MDD. The recursive MDD clustering is terminated
after each subgroup in leaf node (marked in red box of Fig. 2)
has less than 140 sequences. It is observed in Figure 2 that the
sequences in the left-hand tree are associated with the proline-
directed kinase groups, such as MAPK and CDC2. In the right-hand
tree, the phosphorylation sites are mainly involved in basic (PKA,
PKB and PKC) and acid (CK2 and ATM) kinase groups. To verify
the results of MDD clustering, the 12 MDD-clustered motifs are

mapped to known kinase-speciﬁc motifs from Phospho.ELM. As
shown in Supplementary Table S3, group numbers 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
and 11 of MDD clustering are mapped to CDC2, MAPK, PKB,
PKA, CK2 and ATM kinase groups of Phospho.ELM, respectively.
In particular, the motif of Group 7 is similar to the substrate motif of
PKC iota which is a subfamily of PKC group. Additionally, Group 1
is mapped to the ERK motif which is a subfamily of MAPK group.
Interestingly, two novel MDD-clustered motifs (group number two
and three) are slightly similar to two known kinase motifs in humans,
PDKl (Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase) and TTBK (Tau
Tubulin Kinase). It follows from what has been demonstrated that
MDDLogo could accurately identify the kinase-speciﬁc motifs from
a large-scale phosphopeptides.

Given the difﬁculty in exploring conserved motifs in a large-
scale sequence data, this work presents a new approach MDDLogo.
MDDLogo applies MDD to cluster a group of aligned signal
sequences into subgroups having statistically signiﬁcant motifs.
With regard to the method for extracting phosphorylation motifs, an
iterative statistical approach, Motif-X (Schwartz and Gygi, 2005),
has been proposed. To compare the results, Motif-X is also applied
to detect the motifs from the 1221 human phosphorylation sites.
With a signiﬁcance value of 0.000001, a total of 19 motifs have
been identiﬁed by motif-x, as shown in Supplementary Table S4.
Table 1 presents a comparison of the detected motifs for the

1221 human phosphorylation sites using MDDLogo and Motif-
X. Although Motif-X could identify the motifs that are matched
to seven well-known kinase families, it is observed that several
motifs need to be combined in order to match the substrate motif
of a known kinase. For instance, Groups 1 (xxRRxSxxxxx) and 7
(xxRKxSxxxxx) resulting from Motif-X need to be combined to
match the substrate motif (xx[R/K][R/K]xSxxxxx) of PKA group.
The need for combining motifs also occurs in the PKB and the CK2
kinase groups. However, two motifs (Groups 15 and 16) that are not
detected using MDDLogo are matched to the substrate motif of PKC
eta, which is a subfamily of PKC group. The case study done using
1221 human phosphorylation sites involved with seven well-known
kinase families demonstrates the effectiveness of MDDLogo.

3.2 Investigation of known motifs and novel motifs in
plant phosphorylation sites

Protein phosphorylation is an important PTM that regulates various
cellular processes not only in humans but also in plants. However,
information regarding protein kinases that phosphorylate substrates
in plants is very limited (Gao et al., 2009). According to the
collection of experimentally veriﬁed plant phosphorylation data
from TAIR9 database (Huala et al., 2001), each phosphorylation site
is not annotated with its catalytic kinase. Thus, MDDLogo is adopted

to investigate the substrate speciﬁcity of various plant kinases based
on amino acid sequences. A total of 2506, 378 and 108 experimental
phosphorylation sites for serine (pSer), threonine (pThr) and tyrosine
(pTyr), respectively, are extracted from TAIR9. To comprehensively
explore the substrate speciﬁcity, a longer length of a window
centered on the phosphorylation site is applied. The ﬂanking amino
acids (— 10~+10) of the non-redundant phosphorylation sites are
graphically visualized as entropy plots of sequence logo using
WebLogo (Crooks, et al., 2004; Schneider and Stephens, 1990). As
presented in Supplementary Table S5, the entropy plots indicate that
pSer, pThr and pTyr have no conserved amino acids.

Applying MDDLogo resulted to 23 subgroups in pSer, six
subgroups in pThr, and six subgroups in pTyr. The conservation
of ﬂanking amino acids in each MDD-clustered subgroup is
represented using an entropy plot in the sequence logo. Based on
these sequence logo representations, the resulting MDD-clustered
subgroups could be further analyzed in order to combine subgroups
with highly similar amino acid motifs. This process allowed
us to categorize similar subgroups in pSer which resulted into
nine groups (Table 2), while pThr (Supplementary Table S6) and
pTyr (Supplementary Table S7) maintained six groups. However,
subgroups S9, T6 and Y6 are observed to show no signiﬁcantly
conserved amino acid at any position. In order to show that
each MDD-generated motif has potential kinase-speciﬁc substrate
speciﬁcity, each MDD-generated motif is matched against the
known kinase-speciﬁc motifs. To obtain known kinase-speciﬁc
motifs, all available kinase-speciﬁc phosphorylation sites were
obtained from Phospho.ELM (Diella et al., 2008), which is a
well-known database containing experimentally kinase-speciﬁc
phosphorylation data from multiple organisms. According to a chi-
square test on the dependence of ﬁve amino acid groups in ﬂanking
positions of plant pSer, the most featured motif is the group that

contains conserved proline (P) at position +1. This is matched to
MAPK kinase family of non-plant organisms in Phospho.ELM.
Furthermore, it is observed that S2 contains a conserved glutamic
acid (G) and aspartic acid (D) at positions +1, +2 and +3. A
similar conservation is seen in the CK2 kinase family of non-plant
organisms in Phospho.ELM. Thus, the pSer group S2 is matched
to CK2. Additionally, the conserved arginine (R) and lysine (K) at
position -3 in the pSer group S4 is observed to be similar with the
CAMK2 kinase family of non-plant organisms in Phospho.ELM;
therefore, S4 is matched to CAMK2. Overall, as presented in
Table 2, plant pSer groups S1, S2 and S4 are matched to kinase
families MAPK, CK2 and CAMK2, respectively. The remaining
pSer groups which contains signiﬁcantly conserved amino acids at
speciﬁc positions but have no matching kinases are considered to be
novel motifs of potential kinases in plants.

Similar to the matches in pSer groups, pThr groups T1 and T3
are matched to kinase families MAPK and CK2, respectively for
having similar conserved amino acids at the same position. Due
to the insufﬁcient data and unobvious kinase motifs of pTyr in
Phospho.ELM, the pTyr groups in Table S7 have no matching
kinases. Moreover, as observed in the unmatched pSer groups, the
remaining groups in pThr and pTyr contains signiﬁcantly conserved
amino acids at speciﬁc positions, therefore, these are also considered
to be novel kinase motifs in plants.

3.3 Improving the prediction of plant phosphorylation
sites

With regard to the computational identiﬁcation of plant
phosphorylation sites, PhosPhAt (Heazlewood et al., 2008) has
utilized a set of 802 experimentally validated pSer sites to develop
a classiﬁer of support vector machine (SVM) for identifying pSer
sites in Arabidopsis Thaliana. More recently, Gao et al. (2009)
incorporated protein sequence information and protein disordered
regions, and integrated k-nearest neighbor and SVM for predicting
phosphorylation sites. However, these two works mainly focus on
substrate speciﬁcity as phosphorylation data in plant species are
not well annotated in terms of kinase-speciﬁc substrate speciﬁcity.
There is a need to investigate potential catalytic kinases in plants and
utilize this information for predicting kinase-speciﬁc plant protein
phosphorylation sites. Thus, MDD-clustered motifs are utilized.

According to a 5-fold cross-validation evaluation using an
optimized threshold for the HMMER bit score, the predictive
performance of HMM using MDD clustering performs signiﬁcantly
better than the single HMM of pSer and pThr. As shown in Table 3,
the single HMM for pSer yields a precision rate of 49.5%, a
sensitivity rate of 58.6%, a speciﬁcity rate of 70.0% and an accuracy
rate of 66.2%. On the other hand, the performance of HMM
for MDD-clustered pSer sites yield a precision rate of 71.3%, a
sensitivity rate of 81.9%, a speciﬁcity rate of 81.9% and an accuracy
rate of 81.9%. With regard to pThr, using a single HMM yields a
precision rate of 45.4%, a sensitivity rate of 60.5%, a speciﬁcity
rate of 63.4% and an accuracy rate of 62.5%. On the other hand,
the performance of HMM for MDD-clustered pThr sites yield a
precision rate of 64.7%, a sensitivity rate of 78.8%, a speciﬁcity
rate of 78.4% and an accuracy rate of 78.5%.

In the case of pTyr, however, there is no signiﬁcant improvement
in MDD-clustered HMMs. Single HMM yields a precision rate of
75.4%, a sensitivity rate of 90.6%, a speciﬁcity rate of 84.7% and an

accuracy rate of 86.6%. On the other hand, the performance of HMM
for pThr with MDD clustering yields a precision rate of 75.5%, a
sensitivity rate of 92.6%, a speciﬁcity rate of 83.8% and an accuracy
rate of 86.7%. This result may be due to an insufﬁcient pTyr dataset
used in this work. It is observed that MDDLogo could improve the
identiﬁcation of plant phosphorylation sites when the data size is
sufﬁcient.

4 CONCLUSON

MDDLogo has been demonstrated to accurately identify kinase-
speciﬁc substrate motifs for 1221 human phosphorylation
sites associated with seven well-known kinase families from
Phospho.ELM. The ability of MDDLogo to discover motifs is
comparable with another well-known motif discovery tool, Motif-X.

The importance of phosphorylation has been indicated in the
regulation of protein functions and cell signaling in plants, but
the state of research in this ﬁeld is hindered by experimental
difﬁculties, especially for the investigation of substrate speciﬁcity in
various catalytic kinases. Due to the limitation in experimental data
regarding protein kinases that phosphorylate substrates in plants,
MDDLogo has been adopted to investigate the substrate speciﬁcity
of various plant kinases. After the application of MDD clustering,
a total of 9, 6 and 6 groups are detected for pSer, pThr and
pTyr, respectively. Interestingly, some of the groups are similar to
the substrate motifs of known kinase groups from the non-plant
organisms in Phospho.ELM. Although the newly identiﬁed motifs
could not be experimentally veriﬁed, it is important how MDDLogo
can help biologists to further investigate the substrate speciﬁcity of
potential catalytic kinases in plants. A more noteworthy beneﬁt is
that MDD-clustered motifs can be applied to improve the predictive
power of computationally identifying plant phosphorylation sites
with various substrate speciﬁcities, especially for pSer and pThr sites
with a sufﬁcient data size. Furthermore, the acquisition of additional
experimentally veriﬁed plant phosphorylation data will allow the
re-calibration of more robust MDD clusters.

In analyzing protein sequences, the grouping of amino acids
can be deﬁned by the users. The user can group amino acids
according to various physicochemical properties. Basically, MDD
clustering without the grouping of 20 amino acids is provided. ;everal

major grouping methods have been given. Also, in applying
MDD clustering, it is important to optimize the value of the
maximum cluster size. In general, MDD clustering could help users
investigate the conserved motifs behind a large-sized sequence
data. However, in some cases, more groups could produce more
noise. Therefore, users need to optimize the value of the maximum
cluster size to produce more meaningful clusters from a set of
uncharacterized sequence data. MDDLogo can be freely accessed
at http://csb.cse.yzu.edu.tw/MDDLogo/; a stand-alone program is
available as well. DNA and RNA sequences are both allowed for
use in MDDLogo.

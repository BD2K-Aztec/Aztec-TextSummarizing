ABSTRACT

Summary: Only recently the first resources devoted to the functional
annotation of proteins at the domain level started to appear. The next
step is to develop speciﬁc methodologies for predicting function at the
domain level based on these resources, and to implement them in web
servers to be used by the community. In this work, we present
COPRED, a web sen/er for the concomitant prediction of fold, molecular
function and functional sites at the domain level, based on a method-
ology for domain molecular function prediction and a resource of
domain functional annotations previously developed and benchmarked.
Availability and implementation: COPRED can be freely accessed at
http://csbg.cnb.csic.es/copred. The interface works in all standard web
browsers. WebGL (natively supported by most browsers) is required for
the in-Iine preview and manipulation of protein 3D structures. The web-
site includes a detailed help section and usage examples.

1 INTRODUCTION

The computational prediction of functional features for newly
sequenced proteins is an active ﬁeld of research because of the
pace at which these raw sequences are obtained and the difﬁcul-
ties associated with the experimental functional characterization.

The most widely used strategy for function prediction is to
transfer to the query sequence the functional features (e. g.
global function and functional residues) available for a homolo-
gous protein in a given database or annotation resource
(Rentzsch and Orengo, 2009; Valencia, 2005). Because of tech-
nical and historical reasons, most of these resources associate
functional descriptors to whole proteins, instead of individual
domains. Nevertheless, domains are the evolutionary, structural
and functional units of proteins and, at least in the case of ‘mo-
lecular functions’, these can be individually assigned to particular
domains or groups of domains within protein chains. The func-
tional independence of protein domains is exempliﬁed by the fact
that many domains found in multi-domain proteins also exist in
isolation, as independent proteins, in other organisms (Marcotte
et al., 1999). Although associating molecular functions to whole
chains without distinguishing the particular domain(s) respon-
sible for them is not an issue for many applications, it can lead
to problems in other cases (Lopez and Pazos, 2009). As

molecular functions are generally associated with whole chains
in the annotation resources, function prediction methods /servers,
based on matching against these annotations, predict molecular
function at the whole-chain level.

Only recently the first functional annotations at the domain
level started to appear (de Lima Morais et al., 2011; Lopez and
Pazos, 2009), highlighting the importance of associating molecu-
lar functions to domains and the consequences of not doing so in
particular cases. Accordingly, prediction methods adapted to
these resources and intended for predicting functions at the
domain level are required. We have developed one of these meth-
ods and showed that its performance in assigning function is
higher that a traditional sequence-based search (Lopez and
Pazos, 2013). The method is based on a resource of Gene
Ontology (Ashburner et al., 2000) molecular function annota-
tions (GO:MF) at the structural domain level (Lopez and
Pazos, 2009). In short, proﬁles are built for the structural
domains sharing the same GO:MF term and the same fold (so
that they can be structurally aligned). A significant match of a
particular region of a query sequence against one of these proﬁles
can be interpreted as a concomitant prediction of fold and
GO:MF function for the corresponding domain. Additionally,
the conserved positions in these proﬁles can be interpreted as
‘functional sites’ and consequently transferred to the aligned pos-
itions of the query sequence so as to obtain clues on possible
functionally important positions. For full details on the method-
ology and its evaluation see Lopez and Pazos (2013).

Here, we present COPRED, a web server that allows any user
to access this method and generate predictions using, in the sim-
plest case, only the query sequence as input. The predictions can
be inspected in a graphical interactive interface and downloaded
in a number of standard formats.

2 FUNCTIONALITY AND INTERFACE

Figure 1 shows some representative screenshots of COPRED’s
web interface. On the input page, the user can upload the amino
acid sequence of the query protein as only input, although an
‘advanced options’ button allows expanding the input form so as
to modify some parameters of the method. There is also a ‘ﬁll
with example’ button to test the server right away with the
example described in the help page.

After a successful run, which normally takes 5710s, all the
results can be accessed from a single page with different panels
that can be expanded/collapsed. The first row represents the
query sequence itself (blue in Fig. l), and expanding it allows

Fig. 1. Screenshots of COPRED web interface. Top-left: input page, with
links for accessing the help page, inserting an example and for retrieving
previous jobs. Bottom-left: unexpanded list of proﬁles (green) matching
different regions of the query sequence (blue). Top-right: expansion of the
‘GTPase activity (function)%.37 (fold)’ hit, with details on the region of
the query sequence matching that proﬁle, the predicted functional sites,
an in-line interactive 3D View of a representative structure of the proﬁle
and links for opening a J avlview applet with the multiple sequence align-
ment associated to the proﬁle, a Jmol applet with the implicit 3D model
and the PDB ﬁle with that model (bottom-right)

retrieving some data on the input, including a job ID that can be
later used to recover the results of previous runs (Via the ‘Results’
option on the input page). The results basically consist of a list of
profiles matching different regions of the query sequence, includ-
ing information on the fold and GO:MF term represented by
each of them (Fig. 1). For each hit, a graphical representation of
the region of the query sequence matched against the proﬁle is
shown, using a color scale (from green to black) to represent the
hit’s significance (E-Value). Consequently, this unexpanded list of
hits provides a ﬁrst overview of the domain composition of the
query sequence and the possible folds/functions of its domains.
In the example shown in Figure 1, the results are clearly pointing
to the presence of two domains: an N—terminal one, associated
with the C37 SCOP fold (‘P-loop nucleotide phosphate hydro-
lases’) and GTP—related GO:MF terms, and the middle domain
associated with the b.43-fold (‘Reductase/isomerase/elongation
factor common domain’) and RNA-bindingerelated GO:MF
terms. These features are in agreement with the domain compos-
ition, structural folds and functions of this example query protein
(Elongation factor Tu). Additionally, a set of red dots represent
the predicted functional sites transferred from the conserved pos-
itions of the corresponding proﬁle (according to a conservation
threshold controlled by the scroll-bar at the top of the page).
Expanding a given item of the hit list provides additional in-
formation on the corresponding proﬁle match (Fig. 1), such as
detailed information on the GO:MF term and SCOP fold, with
links to the corresponding databases. The sequence of the query
protein is also shown highlighting the region (domain) matching
that particular proﬁle and the transferred functional residues.
There is also an interactive representation of the 3D structure
of a representative member of that proﬁle. This can be manipu-
lated, e.g. zoomed, rotated and so forth. In this 3D View, the

region aligned against the query and the conserved residues are
highlighted. There is also a link for opening a Jalview
(Waterhouse et al., 2009) applet showing the multiple sequence
alignment associated with the profile, which also includes the
query sequence (Fig. 1). The implicit 3D model for that region
(domain) of the query protein is also shown in a Jmol applet
(www.jmol.org). Conserved positions are highlighted in both rep-
resentations. This implicit 3D model, which can be also down-
loaded as a standard PDB file from another link, contains the
backbone atoms of a representative template from the proﬁle
with the residues renamed to those of the query sequence.

3 CONCLUSION

Most proteins, especially in eukaryotic organisms comprise mul-
tiple domains (Apic et al., 2001). It is important to adapt the
function prediction workﬁows (annotation databases, methods
and so forth), mainly developed under a ‘1-chain-1-function’
paradigm, to this reality. Although many existing resources are
slowly starting to adopt a ‘domain-centric’ View, COPRED is the
ﬁrst server specifically devoted to this task. The main advantages
of this server are its ease of use and the fact that it provides a ﬁrst
glimpse of the domain structural and functional features of the
problem sequence in a concomitant way. The main limitation of
the COPRED server at this point is the relatively small scale of
the proﬁle database it uses, compared with other resources.
Nevertheless, these proﬁles can be built from any database of
functionally annotated structural domains. Therefore, the server
can be in principle expanded with larger sets domain annotations.

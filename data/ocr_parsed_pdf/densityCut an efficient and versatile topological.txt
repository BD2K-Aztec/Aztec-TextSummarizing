Abstract

Motivation: Many biological data processing problems can be formalized as clustering problems
to partition data points into sensible and biologically interpretable groups.

Results: This article introduces densityCut, a novel density—based clustering algorithm, which is
both time— and space—efficient and proceeds as follows: densityCut first roughly estimates the den—
sities of data points from a K—nearest neighbour graph and then refines the densities via a random
walk. A cluster consists of points falling into the basin of attraction of an estimated mode of the
underlining density function. A post—processing step merges clusters and generates a hierarchical
cluster tree. The number of clusters is selected from the most stable clustering in the hierarchical
cluster tree. Experimental results on ten synthetic benchmark datasets and two microarray gene
expression datasets demonstrate that densityCut performs better than state—of—the—art algorithms
for clustering biological datasets. For applications, we focus on the recent cancer mutation cluster—
ing and single cell data analyses, namely to cluster variant allele frequencies of somatic mutations
to reveal clonal architectures of individual tumours, to cluster single—cell gene expression data to
uncover cell population compositions, and to cluster single—cell mass cytometry data to detect
communities of cells of the same functional states or types. densityCut performs better than com—
peting algorithms and is scalable to large datasets.

1 Introduction

Clustering analysis (unsupervised machine learning), which organ—
izes data points into sensible and meaningful groups, has been in—
creasingly used in the analysis of high—throughput biological
datasets. For example, The Cancer Genome Atlas project has gener—
ated multiple 0mics data for individual patients. One can cluster the
0mics data of individuals into subgroups of potential clinical rele—
vance. To study clonal evolution in individual cancer patients, we
can cluster variant allele frequencies of somatic mutations, such that

mutations in the same cluster are accumulated during a specific
stage of clonal expansion. Emerging technologies such as single—cell
sequencing have made it possible to cluster single—cell gene expres—
sion data to detect rare cell populations, or to reveal lineage rela—
tionships (Pollen et (11., 2014; Xu et (11., 2015). One can cluster
single—cell mass cytometry data to study intratumour heterogeneity
(Levine et (11., 2015). As measurement technology advances have
drastically enhanced our abilities to generate various high—through—
put datasets, there is a great need to develop efficient and robust

clustering algorithms to analyze large N (number of data points),
large D (dimensions of data) datasets, with the ability to detect arbi—
trary shape clusters and automatically determine the number of
clusters.

The difficulties of clustering analysis lie in part with the defin—
ition of a cluster. Of the numerous proposed clustering algorithms,
the density—based clustering algorithms (Fraley et (11., 2007;
Fukunaga et (11., 1975 ) are appealing because of the probabilistic
interpretation of a cluster generated by these algorithms. Let D :
{xiﬁihxi 6 RD be drawn from an unknown density function
f (x),x E X C RD. For model—based approaches such as Gaussian
mixture models f (x) : 25:1 nCN(x)uC,2c), a cluster is considered
as the points generated from a mixture component, and the cluster—
ing problem is to estimate the parameters of the density function
from D (Fraley et (11., 2007). To analyze datasets consisting of com—
plex shape clusters, nonparametric methods such as kernel density
estimation can be used to estimate ﬁx) :  K),(x,x,-), where
K),(-) is the kernel function with bandwidth 17. Here, a cluster is
defined as the data points associated with a ‘mode’ of the density
function  (Wishart, 1969). The widely used ‘mean—shift’ algo—
rithm (Cheng, 1995; Comaniciu et (11., 2002; Fukunaga et (11., 1975)
belongs to this category, and it locates the modes of the kernel
density function ﬁx) by iteratively moving a point along the density
gradient until convergence. This algorithm, however, is computa—
tionally expensive, having time complexity O(N2T), where T is
the number of iterations, typically dozens of iterations are suffi—
cient for most cases. A more efficient, non—iterative graph—based ap—
proach (Koontz et (11., 1976) constructs trees such that each data
point x,- represents a node of a tree, the parent of node x,- is a
point x,- which is in the direction closest to the gradient direction
Vﬂxi), and the root of a tree corresponds to a mode of 1? Then
each tree constitutes a cluster. This algorithm has been used to re—
duce the time complexity of the mean—shift algorithm to O(N2)
(Vedaldi et (11., 2008), and has been extended in several ways, e.g.
constructing trees after filtering out noisy modes (Rodriguez et (11.,
2014).

Nonparametric clustering methods have been generalized to pro—
duce a hierarchical cluster tree (Hartigan, 1975). Consider the A
level set of a density function f(x):

L(/1;f(x)) = {le(x) Z l}-

The ‘high level clusters’ at level A are the connected components
of L(A;f (in the topological sense, the maximal connected sub—
sets of L(l; f (x))). As 1 goes from 0 to maxf(x), the high level clus—
ters at all levels constitute the level set tree, where the leaves of the
tree correspond to the modes of  (Stuetzle et (11., 2010). The
widely used DBSCAN algorithm (Ester et (11., 1996) extracts the
high level clusters at just one given level A. Many original
approaches for level set tree construction in statistics (Menardi
et (11., 2013) take the straightforward ‘plug—in’ approach to estimat—
ing the level set tree from ﬁx) by partitioning the feature space, i.e.
X. Therefore, they are computationally demanding, especially for
high—dimensional data. Recently, efficient algorithms have been pro—
posed to partition the samples 1) directly (Chaudhuri et (11., 2010;
Kpotufe et (11., 2011 ). Recovering the level set tree from a finite data—
set is more difficult than partitioning the dataset into separate clus—
ters. Correspondingly, theoretical analyses show that for these
algorithms to identify salient clusters from finite samples, the num—
ber of data points N needs to grow exponentially in the dimension
D (Chaudhuri et (11., 2010; Kpotufe et (11., 2011). Moreover, al—
though the level set tree provides a more informative description of
the structure of the data, many applications still need the cluster

membership of each data point, which is not available directly from
the level set tree.

The spectral clustering algorithm (Ng et (11., 2002; Shi et (11.,
2000) works on an N by N pairwise data similarity matrix S, where
each element Si)- measures the similarity between x,- and xi. The simi—
larity matrix can be considered as the adjacency matrix of a
weighted graph g : (V, E), where vertex 11,- represents x,- and the
edge weight Eiﬁi : Si). Given the number of clusters C, the spectral
clustering algorithm partitions the graph g into C disjoint, approxi—
mately equal size clusters, such that the points in the same cluster
are ‘similar’, while points in different clusters are ‘dissimilar’. In
contrast to density—based methods, the spectral clustering algorithm
does not make assumptions on the probabilistic model which gener—
ates data D (Von Luxburg, 2007). Therefore, selecting the number
of clusters is a challenging problem for spectral clustering algo—
rithms, especially in the presence of outliers or when the number of
clusters is large. In addition, the spectral clustering algorithm is
time—consuming because it needs to compute the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of the row—normalized similarity matrix S, requiring @(
N3) time. Instead of using single value decomposition to calculate
the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, the power iteration clustering al—
gorithm (PIC) (Lin et (11., 2010) iteratively smoothes a random initial
vector by the row—normalized similarity matrix, such that the points
in the same cluster will be similar in value. Then the k—means algo—
rithm is used to partition the smoothed vector into C clusters.
Although PIC has a time complexity of O(N2T), where T is the
number of iterations, PIC may encounter many difficulties in prac—
tice. First, the points from two quite distinct clusters may have very
similar ‘smoothed’ densities, and therefore they may not be distin—
guishable by k—means. Second, the points in a non—convex shape
cluster can break into several clusters. As the number of clusters in—
creases, these problems become more severe (Lin et (11., 2010).

In this article, we introduce a simple and efficient clustering algo—
rithm, densityCut, which shares some advantages of both density—
based clustering algorithms and spectral clustering algorithms. As
for spectral clustering algorithms, densityCut works on a similarity
matrix; thus it is computationally efficient, even for high—dimen—
sional data. Using a sparse K—nearest neighbour graph further
reduced the time complexity. Besides, we can use a random walk on
the K—nearest neighbour graph to estimate densities at each point.
As for many density—based clustering algorithms, densityCut is sim—
ple, efficient, and there is no need to specify the number of clusters
as an input. Moreover, densityCut inherits both methods’ advantage
of detecting arbitrarily shaped clusters. Finally, densityCut offers a
novel way to build a hierarchical cluster tree and to select the most
stable clustering. We first benchmark densityCut against widely
used ten simulation datasets and two microarray gene expression
datasets to demonstrate its robustness. We then use densityCut to
cluster variant allele frequencies of somatic mutations to infer clonal
architectures in tumours, to cluster single—cell gene expression data
to uncover cell population compositions, and to cluster single—cell
mass cytometry data to detect communities of cells of the same func—
tional states or types.

2 Methods

The densityCut method consists of four major steps (Supplementary
Algorithm 1): (i) density estimation: given a set of data points
1) : {xiﬁil ,x, 6 RD , form a directed unweighted K—nearest neigh—
bour graph and estimate the densities of data points by using the
K—nearest neighbour density estimator; (ii) density refinement: refine

the initial densities via a random walk on the unweighted K—nearest
neighbour graph; (iii) local—maxima based clustering: detect local
maxima of the estimated densities, and assign the remaining points
to the local maxima; (iv) hierarchical stable clustering: refine the ini—
tial clustering by merging neighbour clusters. This cluster merging
step produces a hierarchical clustering tree, and the final clustering
is obtained by choosing the most stable clustering as the threshold in
merging clusters varies. Figure 1 demonstrates how densityCut
works on a toy example (Fu et 41]., 2007). Below we discuss each
step in detail.

2.1 Density estimation
We adopt the K—nearest neighbour density estimator to estimate the
density at x 6 RD (Fig. 1(a)):

(K—1)/N

fK(X) = —VK(X)

(1)
where VK(X) : VD >< (rK(x))D is the volume of the smallest ball cen—
tred at x containing K points from D. VD is the volume of the unit
ball in the D—dimensional space, and rK(x) is the distance from x to
its Kth nearest neighbour. Compared to the widely used kernel dens—
ity estimator, K—nearest neighbour density estimates are easier to
compute, and also the parameter K is more intuitive to set than the
kernel bandwidths for kernel density estimators. Here for simplicity,
we only calculate the densities at data points from 1), represented by
f0 : (f?,...,f£1)T, where f," :fK(x,-) and the superscript ‘0’ indi—
cates that this is the initial Knn density estimate since we will refine

this density in the next section. Figure 1(b) shows the estimated den—
sities at each data point.

When computing the Knn densities, we can get the K—nearest
neighbour graph g as a byproduct with the following adjacency
matrix:

1 X,- E Knn(x,-)

Wu Z . (2)
0 otherw15e

As x,- maps to node v,- in the Knn graph g, we next use ‘points’
and ‘nodes’ interchangeably.

The Knn graph g is a directed unweighted graph. While the sets
of in—vertices and out—vertices of many nodes may overlap signifi—
cantly, some outliers may have few, if any in—vertices. In addition,
points at the boundary of density changes may also have quite differ—
ent sets of in—vertices and out—vertices because their in—vertices com—
monly consist of points from low—density regions while out—vertices
are usually from high—density regions.

2.2 A random walk based density refinement

As Knn density estimates are based on order statistics and tend to be
noisy, we next introduce a way to refine the initial Knn density vec—
tor fo : (1‘10, . . . , 193)? Our refinement is based on the intuition that
(i) a high—density vertex belongs to one of the K—nearest neighbours
of many vertices, and (ii) a vertex tends to have high density if its in—
vertices also have high densities. For example, point [2 in Figure 1(a)
has nine in—vertices, and these vertices are in high—density regions,
and indeed, the density of k is 0.0087 which is higher than average

for this example. Based on the above assumptions, we get the fol—
lowing recursive definitions of densities:

fit+1 :  piﬁifit .1. (1 — oi)fI-O (3)

where or E [0, 1] specifies the relative importance of information
from vi’s in—vertices and the initial density estimate fio, which is the
K—nearest neighbour density estimate. If each row of P sums to one,
P is a Markov transition matrix, which contains the transition prob—
ability from a vertex to its K out—vertices. Therefore, Equation 3 de—
fines a random walk with restart. The refined density vector is the
stationary distribution of the random walk on the Knn graph with
adjacency matrix P. We can row—normalize matrix W to get
P : DT1W, where D : diag(ZI-W1ﬁ,-, . . . ,ZI-WNJ). Compared to
the original Knn densities in Figure 1(b), the refined densities in
Figure 1(c) have fewer ‘local maxima’ (shown as triangle points, see
next section for details). Similar methods have been used in informa—
tion retrieval and semi—supervised learning applications (Page et (11.,
1999).

Equation 3 can be solved exactly in the limit by f : (1 — or)fo
(I — orP)‘1 if at < 1. Therefore, the above iterations guarantee con—
vergence. When at : 1, ft converges to a left eigenvector of P with the
maximum eigenvalue of 1. In our computational experiments, when
at < 1, e.g. or : 0.90, Equation 3 typically converges within a few
dozen iterations, and can be much faster than the case when or : 1.
This rough density estimation process is faster than methods which
attempt to solve density estimation to a high degree of precision
since density estimation is well known to be a difficult problem.
Moreover, our method can be applied to data that are presented in
the form of a graph, rather than as data points over the reals.

2.3 Local—maxima based clustering

After obtaining densities for points, we estimate the ‘modes’ of the
underlying probability density function. The modes are the ‘local
maxima’ of the density function with zero gradients. For finite sam—
ples, the modes are rarely located exactly at points x,- E D, so we use
the points close to the modes instead. Mathematically, modes can be
approximated by points {xijmax1xi_xi1<,f,- S  where e is a small
distance threshold. The distance 6 is dataset dependent and difficult
to choose in practice. Instead, we can define a mode as a vertex
whose density is the largest among all of its in—vertices:

{UiWPir > Orfi < fr} (4)

Here, we use in—vertices instead of out—vertices in order to be
able to detect small cluster with less than K data points. As the verti—
ces of a small cluster with less than K vertices can form a clique (or
are highly connected to each other) in the Knn graph, we can detect
this small cluster based on the definition of local maxima above if
these points are not among the K—nearest neighbours of points out—
side this cluster. A potential problem is that some outliers with very
few in—vertices could be detected as local maxima. We simply re—
move those local maxima whose numbers of in—vertices are less than
K/2. In other words, we treat a cluster less than K/2 in size as an
‘outlier’ cluster, and densityCut is unlikely to detect this small
cluster.

Data points that fall into the basin of attraction of each mode
constitute a cluster. This process can be done by moving each point
along its gradient direction to reach a mode. We modify the efficient
graph—based hill—climbing algorithm (Koontz et (11., 1976) to build a
unique forest (a set of trees) for a given dataset. The parent of vertex
v,- is defined as

Parent(v,-) : arg  — dini <  (5)

where N,- is the set of in—vertices of 11,-. In other words, the parent of
v,- is the vertex which is closest to 11,- among all of v,’s in—vertices that
have higher densities than 11,-. From the construction of the trees, we
can see that each vertex is associated with just one tree. Therefore,
each tree can be considered as a cluster. Figure 1(d) shows the clus—
ters by assigning data points to the seven local maxima.

2.4 Hierarchical stable clustering

We then generate a hierarchical cluster tree and select the most sta—
ble clustering. First the density of the root of a tree T generated
above is called the height of this tree, denoted by 177, which has the
largest density among all the vertices in T. Then we define the
boundary points between trees T1 and T2:

3611,72):{UETjjleE/Vyﬂ’TLfy < fu} 

Sets B(T1,T2) and B(T2,T1) are not the same: B(T1,T2) C T1
and B(T2, T1) C T2. The valley separating two trees is:

Valley(T1,T2):B(T1,T2)UB(T2,T1), (7)
The height of the valley separating T1 and T 2 is defined as
(8)

lo : max
Vﬁlley<T1 ’TZ) r/EValley(T1,T2) ft]

The saliency index 11 of a valley represents the relative height of
the valley compared to the shorter tree:

hValley(T1,T2)

11(71, Tl) : min(]771,]’7T2)

(9)
Figure 2(a) shows the height of the valley (the length of the grey

arrow) separating two adjacent trees, and the saliency index is the

ratio between the length of the grey arrow and the black arrow.

The saliency index defined in Equation 9 has several properties.
First, 0 g u g 1, and u is invariant under scaling of the densities by
a positive constant factor. This ‘scale—free’ property is very useful for
us to select a threshold for merging trees. Second, it automatically
scales to the local densities of trees, e.g. to get the same saliency
index, the height of the valley separating two trees in low—density re—
gions is shorter than that separating two trees in high—density
regions.

We can merge two clusters if the saliency index between them is
above a threshold 11. When the saliency index 11 : 1, no clusters get
merged, and when 11:0, all the connected clusters get merged to
form a single cluster. Therefore, by gradually decreasing the saliency
index threshold, we can get a hierarchical clustering tree, which is
useful for us to interpret the structure of data, especially for high—

dimensional data. Figure 1(e) shows the cluster tree from merging
neighbouring clusters in Figure 1(d).

For a dataset consisting of clusters whose densities are consider—
ably different, a single K for density estimation may be insufficient.
This is because the points from a high—density cluster need a larger K
to estimate their densities, compared to the points from a low—dens—
ity cluster. The high—density cluster could ‘break’ into several small
clusters when K is small. Instead of picking the parameter K on a
data point basis, we can adjust the height of a valley by:

A fi < hValle T ,T
hValley(T1,Tz) = <1 +  hValley(T1,Tz) (10)

The intuition behind this density adjustment step is that a high—
density valley could be an artefact caused by splitting a high—density
cluster. Figure 1(f) shows the cluster tree using the saliency indexes
based on the adjusted valley heights. A potential problem of this
step is that it also increases the valley height between two genuine
clusters and increases their likelihood to merge. For example, as can
be seen from Figure 1(e, f), the two clusters merge at saliency index
around 0.30 before valley adjustment, but merge at saliency index
around 0.35 after valley adjustment. We will further investigate the
inﬂuence of this density adjustment step on clustering in later
sections.

We finally introduce a method to determine the number of clus—
ters to produce the final clustering from the hierarchical cluster tree.
The basic idea is that by gradually decreasing the saliency index,
clusters will get merged. Noisy, non—salient clusters will get merged
quickly, and true clusters will exist for a long period of time. We
therefore can calculate the length of saliency index change for pro—
ducing a fixed number of clusters, and select the cluster number
which spans the longest saliency index changes. In our current im—
plementation of densityCut, we decrease the saliency index evenly
and therefore we can interpret the saliency index change interval as
‘Frequency’. Figure 1(g) shows the cluster number frequency plot,
and Figure 1 (h) shows the final clustering by merging the initial clus—
tering to produce two clusters as selected by the cluster number fre—
quency plot.

2.5 Complexity analysis and implementation
densityCut has been implemented in the statistical computation lan—
guage R. densityCut has a worst—case time complexity of O(NK
+C2) and a space complexity of O(NK + C2), where N is the num—
ber of data points, K is the number of neighbours and C is the num—
ber of clusters (local maxima). In practice, as a majority of clusters
are only adjacent to few clusters, the time and space complexity is
typically of O(NK + C). We did not consider the time used to com—
pute the Knn graph in densityCut as numerous algorithms have been
developed for efficient Knn search with different complexities, and
typically it takes less time to compute the Knn graph compared to
cluster the data. To build the Knn graph given a data matrix, effi—
cient algorithms such as kd—trees can be used in low—dimensional
spaces (D S 20) with time complexity O(Nlog(N)) (Mount, 1998).
To build the Knn graph in high—dimensional spaces (D<1000),
efficient software libraries based on random projection exist to re—
peatedly partition the data to build a tree (https://github.com/spo
tify/annoy). This algorithm can run in O(NDT) time, where T is the
number of trees, and typically dozens of trees are enough to preserve
the accuracy of Knn search.

To demonstrate the scalability of densityCut, we tested
densityCut on a Mac desktop computer running OS X Version
10.9.5. The computer has 32 GB of RAM and a 3.5 GHz four—core

Intel i7 processor with 8 MB cache. We carried out all the experi—
ments presented in the article on this computer.

We sampled {212,214,216,218,220} data points from a mixture
of 64 two—dimensional Gaussian distributions. As can be seen from
Figure 2(b), the running time increased almost linearly in the num—
ber of data points. It took about 127 CPU seconds to cluster a mil—
lion data points (N : 220).

2.6 Parameter setting

Our algorithm has two parameters: the number of nearest neigh—
bours K, and the damping factor or in density refinement. K should
be small enough to detect local maxima, e.g. smaller than the num—
ber of data points in a cluster. However, very small K can result in
poor density estimates and produce large numbers of clusters, thus
‘overfitting’ the data, and there may not exist a ‘gap’ in the cluster
number frequency plot for us to select the number of clusters. On
the contrary, for large K, densityCut may fail to detect detailed
structures thus ‘underfitting’ the data.

Theoretical analysis for spectral clustering shows that K should
be Q(log(N)) to produce a connected graph (Von Luxburg, 2007),
and limit results are obtained under conditions K / log(N) —> 00 and
K/N —> 0. K is also dependent on the dimensionality D. For the
density estimate at x (f (x) is Lipchitz smooth in a neighbour of x)
from its K—nearest neighbours, under conditions k/NZ/(ZTD) —> 0
and k —> 00, we can get   (Dasgupta et (11.,
2014)

In practice, K should be dataset dependent. For example, if the
Euclidean distance is used, K should be sufficiently small such that
the Euclidean distance is a good measure of the distance between
two close data points even the data lie in a manifold. If the number
of clusters is small, K should increase to prevent generating too
many local maxima. We therefore conducted an empirical study of
the inﬂuence of K and or on clustering the data in Figure 1, for which
N:240 (Supplementary Figs S1 and S2). First, when K : logz
(N) : 8, densityCut correctly detected the two clusters given differ—
ent values for or (Supplementary Fig. S1). Small K : log2(N) : 4
produced ‘spiky’ density estimates and resulted in many local max—
ima (Supplementary Fig. S1). On the contrary, large K produced ﬂat
density estimates, and the two true clusters tended to merge because
of no deep valley between them (Supplementary Fig. S1). We there—
fore used a default value of K : logz In addition, when or : 0.9
or 0.99, densityCut correctly detected the two clusters given differ—
ent values for K. Increasing or produced better clustering results but
it took much longer for the density refinement step to converge, e.g.
median 176 iterations when or : 0.99 compared to 41 iterations
when or : 0.90. We set the default value for or : 0.90 as it made a
good compromise between accuracy and execution time.

The valley height adjustment step plays a role of ‘smoothing’ the
density estimates. This functionality is especially useful for small K.
For example, even when K : 0.5log2(N) : 4, densityCut correctly
detected the two clusters after adjusting the heights of valleys
(Supplementary Fig. S2). For all the results presented in this article,
we used the default parameter setting (K : log2(N) and or : 0.9)
with the valley height adjustment step.

3.1 Benchmarking against state—of—the—art algorithms

We benchmarked densityCut against state—of—the—art clustering algo—
rithms for biological datasets (Wiwie et (11., 2015) on synthetic

datasets that have been widely used to evaluate clustering algo—
rithms. Specifically, we compared densityCut with three best algo—
rithms reported in Wiwie et al. (2015) (Supplementary Materials), i.
e. the hierarchical clustering algorithm (HC, from the R stats pack—
age) with average linkage, the partitioning around medoids (PAM,
from the R cluster package) algorithm and the density—based cluster—
ing algorithm OPTICS (from the R dbscan package). We also com—
pare densityCut with the Gaussian mixture model (GMM, from the
R mclust package) based clustering algorithm and the normalized
cut (NCut, from the R kernlab package) spectral clustering algo—
rithm. We used ten synthetic datasets (the eight ‘shape’ datasets and
the two most challenging ‘S—sets’), downloaded from http://cs.joen
suu.fi/sipu/datasets/. Seven out of the ten datasets were also used in
Wiwie et al. (2015) (except for the most challenging case ‘S4’ from
the S—set, the challenging ‘Jain’ dataset and the ‘D31’ dataset with
large number of clusters — 31 clusters). For the algorithms requiring
the number of clusters as a input parameter (PAM, GMM and
NCut), we set the number of clusters as the ground truth cluster
number for each dataset. For HC, we cut the dendrogram to pro—
duce the ground truth number of clusters for each dataset.

To measure clustering performance, we compared the clustering
results from each algorithm to the ground truth to compute the max—
imum—matching measure (MMM, range from 0 to 1), the normal—
ized mutual information (NMI, range from 0 to 1) and the adjusted
Rand index (ARI, with expected value of zero and maximum value
of one). For all these measures, high values mean high similarity be—
tween two sets. More information about these measures can be
found in Supplementary Materials.

As shown in Supplementary Figure S3, densityCut performed the
best in terms of the above evaluation measures (with mean MMM,
NMI and ARI of 0.911, 0.897 and 0.854). Overall, the clustering re—
sults on these synthetic benchmark datasets demonstrated that
densityCut can produce excellent results if the high—density clusters
were separated by low—density valleys. For the datasets in
Supplementary Figure S3(a, c—e, g—j), densityCut detected the right
number of clusters and revealed the structures of these datasets. The
red colour cluster in Supplementary Figure S3(b) was considered as
two separated clusters originally (Zahn, 1971). However, the sparse
background points and the centre high—density points could be con—
sidered as from the same cluster for density—based clustering. For the
dataset in Figure 3(f), densityCut failed to detect the three clusters
because there were no ‘deep’ valleys between the outer arc cluster
and the two Gaussian clusters. Therefore, the outer arc cluster got
merged to the right Gaussian cluster. Without the valley height ad—
justment step, densityCut generated the same clustering
(Supplementary Fig. S4). The density—based clustering algorithm
OPTICS ranked second with mean MMM, NMI and ARI of 0.840,
0.717 and 0.685, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S3, last column;
Supplementary Fig. S5(a)).

PAM and GMM performed poorly on the datasets consisting of
irregular shape clusters (Supplementary Fig. S3(a—f), last column).
PAM results on these datasets had mean MMM, NMI and ARI of 0.
687, 0.492 and 0.414, respectively, and GMM results on these data—
sets had mean MMM, NMI and ARI of 0.617, 0.441 and 0.311, re—
spectively. However, PAM did very well on the datasets where the
points in each cluster were sampled from a two—dimensional
Gaussian distribution with mean MMM, NMI and ARI of 0.908, 0.
870 and 0.828 (Supplementary Fig. S3(g—j), last column). In con—
trast, GMM performed inferior to PAM on these datasets with
mean MMM, NMI and ARI of 0.787, 0.826 and 0.716. For ex—
ample, for ‘D31’ in Supplementary Figure S5(e), cluster two con—
sisted of only a single data point, and cluster nine consisted of two

data points. Cluster three and 18 consisted of points from multiple
Gaussian distributions. One major reason for the failure of GMM
was that the relatively large number of clusters (31) compared to the
limited number of data points (3100) and the overlapped clusters re—
sulted in many local maxima in its objective log—likelihood function,
While the Expectation—Maximization algorithm for fitting GMM
only searched for a local maximum of the objective function. By
contrast, densityCut directly located the high—density peaks and se—
lected the most stable clustering, and thus it was less likely inﬂu—
enced by spurious density peaks.

Both HC and NCut can cluster datasets consisting of arbitrary
shape clusters. On the datasets consisting of non—convex shape clus—
ters, HC (with mean MMM, NMI and ARI of 0.788, 0.589 and

0.577) and NCut (with mean MMM, NMI and ARI of 0.771, 0.628
and 0.55) performed slightly better than PAM and GMM
(Supplementary Fig. S3(a—f), last column). On the datasets consist—
ing of convex shape clusters, HC (with mean MMM, NMI and ARI
of 0.810, 0.841 and 0.746) and NCut (with mean MMM, NMI and
ARI of 0.746, 0.814 and 0.678) performed slightly worse than PAM
and GMM (Supplementary Fig. S3(g—j), last column). Compared to
HC and NCut, densityCut performed better in both the datasets
consisting of arbitrary shape clusters (with mean MMM, NMI and
ARI of 0.922, 0.919 and 0.886) and the datasets consisting of con—
vex shape clusters (with mean MMM, NMI and ARI of 0.895, 0.
863 and 0.807). Moreover, densityCut had low complexity and was
scalable to large datasets.

3.1.2 Microarray gene expression data

Gene expression data have been used to stratify cancer patients into
biologically or clinically meaningful subtypes, e.g. different subtypes
of patients have distinct prognosis. Here, we tested densityCut on
the two microarray gene expression datasets as in Back et al. (2011)
(Supplementary Materials). The results in Supplementary Figure S6
show that densityCut performs the best on these two datasets (with
MMM, NMI and ARI of 0.926, 0.780 and 0.853 on dataset one,
and 0.981, 0.860 and 0.924 on dataset two) compared with PAM,
HC, OPTICS, NCut and GMM.

Although OPTICS produced good results on the previous two
dimensional synthetic datasets, it performed poorly on these high—
dimensional gene expression datasets (ten dimensions are considered
as high dimensions for density—based clustering in Kriegel et (11.,
2011). OPTICS produced just one cluster for each dataset. Although
the absolute distances between data points are not discriminative in
high—dimensional spaces (the curse of dimensionality, the distances
between any two points are approximately the same), the relative
distances (the order of closeness) could still be meaningful, and
could be captured by the Knn graph. densityCut explores the top—
ology of the Knn graph thus performed better on high—dimensional
spaces than OPTICS. GMM (with MMM, NMI and ARI of 0.626,
0.621 and 0.408 on dataset one, and 0.962, 0.765 and 0.850 on
dataset two) and PAM (with MMM, NMI and ARI of 0.714, 0.583
and 0.411 on dataset one, and 0.952, 0.727 and 0.815 on dataset
two) performed relatively well on these datasets. The results were
consistent with the results from the previous study that GMM and
PAM (more precisely, the k—means algorithm) performed well on
clustering gene expression data (de Souto et (11., 2008).

3.2 Inferring clonal architectures of individual tumours
Cancer cells are heterogeneous, and a subpopulation of cancer cells
of the same patient could harbour different sets of mutations (Miller
et (11., 2014). Moreover, cancer cells frequently accumulate add—
itional mutations after treatment or in metastasis. Understanding
the clonal architecture of each tumour provides insights into tumour
evolution and treatment responses. We used densityCut to cluster
the somatic variant allele frequencies (VAF) measured from DNA
sequencing of multiple tumour biopsies. The mutations in each clus—
ter were accumulated during a specific stage of clonal expansion.
The clustering results provide valuable information of the clonal
architectures of tumours.

We first tested densityCut on the mutation data from a primary
myelofibrosis (PMF) patient (Engle et (11., 2015). This patient was
first diagnosed with PMF, and seven years later, this patient’s tu—
mour transformed to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). After chemo—
therapy treatment, the patient underwent complete remission.

However, 1.5 years later, the patient redeveloped PMF but no evi—
dence of AML relapse. A total of 649 single nucleotide variants de—
tected in whole genome sequencing of either PMF, AML or relapse
PMF genomes were validated by targeted high—coverage sequencing.
We used densityCut to jointly cluster the targeted sequencing VAFs
from PMF, AML and relapse PMF tissues. Figure 3(a) shows that
densityCut grouped the mutations into four clusters. The hierarch—
ical clustering trees and the accompanying cluster number frequency
plots are in Supplementary Figure S7(a).

Overall, densityCut clustering results matched those presented in
the original study. However, to produce the results, the authors
(Engle et (11., 2015) used different algorithms and several pre—pro—
cessing steps. For example, the authors used DBSCAN (Ester et (11.,
1996) to detect outliers (the mutations with circles ‘°’ in Fig. 3(a)),
and then used Mclust (Fraley et (11., 2007) for model selection and
final clustering analysis. The maximum number of clusters was lim—
ited to four, and each cluster had to contain at least seven mutations
(Engle et (11., 2015). In contrast, we directly used densityCut to clus—
ter the VAFs and produced exactly the same results (MMM: 1, the
outliers were not considered in calculating MMM.) We also changed
the parameter K from the default log2(N) : 10 to 210g2(N) until
1010g2(N Only after K was set to 8log2(N), the red colour cluster
and the violet colour cluster got merged, as can be seen from
Figure 3(b). For K < 8log2(N), densityCut produced the same four
clusters. OPTICS, PAM, HC, NCut and GMM produced the same
results as densityCut results (to be exact, only PAM assigned one
point to different clusters, Supplementary Fig. S8(c)). However, ex—
cept for OPTICS, these algorithms either need the number of clusters
as input parameters or cut the dendrogram to produce the desired
number of clusters (HC).

Next, we tested densityCut on the acute myeloid leukaemia sam—
ple AML28 (Ding et (11., 2012). We jointly clustered the VAFs from
sequencing both the primary tumour and the relapse tumour after
26 months of chemotherapy (Ding et (11., 2012). Figure 3(c) shows
that densityCut grouped the 804 detected somatic mutations into
five clusters. The results matched those predicted by sciClone
(Miller et (11., 2014), a variational Bayesian mixture model based
clustering algorithm. Only one mutation (with circle ‘°’ in Fig. 3(c))
was assigned to the red cluster by densityCut, but originally assigned
to the cyan cluster by sciClone (MMM : 0.999). densityCut is much
more efficient than sciClone as can be seen from Figure 3(d).
sciClone took a median of 48.12 s to run on the AML28 dataset
while densityCut took a median of 0.074 s to run. Because it took
less than a CPU second to run densityCut, we ran both algorithms
ten times to get a more accurate estimation of the time used. For
competing algorithms, PAM split the large cluster into two clusters
because it tends to generate equal—size clusters (with MMM, NMI
and ARI of 0.619, 0.509 and 0.767; Supplementary Fig. S8(g)). HC
assigned some ‘outliers’ to a distinct clusters, and merged the points
from two clusters (with MMM, NMI and ARI of 0.939, 0.964 and
0.929; Supplementary Fig. S8(h)). Similarly, GMM modelled the
outliers using a Gaussian component (with MMM, NMI and ARI of
0.925, 0.865 and 0.891; Supplementary Fig. S8(j)). OPTICS results
differed from densityCut results by the assignment of only one data
point (Supplementary Fig. S8(f)), and NCut produced the same re—
sults as densityCut results (Supplementary Fig. S8(i)).

Finally, we used densityCut to cluster the somatic mutations
from whole genome sequencing of the lung/pancreatic metastasis
pair from the same melanoma patient MEL5 (Ding et (11., 2014).
Compared to blood cancer genomes, melanoma genomes are much
more complex, frequency harbouring copy number alterations. The
combinations of copy number alterations, homozygous mutations

and heterozygous mutations make it a challenging task to develop a
model to uncover the clonal structure of these cancer genomes (Roth
et (11., 2014). The densityCut clustering results in Figure 3(e) show
that the mutations in MEL5 could be grouped into 12 clusters, pro—
viding the starting point for detailed inspection of the clonal struc—
ture of this cancer genome. Additional information such as copy
number alterations would be required to fully interpret the clonal
architectures. We also ran sciClone, which produced ten clusters
(Supplementary Fig. S9). Both algorithms agreed in clustering 84.
8% of the mutations (MMM: 0.848, Fig. 3(e)). densityCut cluster—
ing had an average silhouette width of 0.58 (Supplementary Fig.
S10), which was higher than sciClone clustering average silhouette
width of 0.55 (Supplementary Fig. S11). Other competing algo—
rithms performed inferrer to densityCut With PAM and OPTICS per—
formed second and third with average silhouette widths of 0.548
and 0.539, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S8(m, k)).

3.3 Clustering single—cell gene expression datasets

We used densityCut to cluster two single—cell mRNA gene expres—
sion datasets. The first dataset consists of the low—coverage mRNA
expression of 23 730 genes in 301 cells from 11 populations (Pollen
et (11., 2014). The second dataset consists of the single—cell mRNA
expression of 43 309 genes in 223 stem cells from the subventricular
zone of eight—week—old male mice (Llorens—Bobadilla et (11., 2015).
We did several pre—processing steps to only select a subset of genes
(Pollen et (11., 2014) for clustering analysis because the high tech—
nique noise in single—cell gene expression data (e.g. loss of cDNA in
reverse transcription and bias in cDNA amplification) and Knn
search in high dimensional spaces is still time—consuming.
Specifically, we only kept the genes expressed in more than five cells
because it is difficult to detect clusters less than five in size given the
relatively large number of cells. Here, a gene was considered to be
expressed in a cell if its reads per kilobase per million (RPKM) value
(or fragments per kilobase per million (FPKM) value for dataset two
(Llorens—Bobadilla et (11., 2015)) was greater than or equal to one in
the cell. We then further normalized the RPKM values by log trans—
formation: logz (x + 1). Here, x was the original RPKM value of a
gene in a cell. A small value of one was added to prevent taking the
log of zero or generating very small numbers.

Figure 4(a) shows that densityCut produced nine clusters for
dataset one (MMM: 0.917, NMI: 0.953 and ARI: 0.918).
densityCut cannot distinguish the cells from GW16, GW21 and
GW21.2 based on the 1000 genes. These cells were quite similar as
they were all from the human cortex (GW16 cells were from the ger—
minal zone of human cortex at gestational week 16, GW21 cells
were from GW21 and GW21.2 cells were cultured cells of a subset
of the GW21 cells (Pollen et (11., 2014)). These cells could possibly
be separated by selecting a better set of features for clustering ana—
lysis. In addition, one GW21 cell was misclassified as a neural pro—
genitor cell (NPC), and one NPC was in the human—induced
pluripotent stem (iPS) cell cluster. For the other seven types of cells,
densityCut perfectly put them into separate clusters. Supplementary
Figure S12 shows the hierarchical cluster trees and the cluster num—
ber frequency plots. Other clustering algorithms such as OPTICS,
PAM, HC, NCut and GMM had inferior performance compared to
densityCut results with PAM ranked second with MMM, NMI and
ARI of 0.877, 0.916 and 0.854, respectively (Supplementary Fig.
S13(a)). densityCut grouped the 223 stem cells of dataset two into
four clusters (Fig. 4(b)). Glutamate aspartate transporterT/
Prominin1T (GP) cells and polysialylated—neural cell adhesion
molecule+(PSA) cells were in separate clusters (except for one PSA

with the original finding that the GP cells consisted of at least three
subtypes of stem cells. We next used t—SNE (Van der Maaten et (11.,
2008) to project the 1000—dimensional single—cell gene expression
data to a two—dimensional space (Supplementary Fig. S14). The re—
sults also show four very distinct clusters. Compared with the ori—
ginal analysis using hierarchical clustering coupled With principle
component analysis feature section (Llorens—Bobadilla et (11., 2015),
densityCut can be used in a more unbiased way to cluster single—
cell gene expression data and produce the same results. On this
dataset, densityCut, PAM, HC and GMM results had average sil—
houette widths of 0.190, 0.190, 0.191 and 0.189, respectively
(Supplementary Fig. S13(b))

3.4 Clustering single—cell mass cytometry datasets
Finally, we used densityCut to cluster two benchmark single—cell
mass cytometry (aka CyTOF) datasets (Levine et (11., 2015). The first
dataset consists of CyTOF data of bone marrow mononuclear cells
from a healthy individual. Manually gating assigned 81 747 cells to
24 cell types based on 13 measured surface protein markers (Bendall
et (11., 2011). Dataset two contains CyTOF data from two healthy
adult donors H1 and H2. For H1, manual gating assigned 72 463
cells to 14 cell types based on 32 measured surface protein markers.
Manual gating assigned 31 721 cells to the same 14 cell populations
from H2 based on the 32 surface protein markers. These manually
identified cell populations were used as ground truth to test
densityCut.

We compared densityCut to the recently proposed algorithm, the
PhenoGraph algorithm (Levine et (11., 2015 ), in clustering the bench—
mark single—cell CyTOF datasets. As both densityCut and

PhenoGraph clustering results

PhenoGraph first build a Knn graph, we used the same K : logz (N)
for both algorithms. As can be seen from Figure 5, densityCut de—
tected 12 distinct cell types (clusters) in dataset one, 9 cell types in
H1, and 12 cell types in H2 (the hierarchical clustering trees and the
cluster number frequency plots are in Supplementary Fig. S15). The
PhenoGraph algorithm detected 18, 24 and 20 clusters in dataset
one, H1 and H2, respectively. Based on MMM, NMI and ARI,
densityCut performed slightly worse on dataset one (MMM: 0.879
versus 0.883, NMI: 0.878 versus 0.900 and ARI: 0.857 versus 0.
893), but performed better on H1 (MMM: 0.941 versus 0.682,
AMI: 0.935 versus 0.833 and ARI: 0.96 versus 0.669) and H2
(MMM: 0.953 versus 0.67, NMI: 0.945 versus 0.829 and ARI: 0.
977 versus 0.638). As for efficiency, densityCut was around
two times faster than PhenoGraph based on the current implemen—
tations (Supplementary Fig. S16). Other clustering algorithms such
as PAM, HC, NCut and GMM are not scalable to these relatively
large datasets. For example, we can only run OPTICS on the
first dataset (OPTICS took about 17minutes while densityCut took
only 24 s).

4 Conclusions and discussion

We developed densityCut, a simple and efficient clustering algo—
rithm. densityCut effectively clustered irregular shape synthetic
benchmark datasets. We have successfully used densityCut to cluster
variant allele frequencies of somatic mutations, single—cell gene ex—
pression data and single—cell CyTOF data. densityCut is based on
density estimation on graphs. It could be considered as a variation
of the spectral clustering algorithms but is much more time— and
space—efficient. Moreover, it automatically selects the number of
clusters and works for the datasets with a large number of clusters.
In summary, densityCut does not make assumptions about the
shape, size and the number of clusters, and can be broadly applic—
able for exploratory data analysis.

A recent study has shown that current strategies for whole gen—
ome sequencing studies missed many somatic mutations (Griffith
et al., 2015). By increasing the sequencing depths from 30>< in their
original study (Ding et al., 2012) to 300>< and using a consensus of
somatic single nucleotide variant (SNV) callers, the number of iden—
tified SNVs increased from 118 to 1343. Based on the 1343 SNVs,
they identified two extra sub—clones (Griffith et al., 2015).
Moreover, an additional 2500 SNVs were highly likely to be genuine
somatic SNVs but still without enough evidence even at 300 X cover—
age. For more complex genomes such as melanoma and breast can—
cer genomes, the number of SNVs could be much larger. Therefore,
efficient algorithms such as densityCut are necessary to infer the clo—
nal structures in individual tumours as more genomes are sequenced
at higher coverage in the near future.

In recent years, single—cell techniques have empowered scientists
to investigate cellular heterogeneity. Computational tools are neces—
sary to analyze these single—cell measurements with high dimension—
ality and large numbers of cells. Efficient algorithms such as
densityCut whose computational complexities are independent of
the dimensionality of data, and can cluster millions of points in a
few minutes can be valuable tools to process these datasets to distill
single cell biology.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Discovering drug’s Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical
(ATC) classification rules at molecular level is of vital importance to
understand a vast majority of drugs action. However, few studies
attempt to annotate drug’s potential ATC-codes by computational
approaches.

Results: Here, we introduce drug-target network to computationally
predict drug’s ATC-codes and propose a novel method named
NetPredATC. Starting from the assumption that drugs with similar
chemical structures or target proteins share common ATC-codes,
our method, NetPredATC, aims to assign drug’s potential ATC-
codes by integrating chemical structures and target proteins.
Specifically, we first construct a gold-standard positive dataset from
drugs’ ATC-code annotation databases. Then we characterize ATC-
code and drug by their similarity profiles and define kernel function to
correlate them. Finally, we use a kernel method, support vector
machine, to automatically predict drug’s ATC-codes. Our method
was validated on four drug datasets with various target proteins,
including enzymes, ion channels, G-protein couple receptors and
nuclear receptors. We found that both drug’s chemical structure
and target protein are predictive, and target protein information has
better accuracy. Further integrating these two data sources revealed
more experimentally validated ATC-codes for drugs. We extensively
compared our NetPredATC with SuperPred, which is a chemical
similarity-only based method. Experimental results showed that our
NetPredATC outperforms SuperPred not only in predictive coverage
but also in accuracy. In addition, database search and functional
annotation analysis support that our novel predictions are worthy of
future experimental validation.

Conclusion: In conclusion, our new method, NetPredATC, can predict
drug’s ATC-codes more accurately by incorporating drug-target
network and integrating data, which will promote drug mechanism
understanding and drug repositioning and discovery.

1 INTRODUCTION

The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classiﬁcation
system categorizes drug substances at different levels by their
therapeutic properties, chemical properties, pharmacological
properties and practical applications. This classiﬁcation system
is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), and
drug’s ATC-codes have been widely applied in almost all drug
utilization studies (WHO, 2006). Speciﬁcally, ATC classiﬁcation
system can be used as a basic tool for drug utilization research.
It also provides the presentation and comparison of drug
consumption statistics at international level and will greatly fa-
cilitate the recent drug repositioning and drug combination stu-
dies. Though useful, mapping ATC-codes to drugs is challenging.

Recently, ATC-codes for some well-characterized drugs have
been deposited in databases, such as Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Biomolecular Relations in
Information Transmission and Expression (BRITE) (Kanehisa
et al., 2006) and DrugBank (W ishart et al., 2008). These databases
provide high quality expert curated data. However, they are in
small scale, and the coverage is far from enough to serve practical
usage. Even for some well-collected drug datasets, the ATC-code
assignments for drugs are far from complete. For example, the
dataset in Yamanishi et a]. (2008) contains drugs with four dif-
ferent type target proteins including enzymes, ion channels (ICs),
G—protein couple receptors (GPCRs) and nuclear receptors
(NRs). These drugs all have manually curated target proteins
from KEGG BRITE (Kanehisa et al., 2006), BRENDA
(Schomburg et al., 2004), SuperTarget (Gunther et al., 2008)
and DrugBank (Wishart et al., 2008). Even in this high-quality
dataset, there are 102 drugs that do not have any ATC-codes in
all 445 drugs targeting enzyme, 13 drugs that do not have
any ATC-codes in all 210 drugs targeting IC, 23 drugs that
do not have any ATC-codes in all 223 drugs targeting GPCR,
and 4 drugs that do not have any ATC-codes in all 54 drugs
targeting NR. The percentage of drugs without ATC codes
varies from 10 to 25%.

The bottleneck is that current data collection procedure heav-
ily relies on human curation and is not efﬁcient. One way out is
to learn the underlying ATC classiﬁcation rules from the avail-
able high quality ATC-code annotations, and further automat-
ically assign new ATC-codes to drugs by a computational
predictor. This strategy will accelerate the functional character-
ization of drugs under the ATC classiﬁcation systems, especially
those barely characterized drugs. Importantly, it will greatly
speed up the mechanism understanding of a vast majority of

drugs action and narrow down the gap between the medical in-
dications and drug effects elucidation at molecular level (Dunkel
et al., 2008).

However, few studies attempt to address this important prob-
lem. Dunkel et a]. tackled this challenge by proposing a compu-
tational method to classify the given compounds into ATC
classiﬁcation system. Their method is based on the drug similar-
ity in chemical structures and physicochemical properties
(Dunkel et al., 2008). They also developed a useful web-server,
which allows prognoses about the medical indication of novel
compounds and to ﬁnd new leads for known targets (Dunkel
et al., 2008). Nevertheless, the chemical structure only describes
the static state of drugs. Cells use proteins and small molecules
(drugs, metabolites, or ligands) networks to dynamically coord-
inate multiple biological functions. For instance, single drug may
possess different biological functions by targeting different pro-
teins. Therefore, if the drug target information is integrated into
the prediction, the performance improvement can be expected.
In this article, we follow this idea to design a new predictive
method. That is, we map ATC-codes to a given drug based
not only on its chemical structure similarity with other com-
pounds but also on its target proteins.

The commonly accepted assumption in drug discovery is that
drugs with similar pharmacological or therapeutic properties usu-
ally share common functions (Wang et al., 2010; Yamanishi et al.,
2008, 2010; Zhao and Li, 2010). Existing efforts demonstrated
that chemical structure similarity is useful in classifying com-
pounds into ATC classiﬁcation system (Dunkel et al., 2008).
Here, we note that drug’s pharmacological or therapeutic similar-
ity may due to the fact that they interact with common or similar
target proteins. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that drugs similar
in target proteins usually share common ATC-codes. Starting
with this assumption, we propose a novel computational
approach called NetPredATC to predict potential ATC-codes
for drugs. Speciﬁcally, we first construct the drug and ATC-
code interaction network based on the known drug ATC-code
annotations. Then we characterize ATC-code and drug by their
similarity proﬁles and define kernel function to correlate drug
with ATC-code. Finally, we infer drug’s ATC-codes by training
a machine-learning model, i.e. support vector machines (SVMs).
SVMs are motivated by statistical learning theory and have been

successful on many different classiﬁcation problems in bioinfor-
matics (Scholkopf et al., 2004). Our contributions here are not
only in incorporating drug targets information for the ﬁrst time
into the ATC-code prediction but also in designing a novel pre-
dictive model by data integration.

The performance of our method was validated on four classes
of drug target proteins, including enzymes, ICs, GPCRs and
NRs. We show that both chemical structure and target protein
are predictive Via cross-validation experiments and statistical
evaluation. Moreover, target protein information is more power-
ful. By combining them, our method outperforms the chemical
similarity-only based method, and more experimentally observed
drug ATC-code annotations can be uncovered.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

We propose a novel computational algorithm, NetPredATC, to infer
drug’s ATC-codes by using drug-target network information. Our algo-
rithm works in three phases (Fig. 1): (i) Formulating known drug’s
ATC annotations as a bipartite graph. We extracted the known drug’s
ATC annotations from KEGG BRITE (Kanehisa et al., 2006) and
DrugBank (Wishart et al., 2008) databases. (ii) Extracting drugwlrug
and ATC-codeATC-code similarity metrics. Drug similarity is derived
from chemical structure and target protein information. ATC-code
similarity proﬁles are calculated by a probabilistic-based model (Lin,
1998). (iii) Feeding the similarities among drugs and similarities among
ATC-codes to kernel method and applying SVM-based classiﬁer to
predict drug’s unknown ATC-codes.

2.1 Constructing drug and ATC-codes interaction
network

In ATC system, drugs are divided into 14 main groups (ﬁrst level), with
one pharmacological/theraputic subgroup (second level). The third and
forth levels are chemical/pharrnacological/theraputic subgroups, and
the ﬁfth level is the chemical substance. The hierarchical structure of
ATC-codes makes the prediction a hierarchical multi-label classiﬁcation
problem. Existing models for this problem are complicated and expensive
in computational cost (Cai and Hofmann, 2004; Rousu et al., 2006). This,
thus, greatly restricts the application scope of such methods. Here, we pro-
pose a low cost computational method by treating ATC-code prediction
problem as a binary classiﬁcation problem. Specifically, we construct
drug and ATC-code interaction network based on available drug’s
ATC annotations, which are extracted from KEGG BRITE (Kanehisa

et al., 2006) and DrugBank (Wishart et al., 2008) databases. That is, by
using the known ATC-codes for drugs, we construct a bipartite graph
(Fig. 1A), i.e. the interactions only exist between drugs and ATC-codes.
In this way drug’s ATC-code prediction can be cast as a binary
classiﬁcation problem. We aim to determine whether a given drug and
ATC-code pair interacts. The advantage is that we can use a much popu-
lar machine-learning method, SVM, to handle this high-dimensional
learning problem in a relatively low cost way.

2.2 Collecting chemical structure and target protein data

Given two drug ATC-code pairs, we construct a kernel function, which
correlates with their similarity. As kernel function represents the simila-
rities among the training samples in some sense (Hofmann et al., 2008),
we focus on the similarity scores among drugs and similarity scores
among ATC-codes. Therefore, we construct the similarity proﬁles to
characterize drug and ATC-code in the following subsections.

2.2.] Chemical structure data It is generally believed that drugs with
similar chemical structures carry out common therapeutic function and
thus likely share common ATC-codes. Therefore, each drug can be char-
acterized by its chemical structure similarity proﬁle with other drugs. The
chemical structure similarity between two drugs d and d’ is computed by
SIMilar COMPound (SIMCOMP) algorithm (Hattori et al., 2003), which
is a graph-based method for comparing pairwise chemical structures.
Suppose that we have n, drugs in total, a matrix Schem e Rncx"c is then
constructed to represent chemical structure similarity. Each row (or col-
umn) of this matrix is chemical structure similarity proﬁle for a single drug.

2.2.2 Target proteins Our previous drug-target prediction suggests
that drugs with common protein targets often have similar therapeutic
function (Wang et al., 2010, 2011). Thus, drugs interacting with the
same targets are likely to share common ATC-codes. Therefore, here,
we fully take advantage of this feature to represent drugs by its similarity
proﬁle in target proteins with other drugs.

Given two drugs d and d’, the similarity between them is calculated
as follows:

sim(d, d’) = max

sim -, - l
greTMLg/ETKW) (g! g!) ( )

where T(d) and T(d’) are the sets of target proteins. The sequence data
are applied to measure protein similarity owing to the rapidly developed
sequencing techniques. The sequence similarities among proteins are
deﬁned by a normalized version of Smith-Waterman scores (Smith and
Waterman, 1981). Suppose that we have n, drugs in total, a matrix
Sim, e Rncx"c is then constructed to represent target protein similarity.
Each row (or column) of this matrix is target protein similarity proﬁle for
a single drug.

2.2.3 ATC-code annotations KEGG BRITE (Kanehisa et al., 2006)
and DrugBank (Wishart et al., 2008) databases deposited thousands of
chemical compounds with detailed ATC annotations. Considering the
hierarchical structure of ATC-codes, a probabilistic model (Lin, 1998)
is introduced to calculate the similarity. Speciﬁcally, the similarity be-
tween two ATC-oodes (t,- and tj) is calculated as follows:

Sl'm(ti, tj) = W(ti)W(tj) exp(-rd(ti, t1)) (2)

where d(t,-, tj) is the shortest distance between ATC-codes t,- and tj in the
hierarchical structure of the ATC classiﬁcation system, w(t,—) and w(tj)
represent the weights of the corresponding ATC-codes, and are deﬁned
as the inverse of ATC-code frequencies, which means that more emphasis
was put on speciﬁc codes rather than the general ones (Y amanishi et al.,
2010). y is a pre-deﬁned parameter (set to be 0.25 in this study). S ATC is
used to denote the resulting drug therapeutic similarity matrix. Each
row (or column) of this matrix is the similarity proﬁle for a single
ATC-code.

2.3 Kernel function for SVM-based predictor and
data integration

With the representation of drugs and ATC-codes by their similarity
proﬁles, the kernel function for two drug and ATC-code pairs dAtA
and dBtB can be calculated as follows:

K(dAtA, 40303) = SL'omp(dAadB) X SATCUA, [3) (3)

where Scam], can be S,,hem(dA,dB), S,,,,L.,(dA,dB) or their combination.
In this article, Chem denotes the case when Scam], = Schem, Inter denotes
the case when Scam], 2 mm, and ChemInter denotes the case when
Scam], =max(SL,hL.m,S,-,,,L.,). Taken together, the rationale behind our
kernel function for drug and ATC-code pairs is that two drug ATC-
code pairs are similar only when the corresponding drugs and ATC-
codes are simultaneously similar supported by different data sources.

2.4 Predicting drug and ATC-code interactions by the
deﬁned kernel function

With the aforementioned kernel function construction scheme, the ATC-
code prediction task is formulated as a classiﬁcation problem by feeding
the kernel function to SVM. If we treat all drug ATC-code pairs with
known interactions as the training positive samples, and others as the
training negative samples, the training data imbalance problem will arise,
as there are only a relatively small number of known drug and ATC-code
interactions. This will make the SVM ineffective in determining the
class boundary (Wu and Chang, 2003). To maintain a balance between
positive and negative datasets in SVM training procedure, we randomly
select a negative dataset from the unlabeled drug ATC-code pairs with
almost the same size as the positive dataset.

As the kernel function (3) and training dataset are feeding to the SVM
learning scheme, the predictor can be calculated by SVM algorithm.

2.5 Benchmark datasets and SVM implementation

The benchmark drug datasets, used to test the performance of our meth-
od, contain four types of target proteins, i.e. enzymes, ICs, GPCRs and
NRs (Yamanishi et al., 2008). The statistics for these four drug-target
interaction networks are summarized in Yamanishi et al., 2008.

Speciﬁcally, the numbers of drugs with known ATC-codes are 343,
197, 200 and 50, which interact with enzymes, ICs, GPCRs and NRs,
respectively. The numbers of corresponding target proteins are 617, 201,
92 and 25 for enzymes, ICs, GPCRs and NRs, respectively. The numbers
of drug-target interactions are 2280, 1422, S93 and 86 in four datasets,
respectively. The numbers of corresponding drugiATC-code interactions
are 492, 281, 300 and 95 in four datasets (see Supplementary Table SI for
details).

We train the SVM-based predictor by using LibSVM (Chang and Lin,
2011). To evaluate the performance of our methods, we use 10-fold cross-
validation. In our implementation, the penalty parameter C is optimized
by the grid search approach with 3-fold cross-validation, and the optimal
value of C is 1. The performance of our proposed method is shown by
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (Gribskov and Robinson,
1996), which illustrates the trade-off between the true positive (correctly
predicted interactions) rate with respect to the false positive (wrongly
predicted interactions) rate. Furthermore, the evaluation criteria, area

3 RESULTS
3.1 Proof-of—concept example for the motivation of
NetPredATC

In this subsection, we explain the motivation of NetPredATC by
a simple example. Drug D02070, annotated with ‘Homatropine
methylbromide’, is an anticholinergic medication that inhibits
muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and thus the parasympathetic
nervous system. Drug D01297, annotated with ‘Pirenzepine’, is
used in the treatment of peptic ulcers, as it reduces gastric acid
secretion and reduces muscle spasm. It is in a class of drugs
known as muscarinic receptor antagonists-acetylcholine, which
serves the neurotransmitter of the parasympathetic nervous
system to initiate the rest-and-digest state (as opposed to ﬁght-
or-ﬂight). The chemical structures of D02070 and D01297 in 2D
space are shown in Figure 2. The structure similarity between
D02070 and D01297 based on SIMCOMP algorithm is ~0.25,
which is relatively low (In the online chemical similarity search
tool http://www.genome.jp/tools/simcomp/, the similar com-
pound will be listed only when the SIMCOMP score is larger
than 0.4). This indicates that two drugs are not similar in struc-
ture at all. The dissimilar structure thus fails the chemical struc-
ture-only based prediction algorithm. However, these two drugs
share one common target: ‘Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor
Ml’ (HSA: 1128), which agrees with the therapeutic explanations
of these two drugs. Moreover, these two drugs share a common
ATC-code: A02BX03, annotated with ‘pirenzepine’. This is the
same as the annotation of drug D01297. Taken together, two

Fig. 2. The motivation of our NetPredATC is illustrated by a proof-of-
concept example. Chemical structure similarity between D02070 and
D01297 is 0.25, which is relatively low and indicates that two drugs are
not similar in structure. However, these dissimilar drugs share the
common protein target: Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. Moreover,
they share the common ATC code: A02BX03. Therefore, two drugs
dissimilar in chemical structure share common ATC-code (A02BX03)
owing to the evidence that they interact with common target protein
(‘Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1’)

drugs dissimilar in chemical structure share common ATC-
code (A02BX03) owing to the fact that they interact with
common target protein (‘Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor
Ml’). This example demonstrates that drug-target interactions,
introduced in our method for the first time, can help us to infer
drug’s ATC-codes. It is particularly useful when chemical struc-
ture information is insufﬁcient. Furthermore, the improvement
can be expected by combination of these two important infor-
mation sources.

3.2 Correlation analysis shows the usefulness of chemical
structure and drug-target interactions

We collect two data sources to depict drugs: chemical structure
and target proteins. As the first step, we confirm each data
source is predictive to ATC-codes, i.e. drugs with similar struc-
tures or target proteins tend to be annotated with similar ATC-
codes. To show this, we correlate chemical structure similarity
and target proteins similarity with ATC-code similarity, respect-
ively. The ATC-codes similarity is calculated by the maximal
ATC-code similarities for multiple annotations (Zhao and Li,
2010).

Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcients (PCCs) between chemical
structure, drug-target network similarity and ATC-code similar-
ity are shown in Figure 3. Besides all drug pairs, we also draw
the PCCs between chemical structure similarity, target protein
similarity and ATC-code similarity among drug pairs when their
chemical structure similarity and target protein similarity larger
than 0.5 and 0.8. Figure 3 demonstrates that, on all four datasets,
PCCs are increasing when the drug similarities increase. Both
PCCs from chemical structure similarity and target protein simi-
larity reach their largest values when drug similarities are larger
than 0.8. In addition, PCCs between chemical structure similarity
and target protein similarity are larger than 0.4 for all the four
datasets. The PCCs between target protein similarity and ATC-
code similarity are consistently larger than that between-chemical
structure similarity and ATC-code similarity. That is, both
chemical structure similarity and target protein similarity
correlate with the ATC-code similarity signiﬁcantly, and, more-
over, ATC-code similarity correlates better with target protein
similarity.

In addition, we correlate the similarities obtained from two
data sources with the topology parameters of the known drug
and ATC-code interaction network. We deﬁne two drugs’ dis-
tance in the network as the length of their shortest path in the
drug and ATC-code interaction network. We plot the

distributions of chemical structure and target protein similarity
scores with respect to drugs’ distance in enzyme, ICs, GPCRs
and NRs networks, respectively, in Supplementary Figure S1. As
the similarity scores are close to zeroes when the corresponding
distances are larger than 2 for all four datasets, we only show the
similarity distributions with respect to ‘distance 2’ group in
Supplementary Figure S1, which means that we focus on the
drugs with common ATC-codes.

Supplementary Figure S1 shows that both chemical structure
similarity and target protein similarity are larger than 0.8 for
about ~75% drug pairs sharing common ATC-codes. That is,
two drugs sharing common ATC-codes tend to have larger
chemical structure and target protein similarities. It suggests
that drug pairs with similar chemical structure, or target protein,
tend to be annotated with the same ATC-code. Thus, both chem-
ical structures and target proteins are predictive for ATC-code
annotation. In addition, the number of drug pairs with high
target protein similarity (>0.8) are more than the number of
drug pairs with high chemical structure similarity (>0.8) when
counting in all drug pairs with common ATC-code. This fact
indicates that the drugs with common ATC-code tend to have
target protein similarity than chemical structure similarity, and
target protein information may have better coverage in ATC-
code prediction.

3.3 Drug-target interactions are more predictable than
chemical structures in ATC-code prediction

In this subsection, we compare the usefulness of chemical struc-
tures and target proteins in ATC-code prediction. The perform-
ance is evaluated and visualized by ROC curves (Gribskov and
Robinson, 1996). We note that the training negative dataset is
constructed only in the training process, and the validation is
done with the assumption that all non-interacting drug ATC-
code pairs are negative examples.

First, we show the performance of chemical structure and
target protein in uncovering the experimentally observed drug
and ATC-code interactions. We replace the drug similarity
matrix Scamp in kernel function (3) with Schem and Smm, respect-
ively. The ROC curves obtained by chemical structure and target
proteins are drawn in Figure 4. The corresponding evaluation
criteria, AUC, Acc, Sn, Sp and Pre are listed in Table 1 when the
corresponding F-measure reaches its maximum.

From Figure 4 and Table l, we can see that Chem obtains
AUC score beyond 0.78 on all four datasets. That is, chemical
structure is useful in ATC-code prediction. Moreover, target pro-
tein plays a more important role in predicting drug’s ATC-codes.

Roe cums: to:

ROC curves: Enzyme

For all four datasets, Inter outperforms Chem with much higher
Acc, Pre and F-measure and obtains ~3% improvement in ac-
curacy. In addition, Inter improves Sn by >2%. This result dem-
onstrates that more experimentally observed ATC-codes of drugs
can be uncovered by applying target proteins to characterize
drug similarity.

All these results suggest that each data source will do one’s
bit to infer drug’s potential ATC-codes. Therefore, combination
of these two data sources should produce a much more sophis-
ticated picture.

3.4 Data integration improves prediction

In the previous subsection, each data source demonstrates its
usefulness in uncovering the experimentally observed drug
ATC-codes. In the following, we validate the effect of combining
the two data sources in predicting drug’s ATC-codes. The
performance of data integration method, ChemInter, is evalu-
ated and visualized by ROC curves (Fig. 4) and other criteria
(Table 1).

Figure 4 shows that, except for NRs dataset, ChemInter
obtains the highest true positive rate when false positive rate
is <0.l. That is, ChemInter can achieve better accuracy when
predicting a small fraction of drug ATC-code interactions.

Table 1 shows that ChemInter performs better than using
single data source for all four datasets. For example in
Enzymes dataset, Chem and Inter make the AUCs 0.805 and
0.836, respectively, whereas ChemInter obtains an AUC 0.841.
For NRs dataset, Chem and Inter obtain Sns 0.715 and 0.736,
respectively, whereas ChemInter obtains an Sn of 0.726, which is
lower than Inter. However, Chem and Inter obtain Pres 0.701
and 0.723, respectively, whereas ChemInter obtains an Sn of
0.775, which is much higher than Inter and Chem. This fact
again demonstrates that chemical structure and target protein
similarity are useful in ATC-code prediction. Their combination
obtains signiﬁcant improvement.

3.5 Comparison with SuperPred

As we mentioned, Duntkel et al. proposed a computational
method to assign drug’s ATC-codes (Dunkel et al., 2008). In
their work, only drug chemical structure was used underlying
the basic assumption that similar compounds belong to the
same ATC-group (Dunkel et al., 2008). To calculate the similar-
ity between two drugs, their structural ﬁngerprints, generated by
Chemistry Development ToolKit (CDK) (http://almost.cubic.
uni-koeln.de/cdk/), were used, and the similarity was determined
by the Tanimoto coefﬁcient. It is similar with SIMCOMP

algorithm (Hattori et al., 2003) used in our implementation,
which is a graph-based method for comparing chemical
structures.

Our NetPredATC is conceptually different with SuperPred by
introducing drug-target network in ATC-code prediction. In
addition, we performed a side-by-side comparison with
SuperPred on predictive results. We found that our method
NetPredATC outperforms SuperPred in terms of accuracy by
considering drug target information. We took the GPCRs data-
set as an example. Specifically, we submitted the drug’s name in
SuperPred server (http://bioinformatics.charite.de/superpred),
got the corresponding ATC-codes and then calculated the
predictive accuracy. As a result, 215 drug ATC-code annotations
have been predicted correctly among the total 300 drug ATC-
code predictions. The accuracy of SuperPred is 0.716. Our
method obtains an accuracy of 0.73 by using protein target in-
formation alone. When integrating the chemical similarity with
target information, our method further improves the accuracy to
0.74. The results again show that target proteins play an import-
ant role in drug’s ATC-code prediction. This provides additional
supports for the efficiency of NetPredATC.

Our accuracy with chemical structure information alone is
0.678 in Table l, which is slightly smaller than SuperPred’s
0.716. This difference arises from the different ways to calculate
drug’s chemical similarity. CDK is better than SIMCOMP owing
to the fact that physiochemical properties are included.

Next, we list some examples to highlight our advantage by
introducing drug target information. We speciﬁcally focus
on the successful predictions by NetPredATC while failed
by SuprePred. By introducing the target information,
NetPredATC correctly identiﬁes 219 drug ATC-codes, and
four of them cannot be predicted by SuperPred. Speciﬁcally,
drug D05740 is annotated by ATC-code N02CC04, drug
D00480 is annotated by ATC-code D04AA10, drug D02884 is
annotated by ATC-code R03DA10 and drug D00059 is anno-
tated by ATC-code N04BA04. We check the data and ﬁnd that
these ATC annotations are borrowed from the drugs with similar
target proteins but dissimilar chemical structures, similar to the

example illustrated in Figure 2. These predictions demonstrate
that our implementation necessitates a clear beneﬁt in replacing
SuperPred.

3.6 Novel predictions

We find that NetPredATC displays its excellent performance in
discovering experimentally observed ATC-codes of drugs. To
test whether it can produce biologically useful predictions, we
focus on the unlabeled drug ATC-code pairs. We trained
NetPredATC on the gold-standard positive dataset and ran-
domly selected negative dataset from the unlabeled pairs and
tested it on the remaining drug ATC-code pairs. Our expectation
is that NetPredATC can discover the missing drugs ATC-codes.
The top ﬁve predicted interactions on Enzyme, ICs, GPCRs and
NRs datasets are listed in Table 2 and Supplementary Tables
S27S4, respectively. For each drug and ATC-code pair in these
tables, we check out their annotation information from
DrugBank (Wishart et al., 2008) and World Health
Organization Collaborating Centres (WHOCC) (http://www.
whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/) databases. We further check the
drug and its ATC-code annotations form Wikipedia (http://en.
Wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) and finally analyzed the reliabil-
ity of predicted ATC-codes.

For Enzyme dataset, D00969 is annotated as ‘Meloxicam’ and
is a non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drug (NSAID) with anal-
gesic and fever reducer effects. M01ABO8, annotated as
‘Etodolac’, belongs to a class of drugs called NSAIDs.
Moreover, the target of D00969 is prostaglandin G/H synthase
2 (HSA:5743), which is also the target of D00315, and D00315
has the ATC-code M01ABO8. Therefore, the relationship be-
tween D00969 and M01ABO8 may exist with high probability.
The descriptions of the remaining four novel predictions are pre-
sented in the Supplementary Material.

The top ﬁve novel predictions on ICs, GPCRs and NRs data-
sets are listed in Supplementary Table S27S4, the explanation of
corresponding predictions is presented in the Supplementary
Material. Database search, literature search and functional anno-
tation analysis support these novel predictions. All these results

drugs. It can provide low-resolution predictive results for further
high-resolution biological experiments.

4 DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSION

In this article, we propose a new computational method,
NetPredATC, to infer drug’s ATC-codes by integrating its chem-
ical structure and target protein data. Our main contributions are
both in characterizing the drug similarity proﬁles by drug-target
network and in constructing data integration model by kernel
method.

Speciﬁcally, we characterize the drug similarity not only form
chemical structures but also from target proteins. By treating
ATC-code prediction as a binary classiﬁcation problem, a
SVM-based predictor is used to uncover unknown ATC-codes
for drugs. The improvement is achieved by incorporating target
protein information on four benchmark datasets. Our method
outperforms the existing chemical structure-only based method
and can accurately uncover more experimentally observed drug
ATC-codes. In addition, the database search and functional an-
notation analysis support our novel predictions. Taken together,
these rigorous validations imply that our method can identify
drugs’ potential ATC-codes in an accurate way.

We improved the predictive performance by characterizing
drugs’ target protein sequence similarity. The improvement is
robust to the deﬁnition of protein sequence similarity. We tried
different cut-offs to measure protein sequence similarity (0.2, 0.3,
0.4 and 0.5). The results are summarized in Supplementary Table
S5 and Supplementary Figure S2. We found that the AUC score
is slightly lower when using a more stringent cut-off, but not too
much. This is because most of sequence similarity among drug
target is actually low in our datasets to avoid obvious predic-
tions. One advantage to introduce target protein information is
to fully use the indirect neighbor information in drug ATC-code
annotation network. It allows us to predict drug’s ATC-code
when this drug has low chemical similarity and target similarity
with its closest drug. We list some novel drug ATC-code predic-
tions with low chemical similarity and target similarity in
Supplementary Table S6.

We further note that there are another ways to define drug
similarity by their protein targets. For example, drugs sharing

common targets are often similar in their side effects (Campillos
et al., 2008) and drugs targeting the same neighbor in network
show similarity in side effects (Brouwers et al., 2011). Therefore,
the closeness of target proteins in proteineprotein interaction
(PPI) network appears to be a good predictor for drug side ef-
fects. Similar to the side effects prediction, drug pairs that have
similar ATC-codes may target the same neighbor in PPI net-
work. Thus, it is necessary to validate the effect of targets neigh-
borhood in ATC-code prediction. That is, we can characterize
drugs by their targets closeness in PPIs network instead of se-
quence-based similarity in future.

The training negative dataset is one key problem in SVM-based
predictor. There is still plenty room for the improvement on the
deﬁnition and selection of the training negative dataset. This is a
formidable challenge to our method and to other interaction pre-
diction methods. Since the available ATC-code annotations for
drugs is far from complete, many unknown drug and ATC-code
pairs may be actually interacting in our task. To deal with this
problem, a linear regression model can be introduced to uncover
the new ATC-codes of drugs, which can avoid the selection of
negative dataset. Speciﬁcally, the chemical structures and target
proteins are used to characterize the drug similarity proﬁles, and
then a linear regression model can be applied to correlate the
ATC-code similarity with drug similarity. The similar ideas
have been used to prioritize the disease genes (Jiang et al., 2011;
Wu et al., 2008). In addition, our NetPredATC was validated on
four relatively small benchmark datasets. The larger the dataset is,
the more knowledge can be learned to construct classiﬁer, and
results are generally more reliable.

Importantly, we provide a general framework to perform data
integration, and our framework is ready to be applied to another
drug-related studies. For example, our method can be applied in
side effects prediction, which is a critical stage in drug develop-
ment. One can assess the similarity among the side effects by
some text mining approaches and deﬁne the drug similarity by
their chemical structures, target proteins or ATC-codes (Zhao
and Li, 2010). In almost similar manner, our method can predict
novel drugwlisease relationships, which is also known as drug
repositioning.

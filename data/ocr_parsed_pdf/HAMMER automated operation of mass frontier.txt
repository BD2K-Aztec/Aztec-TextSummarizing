HAMMER

 

experimental fragmentation spectrum and an in silico
fragmentation pattern in a library (Ye et al., 2010). The
pMatch algorithm is a spectral matching algorithm origin—
ally developed for mass spectrometry—based protein iden—
tiﬁcation (see Supplementary Information for details of
the algorithm). The SpectralMatching module uses MSP
ﬁles (see previous module), experimental and in silico, as its
input. For each experimental fragmentation spectrum, a
report is generated, which includes detailed information
on the matching and annotation.

3 CASESTUDES

HAMMER was used to generate in silico fragmentation data for
two distinct groups of compounds: (i) all 72 metabolites within
the ‘phenylalanine metabolism’ KEGG pathway (i.e. map00360)
and (ii) the top 200 most prescribed drugs in the USA in 2011
(RxList, 2011). These were selected to demonstrate the applic—
ability and capability of HAMMER across diverse compound
sets. Some drugs are composed of multiple compounds, and each
compound was separately parsed and imported into Mass
Frontier. Additionally, lower mass neutral and charged mol—
ecules/atoms (e.g. water and sodium) within these separated
drug compounds were excluded from this demonstration dataset
(see Supplementary Information for details). This resulted in 151
unique structures for the drugs dataset. See Supplementary Table
S1 for speciﬁc settings used for both case studies. The run times
for the phenylalanine and drug datasets were ~8.5 and 14.5 h,
respectively. On average, ~3200 fragments were predicted for
each compound (see Supplementary Tables S27S4). Applying
the deﬁned Mass Frontier parameter settings, it is expected
that MS" data are reported, where n>2. This relatively high
number of fragments illustrates the complexity and diversity of
the fragmentation mechanisms. Although, these in silica frag—
ments are predicted based on a set of general fragmentation
rules and a fragmentation library comprising ~150 000 fragmen—
tation mechanisms collected from the scientiﬁc literature, the
numbers of fragments produced are highly dependent on the
complexity of the chemical structures and the parameter settings
defined by the user (see Supplementary Information and online
manual for details). In silica fragments may be reported, which
are false positives; these fragments are not actually created in the
MS fragmentation process, or are created but their low stabilities
ensure that further and complete fragmentation or decompos—
ition is observed before the ions are detected.

To assess the applicability of each in silica fragmentation li—
brary, ﬁve experimental fragmentation mass spectra were retrieved
from MassBank to perform spectral matching [Supplementary
Table S5, Case Study I: acetyl—CoA (KNA00207), capsaicin
(W A00 1 605), isobutyryl—CoA (PR 1 001 54), N—acetyl—L—
phenylalanine (K0002200) and succinic acid (K2000074). Case
study II: amoxicillin (WA001751), digoxin (WA000563), meloxi—
cam (WA002576), naproxen (WA000359) and prednisone
(C0000368)] (Horai et al., 2010). All of the 10 real fragmentation

spectra were correctly identiﬁed based on the data present in these
small in silica mass spectral libraries (Supplementary Table S6).

It is important to highlight that the parameter settings used
in Mass Frontier to perform in silica fragmentation play an im—
portant role in the correct prediction of in silica fragments and
mechanisms. Additionally, understanding the experimental par—
ameters used to collect experimental data (e. g. difference in
collision energy or type of fragmentation) is also important to
maximize metabolite annotation. However, these two challenges
are outside the scope of the work presented here.

Both case studies show that HAMMER allows researchers to
readily generate in silica MSn libraries and perform batch spec—
tral matching of in silica mass spectral data to MS—derived data
in an automated high—throughput fashion with minimal or no
human intervention. In addition, we have shown with both case
studies the value and applicability of visual scripting in the ﬁeld
of computational biology. We anticipate this software package
will be used across a wide range of disciplines including metabo—
lomics, organic synthetic chemistry and pharmaceutical research.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: New bioimaging techniques have recently been proposed
to visualize the colocation or interaction of several proteins within in-
dividual cells, displaying the heterogeneity of neighbouring cells within
the same tissue specimen. Such techniques could hold the key to
understanding complex biological systems such as the protein inter-
actions involved in cancer. However, there is a need for new algorith-
mic approaches that analyze the large amounts of multi-tag bioimage
data from cancerous and normal tissue specimens to begin to infer
protein networks and unravel the cellular heterogeneity at a molecular
level.

Results: The proposed approach analyzes cell phenotypes in normal
and cancerous colon tissue imaged using the robotically controlled
Toponome Imaging System microscope. It involves segmenting the
4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoIe-Iabelled image into cells and determin-
ing the cell phenotypes according to their protein—protein dependence
profile. These were analyzed using two new measures, Difference
in Sums of Weighted c0-dependence/Anti-co-dependence profiles
(DiSWOP and DiSWAP) for overall co-expression and anti-co-expres-
sion, respectively. These novel quantities were extracted using 11
Toponome Imaging System image stacks from either cancerous or
normal human colorectal specimens. This approach enables one to
easily identify protein pairs that have significantly higher/lower co-
expression levels in cancerous tissue samples when compared with
normal colon tissue.

1 INTRODUCTION

To understand cellular biology on a systems level, relationships
between molecular components must be understood not only at a
functional level but also localized in the spatial domain
(Megason and Fraser, 2007). This is due to the fact that prox-
imity of key proteins provides an indication of the possible

existence of functional protein complexes. As a consequence,
new bioimaging techniques have been recently proposed to Visu-
alize the colocation or interaction of several proteins in cells in
intact tissue specimen. These include Matrix-assisted laser deso-
rption/ionization (MALDI) imaging (Cornett et al., 2007),
Raman microscopy (Van Manen et al., 2005), Toponome
Imaging System (TIS) (Schubert et al., 2006), multi-spectral ima-
ging methods (Barash et al., 2010) and MxIF (Gerdes et al.,
2013). TIS is an automated high-throughput technique able to
co-map up to a 100 different proteins or other tag-recognizable
biomolecules in the same pixel on a single tissue section
(Schubert et al., 2012). It runs cycles of ﬂuorescence tagging,
imaging and soft bleaching in situ. While colocation does not
necessarily imply interaction, it has been consistently found
that clusters containing particular proteins are found in speciﬁc
sub-cellular compartments, hence allowing such a hypothesis to
be generated (Bhattacharya et al., 2010). Also, co-dependence
between two proteins is a potential indication for an interaction
that is not necessarily direct. TIS has a sub-cellular maximum
lateral resolution of 206x 206 nm/pixel (Bhattacharya et al.,
2010), which allows the determination of sub-cellular protein
network architectures. The combination of proteomic informa-
tion with spatial sub-cellular level topographical data has been
termed ‘toponomics’ (Schubert et al., 2003, 2012).

Biomarkers used in current clinical practice are limited to the
simultaneous analysis of only a handful of proteins. Therefore,
they fail to assess the true complexity of cancer, and the resulting
biomarkers have a low prognostic value (V ucic et al., 2012). The
capabilities of the TIS hold promise for developing a new gen-
eration of multiplex biomarkers (Evans et al., 2012), which could
aid the development of personalized medicine. Studying the pro-
tein interactions in cancer could uncover previously unknown
mechanisms of tumour formation and could identify new poten-
tial drug targets in the form of protein interactions.

It has been shown that TIS imaging can be used in cancer
research for protein network mapping (Bhattacharya et al.,
2010). However, there is a need for new algorithmic approaches
that analyze the co-expression patterns. The standard way to
analyze TIS images is to apply a threshold to each image of
the stack and thus reduce it to binary values (Schubert et al.,
2006). However, while this step is straightforward and can be
performed objectively (Barysenka et al., 2010), by reducing the
image to binary, a lot of potentially important information is

lost. Recently, such non-threshold methods have been presented
(Humayun et al., 2011; Langenkamper et al., 2011). These algo-
rithms cluster molecular co-expression patterns on a pixel level
and therefore lose the variation at a cell level. This can be crucial
when analyzing cancerous samples due to the heterogeneity of
cancer cells (V ucic et al., 2012). Furthermore, these algorithms
are based on the raw expression levels, which are intensity de-
pendent and hence may vary between different stacks. A similar
approach is used in the Web-based Hyperbolic Image Data
Explorer (WHIDE) (Kolling et al., 2012), which allows analysis
of the space and colocation using a H2SOM clustering (Ontrup
and Ritter, 2006). Although this tool is effective at identifying
molecular co-expression patterns, the cellular structure is lost,
and hence the method is unable to analyze the different cell
phenotypes that may be present in the samples. More recently,
focus has shifted towards cell-level analysis. One approach is to
use K-median clustering to phenotype-segmented cells (Gerdes
et al., 2013). However, the conclusions in this study about path-
ways in colon cancer were drawn by only Visual inspection of the
phenotypes obtained and without considering any control sam-
ples. In another study (Khan et al., 2013), cells were phenotyped
after dimensionality reduction of their raw expression vector
using t—distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (Van der
Maaten and Hinton, 2008).

In this article, a new approach is proposed where the proteini
protein dependence proﬁle (PPDP) is considered instead of the
raw protein expression proﬁles. There has been evidence in the
literature that despite the spherical and the exploratory cell states
of rhabdomyosarcoma cells having identical average protein pro-
ﬁles, striking differences were found between the two states at the
sub-cellular protein cluster level (Schubert, 2010). Hence, re-
arrangement, rather than up- or downregulation of proteins, is
(or can be) the key to generating new cell functionalities
(Schubert et al., 2012). This shows the importance of co-depend-
ence of proteins rather than abundance on its own. Furthermore,
we perform the analysis at cell level rather than pixel level, allow-
ing for the cells to be phenotyped according to their PPDP. This
enables us to gain a better understanding of the heterogeneity
within the cancer cell population. Finally, two new measures are
proposed to enable us to infer small-scale protein networks.
These new measures highlight protein pairs that have different
interaction in cancer and normal tissues and, hence, can be used
as biomarkers to distinguish between different types of samples
using protein co-dependence. To our knowledge, this is the
ﬁrst study of localized protein networks performed using multi-
labelling imaging techniques. An overview of the approach is
presented in Figure 1. Applying it to synthetically generated
data gave the expected results, giving conﬁdence in the new
measures.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data and pre-processing

The image data used in this study were acquired using a TIS micro-
scope (Schubert et al., 2006) installed at the University of Warwick.
Samples had been surgically removed from colon cancer patients. One
sample was taken from the surface of the tumour mass, and another
one was selected from apparently healthy colonic mucosa at least
10cm away from the visible margin of the tumour. Two visual ﬁelds

were manually selected in each tissue sample, resulting in four TIS
datasets from a single patient. The results presented here were obtained
by considering 11 sample546 healthy and S cancerous. A library of 12
antibody tags (see Supplementary Material for a list of criteria on how
these were selected) was used based on recent ﬁndings (Bhattacharya
et al., 2010). Some of the tags are known tumour markers or cancer
stem cell markers. These were CD133, CK19, Cyclin A, Muc2, CEA,
CD166, CD36, CD44, CD57, CK20, Cyclin D1 and EpCAM. The
stacks also included a 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) tag used
to identify the cell nuclei. A previously presented protocol for sample
preparation and image acquisition was used (Bhattacharya et al., 2010).

Background autoﬂuorescence is digitally subtracted at an early stage.
Hence, any remaining ﬂuorescence should be true protein expression. In
each of the stacks, the images were aligned using the RAMTaB (Robust
Alignment of Multi-Tag Bioimages) algorithm (Raza et al., 2012). This is
done to prevent possible noise resulting from the slight misalignment of
the multi-tag images obtained using TIS. This method has been shown to
achieve sub-pixel accuracy of registering these data (Raza et al., 2012).
Then, if there are K tags, each having a corresponding image of size
m x n, the data can be represented as a K x mn matrix:

1 l l

x1,1 x1,2  xm,n
2 2 2
x1,1 x1,2  xm,n
X = . . . . (1)
K
x1 1 x12 xm,n

where j is the expression level of protein k (k<K) at pixel (1,1). In our
experiments, K = 12,m = 1027 and n: 1056.

We recently proposed to perform cell segmentation of TIS stacks to
restrict the analysis to cellular areas only (Khan et al., 2012). This ensures
that signals from stroma and lumen are removed, as they can potentially
add noise to the subsequent analysis. To follow best practice, one should
segment entire cells, as some of the proteins observed are located in parts
of the cells other than the nucleus, such as the cytoplasm, vesicles or the
Golgi apparatus. However, this is challenging in cancerous tissues be-
cause of the variable orientation of cells due to disrupted tissue architec-
ture, and a tag of the cell membrane was not used in this set of
experiments to enable us to precisely identify entire cells. Instead, each
image was segmented using a modiﬁed form of the graph-cut method
(Al-Kofahi et al., 2010) applied to a DAPI channel (Khan et al., 2012).
This was necessary to extract pixel locations of the nuclei and their im-
mediate neighbourhood only, as the DAPI tag stains the DNA. Using

only nuclei may reduce the amount of cell available for analysis, but is
comparatively unambiguous and can be used as a rough approximation
of the cells. Details of the method and examples can be found in the
Supplementary Materials.

Segmentation resulted in 2945 cells being identiﬁed. The cell-localized
protein expression values for each of the K proteins are collected in a
protein expression matrix X, of the order K x N, for each cell c

X. = {th | (U) E 9c} (2)

where S2,. = {(i1,j1), (i2,j2), ..., ([1,,c ,ch)} denotes the set of pixel coordin-
ates in cell c, N, = |S2L.| denotes the number of pixels in each cell c and the
vector X“ = [x1 K

2.2 Protein—protein dependence proﬁle

The pairwise maximal information coefﬁcient (MIC) (Reshef et al., 2011)
for each pair of proteins, localized to an individual cell c, is calculated to
obtain the PPDP of the cell. We used this statistic, as it has been shown to
capture a wide range of associations, both functional and not, and it gives
similar scores to equally noisy relationships of different types (Reshef
et al., 2011). Details of the way it is calculated can be found in the
Supplementary Materials. For each cell c, a K(K — 1)/2-dimensional
vector u, of pairwise MIC scores is obtained. The vector represents the
PPDP of the cell and can be expressed as

My 2 [M232 2,3...MLLK 3,3 3,4...M3a1‘...uleal‘] (4)
where u? E [0, l] is given by the MIC between rows 1' and j of the matrix
X,.. The PPDP for two sample cells from the same tissue specimen is
shown in Figure 2.

Other co-dependence measures were also considered for the analysis.
Pearson and Spearman correlations fail to capture non-linear relation-
ships between protein expression proﬁles, which often occur because of
the inhomogeneous structure of the cells. Mutual information and
normalized mean expression values were also tested. However, each of
these resulted in a batching effect where some phenotypes were predom-
inantly located in a single, usually cancerous, sample (see Section 3 of
Supplementary Materials). This seems biologically unlikely, as we expect
that there should be some normal cells within the tumour tissue and that
cancers share some common types of cells. These ﬁndings are consistent
with the ﬁndings that functionality can be determined by colocation
rather than changes in abundance levels (Schubert, 2010). The analysis
was also performed using distance correlation (Szkely and Rizzo, 2009).
The ﬁnal results obtained were similar to the ones obtained using MIC

(see Supplementary Materials). However, it has been found that the dis-
tance correlation has a strong preference for some types of dependencies
and gives different scores at the same noise levels (Reshef et al., 2011).
Therefore, the MIC is preferred due to its robustness to variations in the
type of dependence.

2.3 Cell phenotyping based on localized PPDP

The vector u, is the PPDP of the cell c and can be used to determine
the cell phenotype using a clustering algorithm. Afﬁnity propagation is a
clustering method, which takes as input a matrix containing measures
of similarity between pairs of data points. Real-valued messages are
passed between data points until a high-quality set of exemplars
and corresponding set of clusters gradually emerges (Frey and Dueck,
2007). We have used a Gaussian kernel based on the Euclidean
distance between the protein co-dependence proﬁles of cells as an
afﬁnity matrix, so for a pair of cells a and b with PPDPs p.“ and
#4,, respectively, the (a, b) entry of the similarity matrix (for a 7e b) is
given by

—Ilua — MHZ) (5)

Sm}, = exp( 202

where a = (maxmbllna — nb||)/3 and H > H is the Euclidean distance. All
diagonal entries of the matrix are set to equal the minimum value of the
matrix. This means that each cell is equally likely to be a cluster centroid
and results in a moderate number of clusters. We denote the number
of cell phenotypes resulting from this approach by C, which, in this in-
stance, was found to be 41. An agglomerative hierarchical clustering (Jain
et al., 1999) and Gaussian Bayesian hierarchical clustering (Kovacheva
et al., 2014; Sirinukunwattana et al., 2013) approaches with the same
number of clusters were also considered. It was encouraging to see that
these gave similar results, which are shown in the Supplementary
Materials.

2.4 Protein—protein co-dependence and
anti-co-dependence measures
Once the cell phenotype clusters have been obtained, an average PPDP
ﬁrs is calculated for each cluster S. For a protein pair (i,j) (with i <1" 5 K)
E's” is given by
Z My

—i,j L'ES
M = 6
5 IS, ( )

 

Then ﬁg is the vector
ﬂs = [1213213 > > 9121,0232?“ > > 144*] (7)
To more objectively investigate the protein pairs that have higher de-
pendency and are more frequent in cancer samples, a difference of
weighted sums was calculated by considering the top N (here set to
equal 5 or 10) dependency scores of the 10 most frequent phenotypes
in each sample. The measure weights the dependency score with the
phenotype probability in the sample, and sums all occurrences of the
protein pair in all the cancerous samples and of all the normal samples.
The sums are normalized by the number of samples. It then subtracts the
score for the normal from the score for the cancer samples, hence giving a
positive score if a pair appears more frequently and with higher depend-
ency scores in the cancerous samples. More formally, if ﬁg is the vector
with the elements of ﬁg (lying in [0, 1]) sorted in descending order, p’S is
the probability of phenotype S in sample r, Sm, is the or’h most frequent
phenotype in sample r, and

Hence, we introduce two new measures called Difference in Sum of
Weighted cO-dependence/Anti-co-dependence proﬁles, further referred to
as DiSWOP [Equation (9)] and DiSWAP [Equation (11)]. Large positive
values of DiSWOP indicate that the protein pair (i, j) is more co-depend-
ent in cancer samples, whereas a low negative DiSWOP value means that
the protein pair is more co-dependent in the normal samples. Similarly
for DiSWAP, a large positive value suggests that the protein pair is more
anti-oo-dependent in cancer, and a large negative value suggests that the
protein pair is more anti-oo-dependent in healthy samples. The DiSWOP
and DiSWAP scores are shown in Figure 3. Various combinations of
number of phenotypes and dependency scores were also considered.
Altering the number of clusters caused little change to the results, as
the phenotypes that were added or excluded have low probability in
the samples. On the other hand, increasing the number of dependency
scores considerably changed the protein pairs highlighted. However, if
more than the top 10 scores are included, the average dependency score
added to the analysis is <0.5, and so the proteins are more anti-oo-
dependent than they are co-dependent. Therefore, these scores should
not be included as part of the DiSWOP measure. Further, biological
validation and analysis of a greater number of samples is needed to de-
termine the optimal number of dependency scores to be considered as
part of the dependency measures.

2.5 Synthetic data

The measures presented above were checked using synthetically generated
data. Details of the algorithm for generating these data can be found in
the Supplementary Materials. Initially, two samples were generated to
correspond to one cancer and one normal tissue samples. The expression
of ﬁve tags was simulated for each of these samples. Each of the samples
contained ~80 cells, which were randomly allocated to two different
phenotypes per sample, with the ﬁrst phenotype containing about one-
third of the cells in the sample and the rest belonging to the second
phenotype. Once the first tag was created, the rest of the tags were
generated by keeping a fraction of the pixels the same as in tag 1 and
assigning a random value to the rest. The fractions of pixels that were
kept the same were as follows:

0.4 0.6 0.7 0.9
0.8 0.9 0.5 0.2

4’”: 0.5 0.2 ’4’": 0.6 0.4 (12)
0.1 0.6 0.7 0.3

where {C gives the similarity in the ‘cancer’ sample and {n in the ‘normal’
sample. Each column corresponds to a different phenotype, with the
smaller phenotype in the sample being determined by the ﬁrst column.

A row j in the matrices in Equation (12) gives the similarity between tag 1
and tag j+ 1. Note that the order of pixels to be kept the same remains
constant for a cell, so, for a phenotype S, the prescribed similarity be-
tween tags i and j (i,j> 1) is given by min({(i + 1, S), {(j+ 1, S)).
Examples of the images obtained for the ‘cancer’ sample are shown in
Figure 4.

A larger simulation was run to test the power of the DiSWOP measure
for discriminating between cancer and normal samples. This consisted of
generating 30 samples with six tags and ﬁve initialized phenotypes for
each sample type (see Supplementary Materials for details). The
DiSWOP values were calculated on a training set of ﬁve cancer and
ﬁve normal samples. The protein pair that gave the highest DiSWOP
value was selected as a biomarker. Then, each sample in the test set
was individually phenotyped and the DiSWOP values were calculated,
treating the sample as cancerous in order to obtain non-negative scores.
In the cancerous samples, the DiSWOP values for the selected protein
pair had a mean of 0.28 and a standard deviation of 0.06, whereas in the
normal samples, the values had a mean of 0.04 and a standard deviation
of 0.04. Therefore, in this set of synthetic data, the DiSWOP measure
provided an easy way to discriminate between the types of samples. In
addition, it was encouraging to see that the phenotyping results were
similar to the initialized phenotypes. Although most initialized pheno-
types were subdivided into two or three phenotypes, this was expected
with the synthetic data due to the large number of random pixel inten-
sities introduced when generating the expression of the tags. Only ~2%
of the cells were misclassiﬁed by the afﬁnity propagation clustering.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The results presented in Figure 3 suggest that it is, in fact, the
combinations of protein pairs with high dependency scores that
identify cancer cells, which is to be expected, considering the
complexity of the system. Calculating the DiSWOP and
DiSWAP measures identiﬁed pairs, which are signiﬁcantly more
co—dependent or anti-co-dependent in cancer samples than in
normal tissue. As can be seen in Figure 3a and c, EpCAM and
CEA have high positive DiSWOP score for both results. This may
be due to the fact that both proteins are involved in cell adhesion
[details of all the proteins considered have been previously pre-
sented (Bhattacharya et al., 2010)]. On the other hand, the pairs
CD36 and CD57, and CD44 and EpCAM were more likely to
interact in the normal tissue samples (Fig. 3a and c). These depen-
dencies can be seen in the data. Figure 5 shows the expression
levels of CEA, EpCAM and CD44 in a cancer and a normal
sample. It is clear that protein expression in Figure 5a and b
illustrate a higher dependence than in Figure 5d and e, whereas
the expression patterns in Figure 5b and c differ more than those
in Figure 5e and f. Similar trends can be seen in most of the other
samples. Considering the DiSWAP measure also highlights some
pairs of proteins such as CD44 and CD57 being more anti-co-
dependent in cancer samples and Ck19 and CD133 in normal
samples. It is important to note that these results were obtained
using only 11 samples, which, while being a great improvement on
previous studies in the toponomics of colon cancer (Bhattacharya
et al., 2010, Humayun et al., 2011), is still insufﬁcient to draw
signiﬁcant biological conclusions. To further analyze the consist-
ency of the two dependency measures, the analysis was performed
on 16 different combinations of three cancer and three normal
samples. The results are shown in Figure 6 where it can be seen
that the protein pairs with highest and lowest DiSWOP and
DiSWAP scores are the same as the ones found when all 11

samples were analyzed (Fig. 3). The protein interactions identiﬁed
should be validated biologically once the method has been applied
to a large number of samples. In fact, there are pathways invol-
ving some of the protein pairs highlighted, which have been found
to play an important role in colorectal cancer (Kovacheva et al.,
2014).

The use of synthetic data, where the ground truth of the inter-
action of the tags is known, gives support to the proposed
method. The DiSWOP and DiSWAP results for the data

generated using Equation (12) are shown in Figure 7. It can be
seen that the measures gave the expected results. DiSWOP gave
the largest positive value for tags 1 and 3 and the largest negative
value for tags 1 and 2. This corresponds to the rows with greatest
values in Equation (12). The smaller values of DiSWOP shown
in Figure 7 correspond to the second highest values in the matri-
ces in Equation (12). The results for DiSWAP are also as

The framework presented here is novel, as it clusters the cells
found in a sample, rather than the pixels, as in previous methods
(Humayun et al., 2011, Kolling et al., 2012; Langenkamper et al.,
2011). Hence, this method enables us to consider the heterogen-
eity of the samples. Using the MIC scores means that the PPDP
is considered rather than the raw expression proﬁle. Therefore,
the method is independent of the intensity of the images, and
hence different stacks can be considered simultaneously.
Furthermore, it enables the identiﬁcation of pairs of proteins
that are more active in cancer cells than in normal cells, and
Vice versa. The approach has been developed for images obtained
using TIS, but it can also be easily used for other multivariate
imaging techniques, such as MALDI imaging (Cornett et al.,
2007), Raman microscopy (Van Manen et al., 2005) and multi-
spectral imaging methods (Barash et al., 2010).

The proteins used were not chosen because links between them
were expected to show up in a protein network, but for a differ-
ent scientific purpose, namely, to help identify cell type. For this
reason, relatively few links were considered signiﬁcant, although
with a compensating chance that these links were previously un-
known. In the future, we will use additional proteins, and we
expect to ﬁnd additional links. Previous works on exploring
protein networks in colon cancer have used techniques like
microarrays, which, unfortunately, destroy all anatomical de-
tails. The advantage of our approach is that the links in
the protein network are found by studying individual cells.
However, a disadvantage is that we are restricted to at most
100 proteins, whereas microarrays measure expression of thou-
sands of genes simultaneously.

The proposed measures could prove more useful once a mem-
brane tag is used to help in a more accurate segmentation of cells.
Many of the proteins considered are located in parts of the cell
other than the nucleus, and these interactions are currently not
fully taken into account. Furthermore, a study with an extended
tag library may reveal more prominent dependencies specific to
cancerous tissue.

The binarization method (Schubert et al., 2006) introduced the
ideas of lead and absent proteins in motifs of protein clusters,
where a lead protein is one that is present after binarization in all
clusters and an absent protein is one that is not present in any of
the clusters. These ideas in a way have been expanded by the
DiSWOP and DiSWAP measures, which also identify colocation
and anti-co-location, respectively. The quantities introduced here
provide a measure of the degree, rather than a simple yesino

classiﬁcation, of the co-dependence of proteins. Furthermore,
they overcome the fact that these proteins are found in both
types of tissue by considering the difference between cancer
and normal samples.

4 CONCLUSIONS

We have introduced a novel method for analyzing multi-label
image data such as the TIS image data. It is different from pre-
viously presented methods in that it considers the samples at cell
rather than at pixel level, it is intensity independent and it allows
phenotyping of cells based on their protein co—expression proﬁle.
Owing to the general nature of the framework, the method could
be applied to other tissues and/or images obtained from other
multivariate imaging techniques. We have presented two new
measures of co-dependence and anti-co-dependence, namely,
DiSWOP and DiSWAP. Applying these over a TIS dataset of
11 samples of cancerous and normal colon tissue, we have found
combinations of protein pairs that are much more co—dependent
or anti-co-dependent in cancerous than in normal tissue, point-
ing to the possibility that combinations of protein pairs rather
than single proteins will lead to speciﬁc markers for cancer. The
results presented here are only preliminary and need to be vali-
dated using a larger number of samples and subsequently by
other biological techniques. Although the number of samples
considered is insufﬁcient to draw signiﬁcant biological conclu-
sions, this is the largest study of colon cancer using TIS con-
ducted to date. Furthermore, checks using synthetic data
give conﬁdence that our novel measures can help identify and
quantify important examples of co-dependence and anti-co-
dependence of protein pairs.

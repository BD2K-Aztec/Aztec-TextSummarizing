ABSTRACT

Motivation: Studying the evolutionary conservation of cancer genes
can improve our understanding of the genetic basis of human
cancers. Functionally related proteins encoded by genes tend to
interact with each other in a modular fashion, which may affect both
the mode and tempo of their evolution.

Results: In the human PPI network, we searched for subnetworks
within each of which all proteins have evolved at similar rates since
the human and mouse split. Identified at a given co-evolving level,
the subnetworks with non-randomly large sizes were defined as
co-evolving modules. We showed that proteins within modules tend
to be conserved, evolutionarily old and enriched with housekeeping
genes, while proteins outside modules tend to be less-conserved,
evolutionarily younger and enriched with genes expressed in specific
tissues. Viewing cancer genes from co-evolving modules showed
that the overall conservation of cancer genes should be mainly
attributed to the cancer proteins enriched in the conserved modules.
Functional analysis further suggested that cancer proteins within
and outside modules might play different roles in carcinogenesis,
providing a new hint for studying the mechanism of cancer.

1 INTRODUCTION

Studying the evolutionary conservation of disease/cancer genes can
improve our understanding of the genetic basis of human diseases.
However, current results on this topic are still inconsistent. Some
studies suggested that disease genes related to morbid phenotypes
evolve more slowly than other genes (Blekhman et (11., 2008; Furney
et (11., 2006; Kondrashov et (11., 2004; Thomas et (11., 2003; Tu et (11.,
2006). Other studies (Huang et (11., 2004; Smith and Eyre-Walker,
2003) indicated that disease genes may evolve faster than other genes
and thus are under weaker negative selection. Notably, most of these
studies treated disease/cancer genes and the rest genes as if they were
completely isolated and uncorrelated. However, it is known that
proteins encoded by genes tend to perform functions by interacting
with each other in a modular fashion (Barabasi and Oltvai, 2004),
which may affect both the mode and tempo of molecular evolution

by reducing pleiotropy and enabling protein modules to be co-opted
for new functions (Brown and Jurisica, 2007; Fraser, 2005, 2006;
Gerhart, 1997; Hakes et (11., 2007; Hartwell et (11., 1999; Schlosser,
2002; Waxman and Peck, 1998). Thus, studying the evolutionary
patterns of cancer genes in the context of protein (gene) modules
may provide us new clues to understand the genetic basis of human
cancer.

In this study, in the human PPI network, we ﬁrstly searched for
PPI subnetworks within each of which all proteins have evolved
at similar rates since the human and mouse split. At a given
co-evolving level, the identiﬁed PPI subnetworks with signiﬁcantly
large sizes were selected as co-evolving modules, which could be
highly cohesive fragments of some co-evolving functional units.
Comparing proteins within and outside modules, we found that
genes encoding proteins within modules tend to be conserved,
evolutionarily old and enriched with housekeeping genes (Dezso
et (11., 2008), while genes encoding proteins outside modules are
less-conserved, evolutionarily younger and enriched with genes
expressed in speciﬁc tissues.

Then, for proteins encoded by cancer genes collected in Cancer
Gene Census database (Futreal et (11., 2004), we showed that
the cancer proteins within modules tend to be evolutionarily
old and conserved, while the cancer proteins outside modules
tend to be evolutionarily younger and less conserved. Thus, the
overall conservation of cancer proteins in comparison with other
proteins (Furney et (11., 2006; Thomas et (11., 2003) should be
mainly attributed to the cancer proteins enriched in co-evolving
modules. These results suggested that cancer proteins with different
evolutionary patterns may play different ﬁlnctional roles in
carcinogenesis. In fact, we found that cancer proteins together with
their co-evolving neighbors within modules tend to participate in
some essential biological processes such as ‘nuclear mRNA splicing,
via spliceosome’ and ‘post-translational protein modiﬁcation’, while
cancer proteins outside modules tend to be enriched in ﬁlnctions
such as ‘DNA damage response’ and ‘DNA repair’.

2 METHODS

2.1 The evolutionary rate and evolutionary age data

The synonymous substitution rate (KS) and non-synomymous substitution
rate (Kn) data for human genes and their mouse (gallus) homologs
were downloaded from NCBI HomoloGene (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/
HomoloGene/buildSS) (Wheeler 61611., 2007). The Kt, and KS data for pairs of
homolog genes in a HomoloGene group are denoted by the symbols <HG-
Stats_ka> and <HG-Stats_ks> in the homologene.xml.gz ﬁle (a XML dump

of the HomoloGene build). To prevent possible contamination by paralogous
genes. we only considered one-to-one mapped orthologous pairs as Tu et a1.
(2006) did.

The orthologs of human genes in 39 fully sequenced eukaryotes were
obtained from the phylogenetic data by (Huerta-Cepas et (11.. 2007). Here.
we termed the proteins with fungi origin ‘old’. proteins with ortholgs in
metazoan (Anopheles gambiae. Drosophila melanogaster. Apis mellifera.
Caenorhabditis elegans and Caenorhabditis briggsae) ‘middle’. and proteins
speciﬁc to species emerged later than metazoan ‘young’.

2.2 The G0 annotation and PPI data

The G0 annotation data was downloaded on August 16. 2008. The human
PPI data was downloaded from MINT (Zanzoni et (11.. 2002). BIND (Bader
et (11.. 2001). IntAct (Hermjakob et (11.. 2004). HPRD (Peri et (11.. 2004).
MIPS (Mewes et (11.. 2008). DIP (Salwinski et (11.. 2004). KEGG (PPrel for
proteiniprotein interactions and ECrel for enzymes involved in neighboring
steps) (Kanehisa et (11.. 2006) and Reactome protein pairs involved in a
complex. reaction and neighboring reaction (Joshi-Tope et (11.. 2005). We
pooled together the eight PPI datasets as did in (Lage et (11.. 2007) and
compiled an integrated PPI network of 84 872 distinct interactions involving
10 863 connected human proteins with evolutionary rate data (Kn. Ka/KS).
Here. to reduce the false positive rate of the PPI data. we used the literature-
based PPI data from multiple sources. Though the literature-based human
PPI data might be biased to well-studied proteins (Oti et (11.. 2006). some
researchers argued that this bias is negligible (Rambaldi et (11.. 2008). We
note that even if this bias exists. our following results would be affected little
because we focused on comparing the cancer proteins within and outside
modules.

2.3 Cancer genes and housekeeping genes

From Cancer Gene Census database (Futreal et (11.. 2004). we extracted
313 cancer genes with both Kt, and PPI data. We also analyzed 340 candidate
cancer genes with both Kt, and PPI data. which were found in four somatic
mutation screens of cancer genomes (Greenman et (11.. 2007; Jones et (11..
2008; Parsons et (11.. 2008; Wood et (11.. 2007). Focusing on genes with both
Kt, and PPI data. 1856 housekeeping genes expressed in all of 31 human
tissues and 598 genes uniquely expressed in a single tissue were extracted
from (Dezso et (11.. 2008).

2.4 Measures of the difference of proteins in
evolutionary rates

The evolutionary rate of a protein is often measured by Kt, deﬁned as the
number of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site of the
protein since the split of two species. It is also often measured by Ka/KS
where K. is the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site.
which calculates the accepted non-synonymous substitutions normalized by
chance if selection does not act on silent sites (Hurst. 2002; Wall 21 (11..
2005). However. K. is also subject to selection in many species (Akashi.
2001). Thus. we used both Kt, and Ka/KS to measure the evolutionary rates
of human proteins. Here. we only showed the results based on K”. The results
based on Ka/KS were consistent.

The absolute difference of two proteins 1 and j in evolutionary rate since
the humanimouse split was calculated as AK,” 2 |Kai—Kaj|. If they have
evolved at similar rates over this time range. then AKaij should be small
(Marino-Ramirez et (11.. 2006). As a distance metrics. AKaij has three main
properties: (i) symmetry. AKaijzAKHJ-i; (ii) non-negative. AKaiJ-ZO; and
(iii) delta non-negative. AK,” 5 (AKaik + AKajk).

2.5 Finding co-evolving functional modules

In the human PPI network. we searched for locally maximal PPI subnetworks
within each of which all proteins have evolved at similar rates since the
human and mouse split. In each subnetwork. the absolute difference of

the evolutionary rates for every two proteins was required within a given
threshold. reﬂecting the co-evolving level of these proteins in the subnetwork.
Here. the threshold was taken as the top 5. 2.5 or 1 percentile of the
distribution of AKaij for all-against-all proteins pairs.

Using the method proposed in Chuang et a1. (2007). we performed a
greedy search in the human PPI network to ﬁnd co-evolving PPI subnetworks
with locally maximal sizes. First. we took each protein as a seed. Then. from
its interacting neighbors. we selected one protein whose evolutionary rate is
similar to that of the seed. Iteratively. from proteins interacting with at least
one of the pro-selected proteins. we selected one protein whose evolutionary
rate was similar to all members of the pro-selected proteins. At each iteration
step. when there were several proteins evolved at similar rates with all the
pro-selected proteins. we randomly chose one. Such a random choice may
lead to slightly different subnetworks (see details in Supplementary Data).
The search stops when no proteins can be added.

The subnetworks selected above were considered as candidate
subnetworks. from which we further selected signiﬁcant subnetworks with
non-randomly large sizes according to two random experiments (Chuang
et (11.. 2007). First. we produced 100 random networks by permuting the
evolutionary rates of the proteins in the original PPI network and performed
the same search procedure in each random network. The signiﬁcance of
the size of a candidate subnetwork was calculated as the percentage of
the subnetworks. extracted from the 100 random networks. whose sizes
were larger than the candidate subnetwork. Then. in each of the 100
random networks. we extracted subnetworks initialized from the same
seed protein for producing the candidate subnetwork and estimated the
percentage of the extracted subnetworks which were larger than the candidate
subnetwork. Finally. from the candidate subnetworks. we selected the
ones with signiﬁcantly larger sizes according to both tests (P5005) as
co-evolving modules or modules for short.

The non-randomly large sizes of the modules suggested that the emergence
of the modules could be introduced by the underlying evolutionary constraint
on interacting proteins. Notably. when allowing a larger threshold for the
absolute difference between the evolutionary rates of every two proteins in a
subnetwork. we could identify larger subnetworks. The smaller the threshold
is controlled. the more cohesive are the identiﬁed modules in co-evolution.
Identiﬁed at a co-evolving level. the modules could be considered as highly
cohesive fragments of some co-evolving functional units. At a given co-
evolving level. we deﬁned all proteins in the identiﬁed modules as proteins
within modules and compared them with proteins outside modules.

Identiﬁed by the greedy search algorithm. some modules might share
proteins and their boundaries could not be clearly deﬁned. This is a common
problem for algorithms for ﬁnding PPI subnetworks based on optimizing
some given scores (Chuang et (11.. 2007; Kelley and Ideker. 2005; Ulitsky
and Shamir. 2007). Here. we did not try to delete or merge modules with
overlapping proteins according to some empirical criterion as did in some
researches (Kelley and Ideker. 2005; Ulitsky and Shamir. 2007). Instead.
we simply treated all modules as cohesive fragments of some co-evolving
functional units.

2.6 Difference between proteins within and outside
modules in the evolutionary rate

To evaluate the signiﬁcance of the difference between the median Kt, of
the proteins within and outside modules. we calculated the corresponding
difference in each of 100 random networks produced by randomly permuting
the Kt, values of the proteins in the original PPI network. Then. the
signiﬁcance (P-value) of the real difference was calculated as the percentage
of the random differences which were larger than the real difference. When
evaluating the signiﬁcance of the difference between the median Kt, of
the cancer proteins within and outside modules. we produced 100 random
networks by separately permuting Kt, for cancer proteins and other proteins
in the original PPI network. By such a way. the Kt, distribution of cancer
proteins in each random network was the same as that in the original PPI
network.

Viewing cancer genes from co-evolving gene modules

 

We note that when applying the ManniWhitney U-test to examine the
difference of proteins within and outside modules in K”, the same signiﬁcant
results were found. However, the ManniWhitney U-test might be biased
to some extend since the evolutionary rates of interacting proteins are
correlated.

2.7 Functional enrichment analysis

We identiﬁed biological process categories of GO enriched with proteins
within (or outside) modules by Elim algorithm (Alexa et (11., 2006) which
can remove some generic categories whose enrichment could be explained by
their signiﬁcant descendant categories. In a category of G0, the probability
(P) of observing at least a given number of proteins within (or outside)
modules by random chance was calculated by the hypergeometric test. The
P—Values were adjusted by the Bonferroni correction.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Co-evolving modules and proteins’ conservation

We set the threshold for controlling the absolute difference of the
evolutionary rates for each protein pair in a subnetwork as the top 5,
2.5 or 1 percentile cutoff of the distribution of AKm-j for all-against-
all proteins pairs. When setting the threshold as the top 5 percentile
cutoff, we found 382 co-evolving modules with sizes signiﬁcantly
larger than expected by random chance (P f 0.05) by the algorithm
described in ‘Methods’ section. When setting the threshold as the
top 2.5 or 1 percentile cutoff, though the identiﬁed modules became
smaller, all our following conclusions were consistently obtained
(Supplementary Data and Supplementary Figs S1 and S2).

As shown in Figure 1A, most proteins within modules are
conserved with Kn1 ranging from 0 to 0.0261 (median 0.0103),
while most proteins outside modules are not conserved with Kg
ranging from 0 to 0.7038 (median 0.0644). However, due to
some statistical and biological factors (see more in ‘Discussion’
section), a small fraction of the proteins outside modules are also
conserved. The difference between the median Kn1 of proteins
within and outside modules was not observed in 100 random
networks with permuted Kg (P<0.01). Furthermore, according
to the human phylome (Huerta-Cepas et (11., 2007), 81.13% of
the genes encoding proteins within modules have fungi origin
(termed old, see ‘Methods’ section) or orthologs in metazoan
(termed middle, see ‘Methods’ section) (Fig. 1B). Thus, the proteins
within modules tend to be involved in essential functions for
both single- and multi-cellular organisms. In comparison, only
55.93% of the proteins outside modules are of old or middle age
(P<2.20e— 16, Fisher’s exact test). Additionally, based on the
gene expression proﬁles in 31 human tissues (Dezso et (11., 2008),
we found that genes encoding proteins within modules are enriched
with housekeeping genes (P: 1.59e— 11, hypergeometric test),
while genes encoding proteins outside modules are enriched with
genes expressed in speciﬁc tissues (P=2.27e—06, hypergeometric
test). All together, these results supported the assumption that
evolutionary innovations tend to occur by altering proteins outside
modules (Fraser, 2005; Hartwell et (11., 1999).

Similar results were observed when focusing cancer proteins
within and outside modules. The median Kg (0.01) of the cancer
proteins within modules is smaller than the median Kn1 (0.0528) of
the cancer proteins outside modules (Fig. 2A). By the randomized
experiment as described in ‘Methods’ section, we found that the
difference between the median Kn1 of cancer proteins within and

outside modules could not be observed in any of the 100 random
networks (P < 0.01). This result suggested that the previously
reported overall conservation of cancer proteins in comparison with
other proteins (Furney et (11., 2006; Thomas et (11., 2003) should be
mainly attributed to the enrichment of cancer proteins in co-evolving
modules (P =2.60e—08, hypergeometric test). Additionally,
62.82% of the cancer proteins within modules are of old or middle
age, while less (50.28%) cancer proteins outside modules are of old
or middle age (P=0.0631, Fisher’s exact test) (Fig. 2B).

3.2 Functional roles of different cancer proteins

Different conservation patterns of cancer proteins within and outside
modules suggest that they may play distinct ﬁinctional roles in
carcinogenesis. By the hypergeometric test with 5% FDR control,
we found that 139 of the 382 co-evolving module are enriched with
cancer proteins. Additionally, we found that proteins encoded by
the candidate cancer genes found from somatic mutation screens of
cancer genomes (Greenman et (11., 2007; Jones et (11., 2008; Parsons
et (11., 2008; Wood et (11., 2007) are also signiﬁcantly enriched in
these 139 co-evolving modules (P=0.0301, hypergeometric test),
suggesting that disruptions of these co-evolving modules might play
essential roles in carcinogenesis.

module.

Then, we performed ﬁinctional enrichment analysis for each of
the 139 modules, by the method described in ‘Methods’ section.
The results showed that genes within these co—evolving modules are
enriched in essential biological processes ‘nuclear mRNA splicing,
via spliceosome’, ‘transmembrane receptor protein serine/threonine
kinase signaling pathway’, ‘RNA elongation’, ‘post—translational
protein modiﬁcation’, ‘regulation of RNA metabolic process’ and
‘BMP signaling pathway’ (Fig. 3) (Supplementary Table $1). The
cancer proteins outside modules are enriched in GO biological
processes ‘DNA damage response’, ‘signal transduction by
p53 class mediator resulting in induction of apoptosis‘, ‘DNA
repair‘, ‘mismatch repair’, ‘regulation of transcription, DNA-
dependent’, ‘transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter’
and ‘peptidyl—tyrosine phosphorylation’. The results suggested that
cancer proteins within modules tend to participate in essential
biological processes and be conserved, while cancer proteins
outside modules tend to participate in ﬁinctions for keeping the
stability of the genome and have a higher degree of evolutionary
plasticity.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

Based on the assumption that genes/proteins tend to express and
perform functions in a modular fashion, some methods (e.g. EM
algorithm, simulated annealing and greedy search) have been
proposed for ﬁnding different types of gene/protein modules such
as modules of co—regulated genes (Segal et (11., 2003) and PPI
subnetworks related to a speciﬁc condition(s) (Chuang et (11., 2007;
Guo et (11., 2007; Ideker et (11., 2002; Kelley and Ideker, 2005;
Ulitsky and Shamir, 2007). Here, similarly to algorithms searching
for PPI subnetworks related to a speciﬁc condition (Chuang et (11.,
2007), we performed a greedy search in the human PPI network
to identify co-evolving PPI subnetworks at a given co-evolving
level. The identiﬁed PPI subnetworks could be highly cohesive
parts or fragments of some co—evolving functional units. Our
results suggested that proteins within and outside modules have
different evolutionary patterns and supported the assumption that
evolutionary innovations tend to occur by altering proteins outside
modules (Fraser, 2005; Hartwell et (11., 1999). Viewing cancer genes

Viewing cancer genes from co-evolving gene modules

 

from co-evolving modules suggested that the overall conservation
of cancer genes (Furney et (11., 2006; Thomas et (11., 2003) should
be mainly attributed to the enrichment of cancer proteins in the
conserved modules. In addition, we found that different from cancer
genes within modules participating in some essential biological
processes, cancer genes outside modules tend to play speciﬁc roles
in ﬁinctions related to DNA damage response and DNA repair. All
together, these results suggested that the dysregulation of cancer
proteins with different evolutionary and ﬁinctional patterns might
play different roles in carcinogenisis.

Genes might have differentiated ﬁinctionalities in different
species, leading to changed co-evolving modules during different
evolutionary periods. Here, we analyzed a case about the ﬁinctional
overlapping between modules co-evolving since the human—mouse
split and modules co-evolving since the human—gallus split which
took place much earlier than the time of the human—mouse split.
Generally, the modules of genes co-evolving since the human—gallus
split are smaller than the modules of genes co-evolving since the
human—mouse split. The largest module for human—gallus contains
134 genes enriched in ‘nuclear mRNA splicing, via spliceosome’
and ‘translational elongation’ (by the Elim algorithm, Bonferroni
correction P<0.05). As shown in Supplementary Table S2, this
module shares 68 genes with the largest module for human—mouse
which contains 396 genes enriched in the above two ﬁinctions as
well as in another four functions. However, some other genes in
the largest module for human-gallus are not included in the largest
modules for human—mouse. These results indicated that some genes
cohesively co-evolving during the time since both the human—
mouse split and the human—gallus split might perform some basic
ﬁinctions and thus be subjected to higher evolutionary constraints,
while some other genes might have differentiated ﬁinctionalities
and thus different co-evolving patterns since the human—mouse
split. However, this result should be interpreted with great caution
because the partial overlapping between co-evolving modules might
be artiﬁcially introduced by the algorithm limitation that a co-
evolving functional unit could be detected as several fragmental
modules.

As shown in the ‘Results’ section, some proteins outside modules
are conserved though most are not. The conservation of some
proteins outside modules could be explained by some statistical
and biological factors. First, with a threshold for controlling the
absolute difference between the evolutionary rates of protein pairs
in the PPI subnetworks, the modules identiﬁed at a co-evolving
level may miss some proteins (or some parts) of co-evolving
ﬁinctional units. Second, because current PPI data may cover
only a small fraction of all the human protein—protein interactions
(Hart et (11., 2006), some proteins co-evolving with proteins in
modules might be missed though we pooled eight literature-based
PPI datasets together (Lage et (11., 2007). Also, the incomplete PPI
data may lead to the presence of many small modules whose sizes
were not signiﬁcantly larger than expected by random chance but
they could be biologically meaninng. This problem needs to be
ﬁirther addressed by integrating high-throughput PPI data and by
assessing the signiﬁcance of the modules on other aspects. Third,
one hypothesis about how a PPI network and its constituent modules
evolve indicates that proteins interacting with multiple modules
might evolve more slowly owing to the high pleiotropic constraints
on them (Fisher, 1930; Greenberg et (11., 2008; Hahn and Kern,
2005; Waxman and Peck, 1998). According to this hypothesis, some

conserved proteins outside modules might regulate or participate in
multiple functions and be subjected to high evolutionary constraints.
In our previous work (Ma et (11., 2009), we found that the disruption
of genes densely interacting with multiple ﬁinctions associated with
cancers may play pivot roles in carcinogenesis. In general, because
genes play biological functions in a coordinated fashion in biological
systems, studying the coordinated operations of genes within and
outside modules can help us understand how these genes (and
modules) play functional roles in inducing diseases. In our ﬁiture
work, we will ﬁirther elucidate the coordinated roles of cancer
proteins within and outside modules in inducing cancer by exploiting
molecular data such as somatic mutations and epigenetic changes in
cancer genomes (Chan et (11., 2008; Schuebel et (11., 2007).

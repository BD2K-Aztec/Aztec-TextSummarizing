Abstract

Motivation: In attempts to determine the genetic causes of human disease, researchers are often
faced with a large number of candidate genes. Linkage studies can point to a genomic region con—
taining hundreds of genes, while the high—throughput sequencing approach will often identify a
great number of non—synonymous genetic variants. Since systematic experimental verification of
each such candidate gene is not feasible, a method is needed to decide which genes are worth
investigating further. Computational gene prioritization presents itself as a solution to this problem,
systematically analyzing and sorting each gene from the most to least likely to be the disease—
causing gene, in a fraction of the time it would take a researcherto perform such queries manually.
Results: Here, we present Gene Tlssue Expression Ranker (GeneTlER), a new web—based applica—
tion for candidate gene prioritization. GeneTlER replaces knowledge—based inference traditionally
used in candidate disease gene prioritization applications with experimental data from tissue—
specific gene expression datasets and thus largely overcomes the bias toward the better character—
ized genes/diseases that commonly afflict other methods. We show that our approach is capable of
accurate candidate gene prioritization and illustrate its strengths and weaknesses using case study
examples.

1 Introduction

 

Current high—throughput sequencing methods used for disease gene
discovery can generate very large volumes of data. While the extrac—
tion of non—synonymous, potentially deleterious variants can be eas—
ily automated, this often results in the identification of thousands of
candidate disease genes. Since the experimental verification of an in—
dividual gene can be both difficult and time consuming, some
method to prioritize the order in which such verification is sought is

often employed. A common approach is to examine biological data—
bases and literature for information pertaining to each candidate
disease gene, in order to select the most promising genes. This can
be both slow and error—prone, as the data are spread across multiple
resources with no common structure. Nor can this type of analysis
be quantified, since the selection is based solely on the subjective im—
pressions of the researcher.

In light of these challenges, various computational gene priori—
tization methods have been proposed. These vary substantially in
terms of both intended usage and underlying algorithms (reviewed
in Tranchevent et (11., 2011). Generalized methods rely extensively
on data mining of sequence information, gene expression datasets,
functional annotations and/or protein—protein interactions. These
data are most frequently employed in a ‘guilt—by—association’ frame—
work, in which candidate disease genes are ranked based on the
strength of relationships and/or similarities to genes already known
to be linked with the disease. One of the major drawbacks of such
approaches is the bias introduced toward better characterized genes
and/or diseases. Thus, in particular where little prior knowledge
about the disease and/or gene is available, accurate prioritization of
putative disease genes remains a challenge.

The availability and wide coverage of experimental conditions of
gene expression datasets might alleviate issues arising from incom—
plete data, as current technologies allow for the quantification of an
entire transcriptome. Indeed, gene expression data are a crucial
constituent of several web—based gene prioritization applications;
however, it tends to be used in concert with other data types, such
as pathway/interaction networks or functional annotations.
Established web tools such as ToppGene (Chen et (11., 2009),
Endeavour (Tranchevent et (11., 2008) and CANDID (Hutz et (11.,
2008) employ a modular approach to prioritization, scoring candi—
dates based on a consensus from multiple data sources. Even though
it has been demonstrated that consensus methods are more accurate
than approaches utilizing fewer data categories (Bornigen et (11.,
2012), the former have been criticized for both the ‘guilt—by—associ—
ation’ bias and failure to exploit the best performing methods for
each component (Chen et (11., 2011).

More specialized algorithms often integrate gene expression data
into a heterogeneous (Chen et (11., 2011, Ma et (11., 2007, Nitsch
et (11., 2011) or homogenous (van Dam et (11., 2012) network, where
distance between genes can be derived from and/or weighted by dif—
ferential expression or co—expression values. Alternatively, some
methods (Chen et (11., 2009, Masotti et (11., 2008, Seelow et (11.,
2008) consider gene co—expression in a non—network context, utiliz—
ing common statistical vector correlation measures to rank candi—
date disease genes based on how well their expression patterns
correlate with those of genes known to be directly or indirectly
linked to the disease.

Fewer applications attempt to apply tissue—specific expression
patterns for gene prioritization tasks. Endeavour (Tranchevent
et (11., 2008) incorporates gene expression data from 79 normal
human tissues found in Gene Expression Atlas, comparing gene ex—
pression between candidate and user—supplied seed genes across tis—
sues. A recent update to PhenoDigm (Oellrich and Smedley, 2014
Smedley et (11., 2013) has incorporated tissue—specific, binary mouse
gene expression data from 21 mouse tissues and derived phenotype—
tissue associations in order to supplement its phenotype—based
queries.

Nonetheless, none of these approaches distance themselves en—
tirely from the ‘guilt—by—association’ approach. Here, we investigate
the use of publicly available gene expression data as the sole means
of prioritizing candidate disease genes. The resulting web applica—
tion GeneTIER scores candidate disease genes based on the hypoth—
esis that genes responsible for a tissue(s)—specific phenotype are
expected to be more highly expressed in affected than unaffected tis—
sues. GeneTIER depends on an extensive database that has been
built using publicly available microarray and RNA sequencing data—
sets and is composed of several million expression values for numer—
ous normal tissues. This enables the creation of a global, cross—tissue

expression profile for each candidate disease gene, permitting
expression profile—based prioritization without reliance on or re—
quirement for other prior knowledge about the disease or candidate
genes. GeneTIER should thus be suitable for prioritization of candi—
dates for poorly characterized diseases.

2 Methods
2.1 Database

The Gene expression database contains 9 972 862 baseline gene ex—
pression values from microarray and RNA—Seq experiments, encom—
passing 140 different control, non—diseased mouse and human tissue
types. The database was assembled from public domain sources,
including datasets from Gene Expression Atlas (Petryszak et (11.,
2014), RNA—Seq Expression Atlas (Krupp et (11., 2012),
ArrayExpress (Rocca—Serra et (11., 2003) and Gene Expression
Omnibus (Barrett et (11., 2009).

Microarray probe set to Ensembl gene transcript identifier map—
pings were downloaded from the Biomart resource (Kasprzyk,
2011). As per recommended practice, ambiguous data arising from
microarray probes which hybridize to more than one distinct gene
were discarded (Ramasamy et (11., 2008). Similarly, HGNC, Ensembl
and Entrez and RefSeq gene identifiers were obtained from Biomart.
UCSC gene names and exon boundary coordinates were down—
loaded using the UCSC Genome Browser’s ‘Table’ page (Karolchik
et (11., 2004) using the hg19 human genome assembly.
Mouse—human gene orthologs were downloaded from MGI (Bult
et (11., 2008) and mapped using HomoloGene (Flicek et (11., 2014).

2.2 The gene prioritization algorithm

Candidate genes are ranked based on several factors derived from
gene expression data. These comprise the levels of expression in the
affected tissues; variance in expression across all tissues; and expres—
sion level differences between affected and unaffected tissues. The
base score, (Sg), for each candidate disease gene is calculated using
Equation (1):

it if 2,20

S 2; zt-(1+1n§) (1)

Z

where t is an affected tissue in a set of all affected tissues T; E, is the
mean of modified z—scores (see below) for tissue t; and E is the me—
dian modified z—score across all tissues. If gene expression in an af—
fected tissue is greater than its baseline expression the natural
logarithm ratio is positive; otherwise the value is negative. The value
of (Sg) is a fractional modifier, favoring genes which show elevated
gene expression in disease—associated tissues, compared with tissues
not linked to the disease phenotype, even if the expression value is
relatively low. The score can be further adjusted for highly expressed
genes which takes into account the level of variance in expression
across all tissues in order to reduce the contention of highly ubiqui—
tously expressed housekeeping genes. When included in the analysis,
the results from human RNA sequencing, human microarray, mouse
RNA sequencing and mouse microarray data are each considered
separately, and combined to generate the final ranking score. In
cases where incomplete data may arise—for example, genes which
are not probed on the microarray or are ambiguous, the instance
may still be scored using only one evidence type.When the final
ranking score is derived from human and mouse data, the relative
contribution of mouse tissue datasets relative to the human datasets
can be adjusted by the user.

Modified z—scores for all RNA sequencing and microarray data—
sets were calculated as shown in Equation (2):

0.6745 - (e — E)

N 7 (2)
median(le — 

zeEE :

where E denotes a set of normalized expression values in an experi—
ment, with individual elements e; E is thus the mean value of E and
the denominator is the median absolute deviation, where e is an in—
dividual element of E and E is the median of all elements in E.

The modified z—scores enable the transformation of non—
normally distributed gene expression data and measure how each
data point differs from the typical observations within the dataset.
This transformation serves both to aid the prioritization and to fa—
cilitate better comparability between microarray datasets, as it has
been suggested that rank—based transformations of microarray data
alleviate some of the issues associated with comparing cross—plat—
form, cross—laboratory data (Irizarry et al., 2005).

2.3 Benchmarking dataset

The performance of the application was evaluated using a set of
1000 gene—disease associations, which was generated using the ‘The
Human Phenotype Ontology’ (HPO) (Kohler et al., 2014) dataset as
a source for disease genes and associated phenotypes. The HPO is a
curated ontology, organizing human disease phenotypes described
in the Online Inheritance In Man (OMIM) database (URL: http://
omim.orgl), as well as Orphanet (URL: http://www.orpha.net) and
medical literature in a structured, controlled vocabulary. This
enabled the generation of a large dataset while bypassing any inac—
curacies that can arise from the lack of precision when text—mining
unstructured entries in OMIM (which sometimes describe legacy or
historical information).

A sub—group of all HPO phenotypes was selected based on the
following criteria: high term specificity (defined as the distance of a
term from the root of the ontology); terms which could be unam—
biguously mapped to tissues through axiomatic links to an anatom—
ical ontology (Golbreich et al., 2006, Kohler et al., 2013,
(Hoehndorfet al., 2010) or manual assignment. A total of 2922 dis—
tinct disease genes were found to be annotated as associated with
HPO diseases and were subsequently matched with selected pheno—
types. Phenotypes, where a frequency modifier for a disease is
denoted as ‘very rare’ or in the cases where the frequency modifier is
given as a percentage, <2% of all cases reported, were not con—
sidered. Finally, from the resulting data, 1000 disease—genes associ—
ations were selected at random for testing (Supplementary Data 1).

In order to ascertain how tissue selection affects prioritization
with GeneTiER, diseases with a distinct, localized phenotype were
categorized using Disease Ontology, using definitions which are des—
cendants of the term ‘disease of anatomical entity’ (DOID:7). 500
disease—gene associations were selected for testing (Supplementary
Data 2).

2.4 Implementation

The implementation is accessible through a web—based interface
(Fig. 1), which was constructed to HTML5 specification, utilizing
JavaScript throughout; JavaScript browser support is thus required.
Currently, the user may supply candidate disease genes in the follow—
ing formats: a single or multiple genomic region(s), specified by
chromosome and interval boundaries; a pre—filtered VCF file contain—
ing potentially deleterious variants (enforced by file size limit); a can—
didate gene list in a delimited format, accepting several commonly

used delimiter types. The gene list can be composed of Ensembl
(Flicek et al., 2014), Entrez (Maglott et al., 2011) or Refseq (Pruitt
et al., 2014) accession numbers, HGNC—approved gene names
(Gray et al., 2013); common aliases or any combination of thereof
may be used as input. GeneTIER performs automatic conversions be—
tween human genes and their mouse orthologs, as well as optionally
resolving ambiguous input gene aliases and identifiers based on mul—
tiple criteria. Up to 100 top results can be viewed directly in the
browser and the entire analysis can be downloaded as a text file.
GeneTIER is freely available at http://dna.leeds.ac.uk/GeneTIER/.

3 Results

The algorithm used by GeneTIER assumes that a disease gene’s expres—
sion tends to be significantly higher in affected tissues compared with
unaffected tissue. To test the generality of this assumption, we retrieved
expression values from our database for all genes in our training set
(see Section 2) and performed a two—sample Kolmogorov—Smirnov test
for non—normally distributed data, using an alternative hypothesis that
the cumulative frequency distribution function of modified scores from
unaffected tissues lies below that of modified scores from disease—
associated tissues. For RNA—sequencing data this resulted in statistic
D : 0.1517, with respective P—value < 2.2e’16 and for microarray data
D : 0.1334, P—value < 2.2616.

The performance of GeneTIER was assessed on a dataset com—
prised of 1000 known associations between disease genes and tissues
expected to be affected by each gene’s dysfunction. For each disease
gene, four sets of random genes were generated, comprising 50, 100,
200 and 500 genes. The disease genes were prioritized against the
genes in the randomly generated gene sets and the results analyzed
using ROC analysis. ROC curves provide a way to visualize and
compare classifier performance. Here, the candidate gene prioritiza—
tion algorithm can be viewed as a non—binary scoring classifier,
where disease—linked genes are positive instances and other candi—
dates are negatives. The values—or ranks—from the classifier out—
put can be converted into binary positive and negative scores using
cut—off thresholds. Thus, a confusion matrix can be calculated for
every integer rank cut—off value from which comparison metrics,
such as sensitivity and specificity values are derived. ROC graphs
allow the visualization of sensitivity versus 1—specificity. The line
running from the origin (0,0) to the maximum point of 1,1 (Y:X),
which corresponds to an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.5, repre—
sents a performance that is no better than random predictions.
Points on a ROC curve that occur above this line represent an algo—
rithm with better than random classifier performance, while those
below the line have worse than random results, i.e. a bias toward
classifying positives as negatives. An algorithm with an AUC of 1
represents perfect classifier performance.

Figure 2 shows the resultant ROC graphs while Table 1 shows
the corresponding AUC scores. This analysis suggests that the algo—
rithm’s performance was inversely related to the number of non—
disease genes in the analysis, but does not decline in a linear manner.
In fact, the differences in performance when assessed on candidate
lists consisting of 100, 200 or 500 candidates are minor and do not
suggest that the maximum candidate gene list size will be encoun—
tered in typical gene mapping experiments. Overall, the obtained
AUC values are sufficiently high to suggest that disease genes are
typically ranked higher than the randomly selected genes in each
data set by this algorithm.

In order to illustrate the circumstances where our methodology
either failed or succeeded, we used a case study of the global

(OMIM:610282), a degenerative eye disease causing severe vision
impairment. Figure 3 shows the expression profiles across multiple
normal tissues of five disease genes known to underlie retinitis pig—
mentosa, while Tables 2 and 3 show the summary of the mean ranks
obtained using our method. The genes PRPF3 and PRPF31 show dis—
tinct, tissue—specific expression in eye tissues with negligible expres—
sion in non—ocular tissue; disease genes with similar expression
profiles are ranked very highly by our methodology. While PRPF6 is
also highly expressed in eye tissues, unlike PRPF3 and PRPF31 its
expression is not limited to ocular tissues, resulting in a reduced, but
still strongly suggestive ranking. ROM1 is expressed in a number of
non—ocular tissues as well as in corneal epithelial cells but still
ranked highly. This was in spite of its lower expression in corneal
epithelial cells than that of the PRPF genes and comparable expres—
sion in adipose tissue. Unsurprisingly, in view of its ubiquitously
low expression levels, the methodology failed to identify PR1.

In order to ascertain whether our method is more appropriate
for certain disease types, we analyzed how well GeneTiER performs
across a range of tissues. Supplementary Figure S1 highlights that
GeneTiER can accurately prioritize genes across most tissue catego—
ries, recognizing endocrine and integumentary system—specific genes

The eye is a complex organ with many specialized tissue types.
While the GeneTiER database contains expression data from cor—
neal epithelial cells, stromal cells and murine lens, these do not en—
compass all the diverse cell types present in the eye. Consequently,
diseases of the eye that do not affect these tissues will not be cor—
rectly prioritized by our approach. Conversely, diseases affecting vi—
sion can be neurodegenerative in nature, in which case the causative

gene may not have a function in the eye.Finally, we have considered
which data type—RNA—Seq or microarray—enabled more accurate
prioritization results. We considered all diseases where both RNA—
Seq and microarray data were available for all the identified affected
tissue types. Supplementary Figure S2 shows the ROC curves ob—
tained when the dataset was prioritized together with 100 random
genes. The difference in performance between RNA—Seq and micro—
array data is minimal, with RNA—sequencing data giving better re—
sults (ROC 0.80 versus 0.78), but slightly worse than the combined
score approach (ROC 0.81).This is in concordance with a recent
study by Wang et al. (2014), who found that while more differen—
tially expressed genes identified by RNA—sequencing than micro—
array studies could be verified by qPCR, the gain was mostly from
the improved quantification of low abundance transcripts.

Furthermore, while sequencing data do provide a small improve—
ment over microarray data in prioritization, this is offset by a more
limited public availability of sequencing datasets. There are cur—
rently 41124 microarray datasets deposited in Array Express data—
base in contrast to only 5745 RNA—sequencing experiments
(accessed 01/03/2014).

4 Discussion

While a number of methods have been previously employed for the
prioritization of candidate disease genes, none are universally ap—
plicable. These methods tend to rely heavily on prior knowledge
about the disease, phenotype and/or genes, making them unsuitable
systems for classifying novel and/or poorly characterized genes. The
best performing methods have been shown to rely on a variety of in—
formation sources to compensate for inadequacies in knowledge in
any single domain. However, there is value to be found in
approaches which distance themselves entirely from the ‘guilt—by—
association’ principle used by these methods, which have an inherent
bias toward well characterized genes.

The wide range of open access gene expression data can serve to
overcome the limitations of prior knowledge—based approaches by

substituting gene— or disease—specific information with tissue—specific
experimental data. However, implementations of this approach
often exhibit certain limitations. Some implementations prioritize
candidate disease genes based on co—expression with genes already
known to be associated with the disease in question. This requires
the user to supply ‘seed’ genes, thus making the assumption that pre—
existing knowledge about the disease is either available or relevant
to the particular disease phenotype. This may not be the case; for ex—
ample, OMIM currently contains several thousand disease entries
for which no contributing genes are yet known.

Conversely, a number of network—based methods prioritize genes
under the assumption that a disease gene will exist in a local net—
work of genes which are highly differentially expressed between af—
fected and unaffected tissues. However, while this type of approach
can be successful in disease—specific studies, it is difficult to general—
ize for wider use, due to its reliance on differential expression data—
sets between disease and control tissue samples. Some
implementations overcome these difficulties by requesting the user
to supply their own data. However, this can be seen as a contradic—
tion to the major aim of computational candidate prioritization
which is to reduce the experimental burden on a researcher, rather
than requiring the user to perform further studies. In this study, we
present a novel application for candidate disease gene prioritization
that aims to address the shortcomings discussed above. GeneTiER
does not require the user to have any prior knowledge of the disease,
other than the ability to unambiguously identify affected tissues.
The application has been specifically designed to require only min—
imal user input, and takes care of conversions between a variety of
commonly used gene identifiers and between human/mouse
orthologs.

We have taken advantage of both microarray expression and
RNA sequencing data available in the public domain to create an ex—
tensive tissue—specific expression database that can support a wide
variety of gene prioritization queries. Organs are made up of many
functionally diverse tissue cell types and this can be reﬂected in the
experimental data. Therefore, we have striven to collate data from
multiple, distinctive datasets, to enable the user to make tissue cell
type—specific queries which are not supported by many of the popu—
lar databases.

Many popular gene prioritization methods that rely on prior
knowledge about a disease use either text—mining approaches or
Gene Ontology annotations to score candidates based on relevance
to query. Currently, there are still over a thousand human genes
with no available GO annotations and many more with ‘shallow’
annotations. While this presents a problem for disease gene infer—
ence by similarity, the method described here would not be any less
applicable. For example, at the time of writing, no Gene Ontology
annotations have yet been ascribed to the human CDRI gene,
known to contribute to paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration

(OMIM:302650). This gene shows localized expression in brain tis—
sues, in particular in the cerebellum, and as such is scored highly by
our method, whereas approaches reliant on prior knowledge are
likely to fail. However, direct performance comparisons between
gene prioritization tools are difficult—without cross—validation, any
prioritization on known disease genes is meaningless, and to the best
of our knowledge, no web gene prioritization application provides a
performance assessment mode.

While we have shown that GeneTiER is capable of accurate dis—
ease gene prioritization through ROC analysis (with AUC values of
up to 0.83), it should be noted that the disease gene is rarely ranked
first in the output. This ranking should therefore be used as a guide to
the order in which candidate genes should be analyzed further. Even
so, it must be noted that not all disease gene expression patterns con—
form to the assumptions underlying our model. For example, some
disease genes show universally high or low gene expression across all
tissues (see RP1 in Fig. 3). Indeed, aberrant activation of genes which
are normally repressed can result in a disease phenotype, as is the case
in many cancers. However, in order to detect these patterns, the differ—
ential expression change must be observed between the normal and af—
fected states. While including differential expression data from
normal and affected patients would no doubt improve GeneTiER per—
formance, public availability of such data is mostly limited to a small
number of well—studied diseases and therefore would enhance the re—
sults for only a small proportion of cases.

Furthermore, as Oellrich and Smedley (2014) note in their ana—
lysis, the site of gene expression and the visible phenotype do not al—
ways coincide. Consequently, the limitations of this method must be
understood and taken into consideration when examining the final
gene rankings. This is especially true where the link between tissue
and phenotype may not be immediately obvious. For example, con—
genital dysfibrinogenemia (OMIM:616004) is a blood clotting dis—
order caused by defective fibrinogen genes FGB, FCC and FGA.
Circulating factors affecting blood clotting are synthesized by hep—
atocytes, and indeed, our data show that fibrinogen genes are highly
and exclusively expressed in the liver (Supplementary Fig. S3a).
However, GeneTiER would not identity these disease genes if the
user failed to take this into account and selected blood, rather than
liver, as the affected tissue.

Narcolepsy—cataplexy (ORPHANET:2073) is a sleep disorder
with multiple causative genes identified. GeneTiER scores a number
of these highly, for example MOG and ZNF365, due to localized
expression in parts of the brain (Supplementary Fig. S3b). However,
the disease can have an autoimmune component and in some pa—
tients the phenotype has been attributed to the loss of neurons in the
hypothalamus due to autoimmune attacks. Consequently, our meth—
odology fails to identify histocompatibility genes HLA-DQBI and
HLA-DRBI as causative genes for the disease and may find other
phenotypes arising from heterogeneous causes challenging
(Supplementary Fig. 3c).

Similarly, GeneTiER will not be able to identify disease genes
that are expressed exclusively in tissues not present in our dataset.
Similarly, diseases caused by genes that are expressed in response to
either an environmental stimulus or within a short development
time frame will not perform well if the appropriately stimulated tis—
sue is absent from our dataset.

In spite of these challenges, there are numerous cases where the
observed phenotype correlates with the site of expression exceed—
ingly well. For example, renal tubular dysgenesis (OMIM:267430)
is characterized by a congenital abnormality of the kidneys, with
low amniotic ﬂuid during pregnancy. The protein associated with
the disease, REN, is produced mostly by juxtaglomerular cells of the

kidney. The data in GeneTiER database agree with this, showing
elevated expression in the kidney, as well as a secondary major site
of expression in the placenta (Supplementary Fig. S3d).

Our testing indicates that our gene prioritization method is cap—
able of meaningful candidate gene prioritization and performs
strongly in a substantial proportion of cases tested. GeneTiER aims
to highlight genes with tissue—specific expression patterns to the user
from among other candidate genes in their dataset, and as such will
perform best for diseases with distinct, localized phenotypes.
Nevertheless, a broad selection of tissues allows for scoring of com—
plex phenotypes affecting any combination of tissues. We believe
GeneTiER offers great utility value to the research community and
can effectively supplement the in silico toolbox of any researcher.

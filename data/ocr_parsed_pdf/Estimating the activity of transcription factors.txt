ABSTRACT

Motivation: Understanding regulation of transcription is central for
elucidating cellular regulation. Several statistical and mechanistic
models have come up the last couple of years explaining gene tran-
scription levels using information of potential transcriptional regulators
as transcription factors (T F5) and information from epigenetic modifi-
cations. The activity of TFs is often inferred by their transcription levels,
promoter binding and epigenetic effects. However, in principle, these
methods do not take hard-to-measure influences such as post-tran-
scriptional modifications into account.

Results: For TFs, we present a novel concept circumventing this
problem. We estimate the regulatory activity of TFs using their cumu-
lative effects on their target genes. We established our model using
expression data of 59 cell lines from the National Cancer Institute. The
trained model was applied to an independent expression dataset of
melanoma cells yielding excellent expression predictions and eluci-
dated regulation of melanogenesis.

Availability and implementation: Using mixed-integer linear pro-
gramming, we implemented a switch-like optimization enabling a con-
strained but optimal selection of TFs and optimal model selection
estimating their effects. The method is generic and can also be applied
to further regulators of transcription.

1 INTRODUCTION

Understanding regulation mechanisms of a cell is fundamental
for biomedical research, and transcription factors (TFs) are the
central regulators of gene expression. Through identiﬁcation of
TF binding, the regulatory role of TFs can be inferred. Hence,
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) techniques pulling down
DNA fragments binding to the TF were developed and scaled up
using microarrays (ChIP—chip) and sequencing techniques (ChIP-
seq). Genome-wide data have been produced from this for a
large set of TFs and several cell systems stored in larger data
repositories [e.g. (Lachmann et al., 2010)]. However the speciﬁc
cellular context under study usually does not match the experi-
mental background of the deposited data. In addition, TF

binding need not necessarily lead to a regulatory impact of the
TF, in particular if the target gene is not expressed at all. Hence,
computational approaches have been developed using these data
to apply it to gene expression data of the studied cells. For in-
stance, Cheng and co-workers (Cheng et al., 2012) used machine
learning methods and a linear model to predict regulators ex-
plaining gene expression. They used ChIP-seq/ChIP—chip data
from the ENCODE project and identiﬁed distinctive regulation
principles of generic and speciﬁc TFs, TFs binding preferentially
to Cst and cell type specificity. Interestingly, their method was
challenged when predicting transcription levels of genes under
complex cellular control, such as cell cycle genes. ChIP data
have been used to compile position-weight matrices, which
were used to scan the genome for TF-speciﬁc binding motifs
(Dunham et al., 2012; Kranz, et al., 2011) independent of the
cellular context. However, this method comes along with high
false-positive rates. Modelling techniques were applied to ﬁlter
out such non-functional predictions. Setty et a]. (2012) used a
sparse linear model explaining gene expression. Their model was
based on TF binding site predictions in promoters and miRNAs
in the 3’UTR (UTR, untranslated region) aiming to predict regu-
lators leading to glioblastoma tumour formation.

Techniques were designed to elucidate regulation principles
between TFs and their putative target genes. The algorithm for
the reconstruction of accurate cellular networks [ARACNE
(Jang et al., 2013; Margolin et al., 2006)] and the context likeli-
hood of relatedness [CLR (Faith et al., 2007)] both use the tran-
scription level of a TF to estimate its activity by calculating
Pearson’s correlation or mutual information to its target genes.
ARACNE and CLR were combined and successfully applied to
identify target genes for Nrf2 in murine lungs in response to
oxidative stress (Taylor et al., 2008). However, there are many
steps between mRNA translation of a TF and the actual tran-
scriptional regulation of target genes. The TF can be post-trans-
lationally modified, i.e. it can be methylated, ubiquinated or
phosphorylated. Phosphorylations are often necessary for dimer-
ization and binding to the target gene’s promoter. It was shown
that such modiﬁcations can have a substantial impact on TFs
regulating their target genes (Filtz et al., 2014; Tootle and Rebay,
2005). The underlying concept that expression of the target genes
depends mainly on the mRNA gradients of their regulating TFs
is often violated, in particular in higher eukaryotes. It was shown

that regulation of TFs on the protein level plays a substantial
role for hypoxia-inducible factors (Min et al., 2002) and p53
(Harris et al., 2010). Furthermore, TFs can interact, they can
regulate other TFs directly, if a TF binds to a promoter of an-
other regulator, or indirectly, if the expression of modifying en-
zymes such as kinases is altered. Hence, the expression level of a
TF is often not suitable to describe its activity. More suitable
readouts are the expression levels of the TF’s targets because all
these effects are integrated.

In contrast to previous attempts, we based our predictions on
the eﬁ’ects t0 the direct target genes of the TFs. We estimated the
activity of a TF using a global approach, i.e. regarding the regu-
lation of all its target genes. It is to note that this also accounts
for the fact that in different cells a TF can have a different impact
on its targets (Fig. 1).

Typically, several TFs can bind to a gene’s promoter and dif-
ferent TFs may compete for binding sites. To model this, we used a
linear approach. Similarly to previous studies (Cheng et al., 2012;
Dong et al., 2012; Setty et al., 2012), the models were optimized by
predicting gene expression based on putative regulators (TFs) and
their predicted impact. More than a decade ago, one of the first
systems biology approaches was established using constraint-
based modelling to integrate stoichiometric equations under equi-
librium conditions (Savinell and Palsson, 1992; Schuster et al.,
1999). For this, the mathematical concept of mixed-integer
linear programming (MILP) was used. Shachar and co-workers
used MILP for calculating Steiner trees combining shortest paths
in signalling networks of yeast (Shachar et al., 2008). We used the
same mathematical concept to assemble signalling and biochem-
ical pathways for recognition of transcriptional patterns
(Schramm et al., 2010). Now, we used this technique for elabo-
rated regulation models to elucidate regulation mechanisms. In
contrast to a sparse lasso approach, MILP allowed us to (i) get
an optimized selection of TFs for a predeﬁned number of param-
eters and to (ii) use a switching concept, which enabled the opti-
mization algorithm to decide for each TF to be modelled by its
cumulative effect on the target genes (activity) or its gene expres-
sion level (TF- gene expression). This concept allowed an unbiased
and TF-speciﬁc comparison of the two approaches.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

Statistical analysis and processing of the data were performed using R
version 3.0.1 (www.r-project.org). To solve the constraint-based models
for the prediction of gene expression, the Gurobi Optimizer 5.5 was used
(www.gurobi.com).

expression of all target genes for a certain TF was used to deﬁne the
actual activity of this TF

2.1 Gene expression data

We implemented and analysed our method using the gene expression
proﬁles of 59 cancer cell lines from the National Cancer Institute
(NCI-60 panel). The NCI-60 panel contains 60 cancer cell lines of nine
different origins, breast, central nervous system, colon, kidney, leukae-
mia, lung, melanoma, ovary and prostate (Liu et al., 2010; Shoemaker,
2006). The data were downloaded from CellMiner (Reinhold et al., 2012)
and based on an integration of ﬁve different microarray platforms (5-
Platform, Affymetrix HG—U95, HG-U133, HG-U133 Plus 2.0, GH Exon
1.0 ST and Agilent WHG) yielding a z-score for each gene of each sample
[details, see (Reinhold et al., 2012)]. Missing values were replaced by the
mean expression values of the according genes. The cell line SF 539 was
excluded from our analysis because of a large number (10404) of not-
deﬁned entries. As a second, independent dataset, we used gene expres-
sion data of melanoma cells from the study of Hoek et a]. (2006). In brief,
melanoma cells were released from tissue sections of melanoma metas-
tases. Cells were cultured, total RNA was extracted, labelled and proﬁled
using Affymetrix HG-U133 plus 2.0 oligonucleotide microarrays.
The raw intensity signal was normalized using Affymetrix MAS 5.0.
Values below 0.01 were set to 0.01 and each value was divided by the
50th percentile of all values in that sample. Each expression value was
divided by the median of its values in all samples. Finally, expression
values were z-norrnalized for each gene. For our analysis, we used
expression data of 33 samples from the Mannheim cohort [details, see
(Hoek et al., 2006)].

2.2 Assembling predeﬁned regulatory interactions

As a basis for inferring TF regulation, we used TF binding information
from several sources. From the database MetaCoreTM (http://thomson-
reuters.com/metacore/), human TF-target gene interactions annotated as
activation and inhibition were used, of both of the categories direct and
indirect. Further, we used z-scores of the total binding afﬁnity (TBA),
which uses a TF binding proﬁle for the whole promoter based on position
weight matrices (Molineris et al., 2011). Human entries of the CHIP
Enrichment Analysis (ChEA) database were used, which contained a
large set of data from high-throughput ChIP experiments (Lachmann
et al., 2010). At the date of use (July 2013), the ChEA database for
human comprised 83 TFs, 20 035 genes and 131 996 total entries. In add-
ition, we used ChIP data from the ENCODE project (http:// www.
genome.gov/Encode/). We used binding information of cell lines for
which the most comprehensive set of regulation information was avail-
able (Tier 1), i.e. from the cell lines Gm12878, H1 human embryonic stem
cells, Hela3, HepG2 and K562. We yielded a binding matrix containing
values of ones if binding of a TF to a target gene was listed in Encode and
zero otherwise. If a target gene occurred more than once, the according
rows were combined to a single row containing consistent hits. If a TF
occurred more than once, the according columns were combined to one
column using the union of hits. With all these databases, we assembled
regulation information for 1120 TFs. A regulatory interaction informa-
tion between a TF and a target gene was considered to be reliable if (i)
this pair was found in Metacore with the annotation ‘direct’ or if (ii) this
pair was found in at least two of the datasets Metacore ‘indirect’, ChEA,
Encode and TBA with a value :1. For these pairs, their putative regu-
latory interaction called edge strength in the following was set to the
number of occurrences of the speciﬁc TFegene pair of the datasets
CheA, Metacore direct activation, Metacore direct inhibition, Metacore
indirect activation and Metacore indirect inhibition. Furthermore, the
TBA value :1 was added to the edge strength. For all TFegene pairs
not fulﬁlling criteria (i) or (ii), the edge strength was set to 0.

between the measured gene expression values g], for genes 1' expressed in

program (Gurobi 5.5) was to calculate the ,B-coefﬁcients within
the scope given by the constraints to minimize the sum of error terms.
The lit-coefﬁcients were not constrained and hence could get positive or
negative values.

2.4 Calculating the estimated effects of TFs

expression).

2.5 The model switch

To combine the two models of activity and TF-gene expression, we put
up a switch in which the solver could choose for each TF which definition
of TF effects eff“, to use. For this, further constraints were added to the
model. Each eff“, within the sum of (5) was replaced by

The new variables [Sam and ﬁg), were Boolean variables to select ac-
tivity (6) or TF-gene expression (7) for each TF in the sum of (5).
Constrains

:Bacm + 18g! :1 (10)

ensured that only one of the deﬁnitions was used for each TF.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Distribution of activity and TF—gene expression

Our model based on the assumption that regulatory effects of
each of the TFs in the model contribute additively, either by a
positive term (activating effect of the TF) or negative term (in-
hibiting effect). Hence, the activity deﬁnition needed to be sym-
metric and ideally Gaussian distributed. Even though a perfect
Gaussian distribution was not seen, we found our activity values
showing a rather symmetric distribution, enabling a balanced
usability for activation and inhibition (Supplementary Fig.
Sla). Similarly, the TF gene expression values were also rather
symmetrically distributed (Supplementary Fig. Slb).

3.2 Comparing the prediction performance using activity
and TF—gene expression

To get a representative gene set known to be regulated by a
larger set of TFs, which, in turn, are known to regulate several
target genes, we selected target genes with at least 10 predeﬁned
regulatory interactions of TFs that, in turn, are known to regu-
late at least ﬁve genes. This yielded 636 target genes of 521 TFs.
For the model, the maximal number of TF coefﬁcients unequal
to zero was set to six to avoid overﬁtting. Overﬁtting could have
occurred when all TFs were used (exemplarily shown in the
Supplementary Fig. S5). This restriction was implemented by
including further constraints (see Supplementary Method S1).
For each investigated gene, a respective regulation model was
built. Performing a cross validation (CV) (leave-one-out; leave-
one-out cross validation (LOO-CV) was used throughout the
study) yielded a distinctively better performance using our activ-
ity deﬁnition when compared with TF-gene expression for esti-
mating the effect of TFs. For the activity, an average Pearson
correlation of prediction and measured expression (from the
microarrays) of Pearson Correlation Coefﬁcient PCC r = 0.61
using LOO-CV was obtained. Similar results (PCC r = 0.59)
were obtained using a 10-fold CV (with 10 reiterations). To
test whether the expression of the target genes inﬂuence the pre-
diction performance, we performed the modelling excluding the
target gene expression from the calculation of the activity. This
resulted in an average PCC of r = 0.59 (10-fold CV). So the
effect of including the target gene in the calculation of the activity
did not effect the prediction performance. In comparison with

the models using the activity, the correlation was only PCC
r = 0.41 (LOO-CV) when using TF-gene expression.

3.3 Embedding a model switch

Overall, the activity led to a better performance than just the
transcription levels of the TFs. Still, for some TFs, TF-gene ex-
pression yielded a better prediction performance than our activ-
ity deﬁnition. Therefore, we implemented a model switch as
follows. We added additional coefﬁcients and constraints to
the regulation model. For each TF, a binary switch was included
into the model. Those switches enabled the optimizer to decide
whether to use the activity or the TF-gene expression value of a
TF (for further details, see Section 2). Note that, using such new
binary coefﬁcients, we took advantage of the powerful solver
implementations for mixed-integer programming problems.
This improved the performance to some extent when compared
with using the activity alone (PCC r = 0.63). We studied the
results in more detail (a list of all investigated genes and their
average usage of activity and TF-gene expression is given in the
Supplementary Table S1). For each gene, we counted how often
activity for each TF and how often TF-gene expression was se-
lected by the model. We found that a striking majority was
modelled using the activity definition. For ~95% of all studied
TFs, the activity was preferred. Figure 3 shows the complete
distribution. Next, we wanted to characterize those TFs whose
effects could better be estimated by the optimizer using our ac-
tivity definition and those TFs for which their TF-gene expres-
sion was selected. The TFs with the highest impact (highest
number of putative target genes) and for which the activity def-
inition was more often selected when compared with TF-gene
expression are shown in Table 1.

Table 1 shows central regulators of the cell comprising regu-
lation mainly of cell cycle [MYC, E2F, STATs, RELB (NFKB),
JUN, p53, CEBBA], but also apoptosis [p53, RELB (NFKB),
differentiation (EGRl), immune response (CEBBP) and metab-
olism (HIF1A)]. Interestingly, TFs that were mainly modelled by
their gene expression were much lower connected
(Supplementary Table S1). The most connected TFs of this
group (modelled by TF-gene expression) were sex determining
region Yibox 10 (SOX10, involved in differentiation, neurogen—
esis, embryogenesis), interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and
sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1
(SREBFl). In summary, besides a qualitative bias for cell cycle
for the activity group of TFs, we could not see a clear overall
tendency. Hence, we performed a gene set enrichment analysis of
the target genes for TFs modelled by activity or their gene ex-
pression. Target genes representing the activity group (TOA

genes, targets of activity-modelled TFs) were selected if they
were targeted by at least one TF, which was always modelled
by its activity. Genes were discarded from this list if they were
also regulated by TFs being modelled by TF-gene expression for
at least 50% of their targets. The background was deﬁned by all
target genes for which we had at least one entry of putative
regulation of the 521 TFs we investigated (10331 genes). With
this we obtained a list of 1667 TOA genes. For the TF-gene
expression group (TOG genes, targets of TF-gene expression
modelled TFs), the criterion was relaxed to obtain a reasonable
number of target genes. Genes were selected if they were regu-
lated by at least one TF, which was at least for 50% of its target
modelled by its gene expression. Genes were discarded from this
list if they were also regulated by TFs being entirely modelled by
activity. This yielded 629 TOG genes, i.e. target genes represent-
ing targets of the TF-gene expression TFs (TOG genes, Targets
Of TF-gene expression modelled TFs). Employing Fisher’s exact
tests to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG,
www.genome.jp.kegg) and Gene Ontology Biological Process
(www.geneontology.org) using DAVID (http://david.abcc.
ncifcrf.gov/homejsp), we found 64 signiﬁcantly enriched gene
groups (BenjaminieHochberg corrected) for the TOA genes
(Supplementary Table S2). Interestingly, cell cycle (P = 6.79
E-08), immune response (P = 4.12 E-05) and cell growth and
death (P = 1.96 E-06) appeared supporting the tendency seen
when only regarding the TFs. For the TOG genes, only three
gene groups were enriched comprising sterol, cholesterol and
lipid biosynthesis. Furthermore, we wanted to better understand

the TFs that chose activity for modelling. We selected gene
groups that were regulated by TFs (modelled by activity) for
which the activity and TF-gene expression were well correlated,
and TFs for which activity and TF-gene expression correlated
poor. We identiﬁed 41 TFs with good correlation (PPC r 3 0.5 of
activity versus gene expression) and 215 TFs with rather poor
correlation (r 5 0.1). For both groups of TFs, all putative target
genes were selected, and enrichment tests performed for genes
being targets only of well-correlating TFs (1509 target genes) and
only of poor correlating TFs (3783 target genes). For the good
correlating TFs, we did not find any enriched gene groups. We
found two gene groups being enriched for the target genes of the
TFs with poor correlation of activity versus gene expression
(transmission of nerve impulse, synaptic transmission, P = 8.64
E-03, Supplementary Table S2).

3.4 Extending the investigations to a larger set of target
genes

We tested the impact of the possibility to choose the activity for a
larger gene set and relaxed the restriction deﬁnitions for the
target genes. Relaxing the selection criterion to genes with, at
least, ﬁve known TFs regulating them yielded a list of 1681
target genes. For the pure activity model, we yielded an average
prediction performance of PCC r = 0.46 and for the pure TF-
gene expression model r = 0.33, conﬁrming that the activity ap-
proach led to better predictions. Using the combined strategy
(with the model switch), the average prediction performance
was r = 0.48. Again, from the solved models, the coefﬁcient
values were read out. For each gene, it was counted how often
a TF coefﬁcient got the activity as the chosen parameter and how
often the TF’s gene expression was chosen. Similar to the smaller
gene set described above, the activity was selected for the major-
ity of TFs. Again, for ~95% of all studied TFs the activity was
preferred by the optimizer. Supplementary Figure S2 in the sup-
plement shows the complete distribution.

3.5 Investigating the regulation of melanogenesis in
melanocytes and validating the predictions using a
second dataset

We applied the improved regulation model (using the model
switch) to a case study and investigated regulation of melanogen-
esis in melanocytes. The NCI-60 panel also contained 10 melan-
oma cell lines. To get distinct regulation levels of these cells,
again, the whole set of cell lines was used. A t-test was performed
to find those genes of melanogenesis (pathway deﬁnitions were

taken from KEGG) that were differentially expressed and sig-
niﬁcantly up-regulated in melanoma cells compared with the
other cancer cells. The differentially expressed genes of this path-
way are shown in Table 2. Indeed, genes TYR and DCT, which
encode the pacemaker enzymes (Supplementary Fig. S3) of mel-
anogenesis, were significantly up-regulated. Also, the gene
coding for microphthalmia—associated transcription factor
(MITF) was highly differentially expressed. The latter is the
key regulator of melanocytes and melanoma cells and DCT
and TYR are targets of MITF (Levy et al., 2006). Endothelin
receptor type B (EDNRB) was also highly up-regulated. The
g-proteinecoupled EDNRB is another central regulator of mel-
anogenesis. Activation of EDNRB activates MITF or its tran-
scription (Ho et al., 2010). To elucidate the regulation of these
four genes, the regulation models were set up based on the NCI-
60 panel. We used a 10-fold CV to estimate the prediction per-
formances, as the small number of putative regulators for DCT
and TYR could have led to overﬁtting using LOO-CV. We ob-
tained excellent performance results (e.g. DCT: PCC r = 0.85,
MITF: PCC r = 0.80, see Table 2). Next, we used the learned
models to predict gene expression of the genes from this pathway
in a new set of 33 melanoma cell lines [taken from (Hoek et al.,
2006)]. Note that this second dataset was normalized and ana-
lysed entirely independent from the ﬁrst dataset (see Section 2).
Strikingly, very good prediction performances were still ob-
tained, e.g. for DCT we yielded PCC r = 0.80 and for TYR
PCC r = 0.60 (Table 2). The values of real and predicted gene
expression for the four used genes are illustrated in
Supplementary Figure S4. The predicted TFs for the up-regu—
lated genes of the melanogenesis pathway are mainly connected
to the key regulator MITF. For example, paired box 3 (PAX3)
activates the transcription of MITF, which promotes the expres-
sion of TYR and DCT. Subsequently, PAX3 competes with
MITF for the binding site of the DCT promoter (Harris et al.,
2010). POU domain, class 3, transcription factor 2 (POU3F2) is
another regulator of MITF. Normally, it represses the MITF
promoter. However, mutation in BRAF, which is very
common in melanoma, leads to an increased kinase activity
that provokes the transcription of MITF via POU3F2
(W ellbrock et al., 2008). Another activating regulator is the TF
one cut homeo box 2 (ONECUT2). By binding to the MITF
promoter, it stimulates the transcription (Jacquemin et al.,
2001). Overall, the transcriptional regulation of melanogenesis
consists of a complex interplay of activating and inhibiting regu-
lators. Also post-translational modiﬁcations are crucial elements,
which can also reverse the effect of a TF i.e. as it was described

for POU3F2 (Cook and Sturm, 2008; Harris et al., 2010;
Jacquemin, et al., 2001; Wellbrock, et al., 2008). In summary,
this conﬁrmed our approach to use the cumulative TF’s target
genes expression to estimate the effect of a TF.

4 DISCUSSION

Several elaborated methods have been developed and established
the past couple of years to elucidate cellular regulation of tran-
scription. The models range from highly non-linear approaches
using e.g. Support Vector Machines and Random Forests
(Cheng et al., 2012) to mathematically rather simple linear
models (Dong et al., 2012; Setty et al., 2012). Common to
these approaches is the straightforward concept to gain a
better mechanistic understanding if the models can well predict
known transcript levels after concise selection of putative regu-
latory information. This information ranges from TFs binding at
promoters and enhancers, miRNA seeds and, now highly inves-
tigated, a large variety of epigenetic modiﬁcations of histones
and DNA. The task is challenging, as transcriptional regulation
is highly complex, and all these approaches cover only the tip of
the iceberg. Assuming that regulation principles are redundant,
they may well be modelled even if basing on data that gives
insight to only parts of this machinery. However, these investi-
gations often do not cover post-transcriptional control as this
comes along with more demanding experimental efforts, and
such control is intrinsically distinct from functional genomics
regulation. Our activity concept is one approach to circumvent
this. It integrates the underlying general inﬂuence of a single
regulator by using the information of differential expression of
all its putative targets, assuming to be e.g. highly active when
strong effects at the targets are observed. Of course, this ap-
proach is only a starting point for more elaborate models as
this, again, is based on putative regulatory interactions inferred
from other cellular contexts. A future aspect is to iteratively im-
prove the initial regulation assumptions by e.g. using Bayesian
statistics, coupled with an expectation-maximization algorithm.
Nevertheless, we obtained excellent performance results when
validating our predictions by cross validation, and even when
applying our trained machines to a completely unseen dataset
(e.g. for DCT gene: PCC r = 0.8 when comparing the model
predictions to the measured gene expression). Astonishingly,
our approach was the method of choice to predict regulation
of cell cycle genes. It was mentioned previously that regulation
of cell cycle genes is difﬁcult to model, as these genes are involved
in a complex, post-transcriptional machinery (Cheng et al.,
2012). At least to some extent, our method may approach this
challenge.

To keep the model simple, it was restricted to regions proximal
to the transcription start site (TSS). However, distal binding at
enhancers support transcriptional regulation. A future task can
be the inclusion of distal binding information provided by the
Encode project in addition to the Encode data we used for prox-
imal binding to the TSS. New coefficients could be added for
enhancers with a positively restricted ﬂ-value, due to the activat-
ing effect of enhancers, and negative ﬂ-values for silencers.
Phenotypic traits can be inferred by transcriptional gene signa-
tures. For example, Kerwin et al. used gene signatures known to
associate with deﬁned circadian time phases to examine natural

variation of the circadian clock (Kerwin et al., 2011). In contrast
to these approaches, we rather constructed a mechanistic model
of cellular regulation. We used signatures of gene groups (target
genes of a TF) mostly basing on experimental evidence of a direct
physical interaction (ChIP) with the mediator (T F), which itself
interacts directly with the gene causing the investigated trait (its
gene expression). We used a linear approach to infer regulation
principles. Linear models are commonly applied for this [e.g.
(Setty et al., 2012)]. Dong et al. (2012) compared linear with
non-linear models (random forests, multivariate adaptive regres-
sion splines) and got similar prediction accuracies. In contrast,
Cheng and co-workers (Cheng et al., 2012) compared four dif-
ferent approaches and got better results using the non-linear
methods. As an outlook, we plan to investigate the activity ap-
proach within linear and non-linear models. Segal et al. (2008)
followed a similar modelling concept, i.e. estimating the effect of
a TF by minimizing the error term of prediction and measured
gene expression. As experimental data, they used binding site
information, concentration data of the TFs and the promoter-
sequence for the investigated target genes. Interestingly, they also
modelled co-operativity of TFs assuming that the strength of
such interactions depends on the distance between the bound
TFs. We plan to integrate such an approach in future studies.
We used the established framework of MILP. MILP facilitated
(i) the selection of TFs and (ii) the individual selection how to
optimally model them (by their cumulative effects we termed
activity or by their transcript levels). With this, the biological
diversity of gene expression’s regulation could be modulated
more precisely. But still, several assumptions were made to
keep the model simple, neglecting e.g. epigenetic modiﬁcations.
New coefﬁcients and parameters can be added to include those
factors. But this may come along with increased complexity of
the model and may lead to wrong conclusions due to misleading
arrangements of redundant information. If the final aim was
only to predict gene expression, such an extension is straightfor-
ward. But the task of this regulation model was mainly to reveal
regulators with high impact on the regulation of the gene under
study. For example, for the genes TYR and DCT, which are the
pacemaker enzymes of melanin biosynthesis in melanocytes, a
regulation model based on a TF network was successfully gen-
erated. Using this regulation model, already well known TFs
were identiﬁed as substantial regulators, but, for DCT, also the
less prominent regulator SOX5 was found. It has been reported
that SOX5 interferes activation of DCT by SOX10, hence in-
hibiting expression of DCT (Harris et al., 2010). However, for
the cell lines in our study, we found positive terms for SOX5 in
our model (positive ﬂ-values, data not shown). Subsequent spe-
ciﬁc experimental validation may elucidate SOX5’s regulatory
role for DCT in these cell lines. MILP allowed us to introduce
several switches into our originally linear models (switches: se-
lection of TFs, selection of the models of their effects). Note that
embedding such switches lead to a non-linear and non-convex
topology of the search space for these models. This may be
compared with a piecewise linear slope (linear part of the
model) with substantial breakpoints coming from an abrupt
error reduction when switches are used. To some extent, this
compares with drastic observations in cell biology as e. g. apop-
tosis and immortalization at which smoothly (‘linear’) a point-of-
no-return is approached after which the destiny of the cell

changes (apoptosis: cell death, in turn, immortalization: malig-
nancy). To our knowledge, such events have not been elaborately
described for transcriptional regulation and this would be intri-
guing research for the future.

Our approach is generic and can be employed also using other
sources of regulation information such as epigenetic modiﬁca-
tions and miRNA regulation.

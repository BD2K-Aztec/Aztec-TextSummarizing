coverage. Nevertheless, processed reads per unit of time re—
mained constant (~500 000 reads per minute). SpalPred—inferred
SIT numbers matched the experimental ones for 39 samples
(88.6%). The resulting octal codes from both in silica approaches
were identical for 42 (95.5%) of the 44 samples with experimental
results (see Supplementary Table S1 for detailed results). In the
remaining two isolates, ([2 nova assembly failed to detect spacer
25, which happens to fall between contiguous assembled contigs.
The overall five non—matched in silica and experiment results
were due to the increased in silica sensitivity of the detection of
spacer 15 in the five samples and, additionally, spacer 26 in one
sample. When the original hybridization blots were checked, an
irregular signal distribution for spacer 15 across all samples was
noted. Some signals were either too faint or just not detectable to
be manually assigned as being present. Although predicted spo—
ligotypes remained unchanged for samples 26 and 48, the other
three (25, 40 and 49), which had octal codes not previously
reported in the SITVITWEB database, were re—assigned to dif—
ferent spoligotypes. Interestingly, these three isolates are consist—
ently clustered in the SNP—based dendogram, i.e. within a clade
of samples having the same experimental type. Similarly, all sam—
ples with no laboratory data were clustered with isolates of the
same predicted spoligotype (Fig. 1).

Although SNPs and other genetic variation derived from sequen—
cing projects are likely to become the markers of choice due to
their discriminatory power, PCR genotyping techniques are still
widely employed. In this regard, SpalPred will enable the com—
plementary comparison of computationally inferred spoligotypes
with laboratory results. Currently, the tedious parameter opti—
mization and computational requirements for ([2 nova assembly
are important constraints. Only 42 (95.5%) spoligotypes could
be accurately inferred using the ([2 nova strategy implemented.
The region in the DR locus harbouring spacer 25 does not seem
to be reconstructed in two genomes, resulting in an incorrect type
classiﬁcation. Importantly, in those five samples for which
SpalPred and experimental patterns differ, predicted octal
codes were exactly the same when using both computational
approaches. Furthermore, the newly assigned spoligotypes
(namely, isolates 25, 40 and 49 in Fig. 1) are clustered with
other isolates having coincident experimental and in silica pre—
dicted lineages. The absent sequence responsible for the discre—
pancies observed, namely, spacer 15, was the same across all five
problematic isolates. The ambiguous distinction of this spacer
has been reported (Abadia et al., 2011) and explained in terms
of the presence of a 4—nt deletion adjacent to the amplified se—
quence (van Embden et al., 2000), which would not allow a
proper primer hybridization. Other ambiguities caused by the
insertion of IS6110 copies in the DR region have also been re—
ported (Filliol et al., 2000). As demonstrated, the software can be
employed to accurately and quickly confirm experimentally
determined spoligotypes, infer them from sequenced isolates
with no laboratory data and reveal unexpected cases of wrongly
assigned types. Other causes of TB misclassif1cation such as la—
boratory cross contamination, PCR contamination or ambigu—
ous hybridization patterns could also be clarified. With the
amount of sequence data increasingly growing, software like
SpalPred will be useful additions to pipelines used to infer TB

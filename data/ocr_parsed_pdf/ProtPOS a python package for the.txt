Abstract

Summary: Atomistic molecular dynamics simulation is a promising technique to investigate the
energetics and dynamics in the protein—surface adsorption process which is of high relevance to
modern biotechnological applications. To increase the chance of success in simulating the adsorp—
tion process, favorable orientations of the protein at the surface must be determined. Here, we pre—
sent ProtPOS which is a lightweight and easy—to—use python package that can predict low—energy
protein orientations on a surface of interest. It combines a fast conformational sampling algorithm
with the energy calculation of GROMACS. The advantage of ProtPOS is it allows users to select any
force fields suitable for the system at hand and provide structural output readily available for fur—
ther simulation studies.

1 Introduction

Understanding the mechanisms of protein adsorption on surfaces is
important for many biotechnological applications, such as the de—
sign of medical implants, protein biochips, drug delivery systems
and point—of—care devices, etc. By virtue of molecular modeling and
simulations, the protein adsorption processes, its dynamics and sub—
sequent protein—surface interactions can be studied at the molecular
or atomic level of detail. However, a successful simulation of the ad—
sorption process depends largely on the initial protein orientation
relative to the surface (Wei et (11., 2012). To avoid sampling protein
trajectory which will eventually fail to adsorb, a work—around is to
firstly determine the preferred orientations of the protein and use
them as starting structures in molecular simulations.

Essentially, a search for the low—energy protein orientation on a
given surface is an optimization process which includes a conformation
generation strategy and a scoring function. For the former, a systematic
rotation (and translation) of the protein or a Monte Carlo simulation is
commonly used (Hsu et (11., 2008; Xie et (11., 2010; Zheng et (11., 2004).
For this structure determination problem, a simplified scoring function

accounting for only protein—surface interactions is usually preferred for
higher computational efficiency. Interaction parameters can be taken
from an empirical force field or modification from the scoring function
of a docking method (Sun et (11., 2005). Interestingly, unlike other
structure prediction problems such as protein—ligand docking or pro—
tein—protein docking where numerous tools exist to simplify the predic—
tion task, there are only limited choices available for fast protein—
surface structure prediction. One such option is RosettaSurface
(Makrodimitris et (11., 2007) which is included in the Rosetta molecular
modeling package, and hence the use of RosettaSurface entails a deep
learning curve. Other prediction methods mentioned above, to our
knowledge, are unavailable publicly for general use.

Hence, to fill this gap, we have developed a self—contained, light—
weight and easy—to—use software package called prediction of PROTein
Preferred Orientation on a Surface (ProtPOS) based on the protein—sur—
face docking method described in (Ngai et (11., 2015). It combines par—
ticle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm (Kennedy and Eberhart,
1995) with energy minimization to perform global and local search
over six degrees of freedom of the protein translation and rotation on

a given surface. The advantage of ProtPOS is that it allows users to se—
lect any force ﬁelds suitable for the system at hand, to be provided as
inputs in the format of GROMACS topology together with the protein
and surface coordinates. In this way, predicted low energy protein con—
formations are compatible to the selected force field and readily avail—
able for further molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

2 Implementation

ProtPOS is a package of open—source shell scripts and Python pro—
grams utilizing the PyMOL library for conformation generation and
the popular MD simulation software GROMACS for energy mini—
mization and scoring. The workﬂow of ProtPOS is explained in
Fig. 1. To facilitate ease—of—use, a template wrapper script is pro—
vided through which users can customize parameters for the search
algorithm, perform prediction and clustering analysis. During the
search, all rotational angles around the protein center of mass are
allowed. For surfaces with repeating surfacial patterns, lateral trans—
lation (X and Y directions) of the protein can be restrainted to
defined ranges, typically the dimensions of the surface unit cell;
whereas the translation along the surface normal (Z) is set to be
[1.0, 5.5)  from the surface, i.e. the interfacial region where pro—
tein—surface interactions are significant. If contacting residues are
known a priori, they can be given to ProtPOS to limit further the

Residue Iteration

Fig. 1. The workflow of ProtPOS: First, the user has to prepare the initial pro-
tein and surface coordinates in two separate PDB files. The molecular topolo-
gies in GROMACS format can be generated directly using pdeng and the
automated topology building software such as ATB web server. The Python
program simplePSO.py generates a population of different protein positions
and orientations with respect to the surface; each of them will undergo en-
ergy minimization and scoring until better protein orientation cannot be
found within defined number of iterations or the maximum number of iter-
ations is reached. The lowest energy structure (gbest.pdb) is then reported to-
gether with the search trajectory. The latter can be fed to simpleANS.py to
produce the protein—surface minimum distance profile and the plot of energy
evolution. Therefore, each complete run reports one lowest energy structure.
Due to the stochastic nature of the P80 algorithm, the user should repeat
ProtPOS 10—15 times (see Supplementary information) and perform cluster-
ing analysis to identify unique low-energy protein orientations (Color version
of this figure is available at Bioinformatics online.)

search on the specified protein surface. It should be mentioned that,
for better computational efficiency, the Generalized Born implicit
solvent model (GBSA) is used during energy minimization and only
nonbonded interactions between the protein and the surface are
included in scoring.

3 Validation and performance

ProtPOS was tested by predicting the initial adsorption orientations
of lysozyme on a hydrophobic surface of perﬂuorodecane molecules.
The results were compared to experiments and previous computa—
tional studies qualitatively and found good agreement (See
Supplementary Table S1). Furthermore, the selected low—energy
structures were subjected to 50 ns MD simulations in order to assess
the stability of the protein orientations. In three out of four cases,
the proteins maintained the predicted orientations and stably at—
tached to the surface (Supplementary Table S2) whereas in one case
the protein was rotated slightly keeping three contacting residues
same as in the initial orientation and remain stably attached
throughout the remaining simulation time. MD simulations of ran—
domly selected protein orientations either resulting in the protein
converted to predicted orientation or diffused away from the sur—
face, suggesting that ProtPOS predicted structures serve as good
starting structures for further simulation studies.

Regarding the time performance, our test case running on a con—
sumer—grade desktop computer (with Intel i7—4790 3.6 GHz CPU and
16 GB memory) took about 1 day to complete one ProtPOS run, with
an average of 81.5 iterations to reach convergence in the PS0 search.
The most expensive calculation is the energy minimization step which
is done for all PSO particles in each iteration. Future improvement on
ProtPOS should consider pre—filtering of highly unfavorable orienta—
tions before performing energy minimziation, as well as parallelizing
the PS0 algorithm by multicore CPU and advanced GPU techniques.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Robust large-scale sequence analysis is a major chal-
lenge in modern genomic science, where biologists are frequently
trying to characterize many millions of sequences. Here, we describe
a new Java-based architecture for the widely used protein function
prediction software package InterProScan. Developments include im-
provements and additions to the outputs of the software and the com-
plete reimplementation of the software framework, resulting in a
flexible and stable system that is able to use both multiprocessor
machines and/or conventional clusters to achieve scalable distributed
data analysis. InterProScan is freely available for download from the
EMBI-EBI FTP site and the open source code is hosted at Google
Code.

Availability and implementation: InterProScan is distributed via FTP
at ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/software/unixﬁprscan/S/ and the source code
is available from http://code.goog|e.com/pﬁnterproscan/.

1 INTRODUCTION

The InterProScan software (Quevillon et al., 2005) is extensively
used both by genome sequencing projects [Suen et al., 2011;
Shulaev et al., 2011; Sato et al., 2011] and the UniProt
Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) (The UniProt Consortium, 2012)
to obtain a ‘ﬁrst—pass’ profile of protein sequences’ potential
functions. It does this by combining together search applications
that predict protein family membership and the presence of func-
tional domains and sites, summarizing their outputs.

Before describing the architecture used by the new version of
InterProScan, it is necessary to explain how these analysis appli-
cations work in a general sense, as it has inﬂuenced the overall
design of the system. Search applications have two main mod-
alities: The simplest [TMHMM (Krogh et al., 2001), SignalP
(Petersen et al., 2011), Phobius (Kall et al., 2004)] have single
algorithms that are used to give a likelihood that a particular
feature exists. Other applications [Pfam (Punta et al., 2012),

TIGRFAMs (Haft et al., 2012), SMART (Letunic et al., 2012),
PIRSF (Wu et al., 2004), Panther (Mi et al., 2012), HAMAP
(Pedruzzi et al., 2012), Prosite (Sigrist et al., 2012), ProDom
(Bru et al., 2005), PRINTS (Attwood et al., 2012), CATH-
Gene3D (Lees et al., 2012) and SUPERFAMILY (De Lima
Morais et al., 2011)] are more complex, searching a sequence
against multiple models, using a variety of algorithms [e.g.
HMMER (Eddy, 2009), BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990)] and
post-processing the raw output of the search algorithm before
a final result is produced (see Fig. 1). Frequently, the algorithms
used are computationally expensive and some kind of paralleliza—
tion is necessary for large numbers of sequences to be analyzed in
a reasonable amount of time. Once the search results are ob-
tained, the InterProScan in-memory database is queried to find
corresponding InterPro (Hunter et al., 2012) entries (i.e. the
entries associated with a particular set of HMMs, etc) and add-
itional database annotations, such as Gene Ontology (The Gene
Ontology Consortium, 2000) terms, are associated with the re-
sults accordingly.

It is imperative that the framework built for managing the
InterProScan analyses is highly conﬁgurable, so that the hetero-
geneous nature of the different applications can be represented
appropriately, and the software can run in a multitude of com-
puting environments. Previous versions of InterProScan (4.x and
earlier) were difﬁcult for users to install and conﬁgure, did not
scale appropriately for the analysis of large numbers of sequences
and the functionality of the software was difﬁcult to extend. This
reimplementation of InterProScan addresses the previous ver-
sions’ weaknesses and adds new features to the software.

2 SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE

The design goals for InterProScan 5 are driven by a wider set of
use cases than existed for InterProScan 4 and earlier versions of
the software package. In common with earlier versions,
InterProScan 5 has been designed to allow the efﬁcient charac-
terization of relatively small numbers of sequences in a single
analysis, including the ability to parallelize search jobs to mini-
mize wall-clock time (as opposed to CPU time).

New to InterProScan 5 is the ability to function on a massive
scale, to allow the analysis and persistence of match data for
millions of sequences under the control of a single ‘Master’

Fig. 1. Comparison of the processing steps used by two different member
database applications, TMHMM and Pfam

process with a high level of parallelization of the analysis steps on
a cluster or supercomputer. This parallelization is done at three
levels: sequence sets can be chunked into smaller sets for analysis
(parallelization at the sequence level), individual analyses (e.g.
Pfam, Prosite, etc) can run on separate threads on the same
CPU, on different CPUs or on different machines (paralleliza-
tion at the application level) and some application binaries, such
as HMMER3, also take advantage of parallel computing (par-
allelization at the binary level). The large-scale mode makes use
of a single relational database to store information about se-
quences (either nucleotide or protein sequences), predictive
models and InterPro content, and the matches predicted by
InterProScan. As InterProScan 5 makes use of the Hibernate
object-relational mapping tool (http://www.hibernate.org/), it
should be possible to port the back-end to run on most relational
database management systems. By default, InterProScan 5 uses a
pure in-memory database, which requires no conﬁguration.

2.1 Overall system architecture

InterProScan 5 has a modular Java-based architecture, which
builds on best-of-breed Java technologies. InterProScan is built
on a rich Java data model that incorporates mappings to both a
relational database schema (using Hibernate) and a new XML
schema (using JAXB). Multiple layers are build on this core,
each with different functionality (e.g. persistence of the data to

a relational database, running of the analyses and farming out of
jobs to computational resources, see Fig. 2).

2.2 Job management

Each analysis is deﬁned as a ‘job’ in InterPro. A job may contain
any number of steps that are deﬁned with dependencies that
allow merging and branching. Both jobs and steps are deﬁned
and wired together in an XML format using a mixture of
common components (e.g. modules to write out FASTA ﬁles
or run binaries) and analysis-speciﬁc components (6. g. modules
to parse algorithm output formats or run analysis-speciﬁc post-
processing).

InterProScan 5 makes use of Java Message Service (JMS) to
manage communication between the components of the archi-
tecture, each of which may be run on separate physical or Virtual
machines (see Fig. 3). This communication system allows
InterProScan 5 to be run on disparate environments, including
a single machine, a local area network, a multi-core supercom-
puter or a managed cluster. The only requirement (at present) is
that the machines share the same ﬁle system. JMS was selected
after a careful review of multiple technologies for building and
running distributed systems. Other evaluated technologies
included MP1 and Hadoop (http://hadoop.apache.org). MPI,
although mature, did not have a well-supported ofﬁcial Java
binding and Hadoop required a set up that was not compatible
with all InterProScan use cases. JMS has proven to be robust,
scalable and reliable for inter-process communications and is a
stable industry standard (JMS version 1.1 was ﬁnalized in April,
2002). InterProScan 5 makes use of the open source Apache
ActiveMQ JMS implementation (http://activemq.apache.org/).

A tiered hub/spoke architecture is used to allow InterProScan
5 to scale to potentially thousands of separate machines. At the
center (hub) of the architecture is a single ‘Master’ process that
dynamically spawns and manages a number of ‘Worker’ nodes.
The Worker nodes consist of Java Virtual Machines (JVMs),
which are able to perform multiple steps from different analyses
during their lifetime. If additional nodes are required due to the
load on the system, new ones will be spawned; once they have
completed their tasks, they expire and free up resources. To
avoid the problem of having too many open direct network con-
nections between the Master and its Workers under heavy load,

Fig. 3. Use of JMS to manage allocation of jobs across a compute re-
source. This ﬁgure shows the primary tier of Master JV M-spawned work-
ers. Jobs are added to a RequestQueue by the Master JVM, and any
available worker JVMs will poll this queue to request work

a Worker can itself spawn a new tier of Workers, if a set limit is
reached; any number of tiers of Workers is allowed.
Consequently, it is possible to run InterProScan 5 with tens of
thousands of worker JV Ms being controlled by a single Master
JVM, allowing the analysis of entire genomes in just hours of
wall-clock time.

To benchmark the software, we used InterProScan version
5144.0 cluster mode to run all InterPro 44.0 member database
and COILS analyses against the Escherichia coli DH10B prote-
ome (3990 sequences) and Arabidopsis thaliana proteome (31 819
sequences). The wall-clock times were 32 and 520 min, respect-
ively. The Ecoli run used 12 workers, whereas the Arabidopsis
run used 67 (each worker used four cores).

Another benefit of the JMS architecture is that it separates the
functioning of the analysis software from the mechanics of the
computer system that InterProScan 5 is running on. If, for ex-
ample, a cluster system wishes to start a JV M on a new machine
but fails to do so, InterProScan 5 is robust and will be unaffected
by this failure. InterProScan has been developed to work with
the cluster queuing management system IBM Platform LSF
(http ://www.ibm.com/systems/technicalcomp uting/platformcom-
puting/products/lsf/), but its structure is generic enough to work
with other systems, including Oracle Grid Engine (http://www.
oracle.com/us/products/tools/oracle-grid—engine-075549.html).

2.3 New analysis algorithm and features

Besides the changes to the overall architecture and organization
of the InterProScan software, a new analysis algorithm and new
features have also been added. Phobius is a ‘combined trans-
membrane topology and signal peptide predictor’ (http://pho
bius.binf.ku.dk/). Its strengths include the ability to discriminate
between the hydrophobic regions of a protein and signal pep-
tides, which are highly similar. This application is freely available
to academic users; however, it requires a license for commercial
use. As a consequence, Phobius is not included in the download-
able version of InterProScan 5, but needs to be obtained separ-
ately from the Phobius Web site and conﬁgured for local use
within InterProScan 5.

InterProScan summarizes the results obtained from running
the separate search applications by checking the InterPro data-
base to see which InterPro entries the matching signatures
(i.e. the underlying models, such as HMMs, ﬁngerprints and

patterns) belong to and reporting these in the output.
Signatures are only integrated into InterPro when they are con-
sidered to be of good quality; if two signatures are found to be
describing the same protein domain, site or family, they are
placed into the same database entry. Integrations are subject to
rigorous checking and careful manual annotation in the form of
both a written abstract and cross-references to the Gene
Ontology. New in InterProScan 5 is the ability to output
which pathways are associated with a particular InterPro entry
(and, by extension, the protein under study). The link between
pathway and entry is determined automatically, by checking if a
significant proportion of proteins matched by an entry (>80%)
are annotated with pathway-related information in UniProtKB.
Enzyme Commission classiﬁcations [EC numbers, http://enzyme.
expasy.org/; (Bairoch, 2000)] and cross-references to pathway
resources such as KEGG [http://www.genome.jp/kegg/;
(Kanehisa, 2013)] are currently available in InterProScan 5.

2.4 Match lookup service

As part of the regular release procedure used to generate the
InterPro database at EMBL-EBI, matches are calculated for
all UniParc protein sequences. These precalculated matches are
made available to InterProScan Via a lookup web service, to
prevent unnecessary and wasteful recalculation. When a se-
quence is submitted to InterProScan for searching, a checksum
of the amino acid sequence is calculated and this is used to query
the lookup web service to see if that sequence has already been
characterized. If it has been characterized, the results are re-
turned to the user; if not, the required analysis jobs are launched.
The lookup service comprises a large Oracle Berkeley DB (Java
edition; http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/products/berke
leydb/overvieo/index-085366.html) database with a lightweight
web application front-end, hosted at EMBL-EBI; it is able
to handle multiple concurrent requests. There is also the
option to download this web application and database to run
locally, if required. This lookup service replaces the indexed
match_complete.xml file used by InterProScan 4.

2.5 Installation and conﬁguration

Previously, installation of InterProScan (4.x) was complex, invol-
ving the download of multiple ﬁles and running of an installation
script, which frequently frustrated users. With InterProScan 5,
we have simpliﬁed the installation by providing a complete dis-
tribution in a single compressed ﬁle, which, once uncompressed
on a supported operating system, can be used immediately. If a
user wishes to further conﬁgure the system to suit their local
environment, they only need to edit a single conﬁguration file,
simplifying the setup process for the software.

3 INTERFACES AND ACCESS

InterProScan 5 is primarily designed to run on the command-
line. Previous downloadable versions included a web interface,
but after a survey, we discovered this feature was only used by a
small proportion of users. As the overhead for maintaining this
interface was relatively high, it has been removed from version 5.
However, users may still obtain a graphical View of their
InterProScan 5 results by using the output format options

Fig. 4. Portion of the graphical output from InterProScan 5. This View of
a protein’s match data is the same in both the HTML and SVG formats

-f HTML or -f SVG. This graphical View is now indistinguishable
from the InterPro database’s protein pages (which display pre-
computed InterPro results against UniProtKB proteins), as
shown in Figure 4.

Multiple other output formats are available, including tab-
delimited (TSV), a new XML format and GFF3 (http://www.
sequenceontology.org/resources/gff3.html). In particular, the
new GFF3 format is useful for users wishing to map protein
sequence feature predictions to both protein and nucleotide se-
quences (if nucleotide sequences were originally submitted to the
search). Users wishing to output their results in a format com-
patible with version 4 of InterProScan (e. g. RAW) are able to use
the ‘-convert’ mode on the InterProScan 5 XML output.

The InterProScan 5 distribution can be downloaded for local
installation from the EMBL-EBI FTP site (ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/
pub/software/unix/iprscan/5/). Users can alternatively search
their sequences using a hosted version Via the InterPro Web
site (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) or SOAP (http://www.ebi.
ac.uk/Tools/services/soap/iprscan5?wsdl) and REST (http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/serVices/rest/iprscan5) web services
(Goujon et al., 2010). The source code is available from a
Google Code repository (http://code.google.com/p/interpros
can/), together with documentation for both developers and
end-users.

It is possible to search both nucleotide and protein sequences
with InterProScan (although the hosted version currently re-
stricts users to being able to search a single protein (not nucleo-
tide) sequence only, for band-width reasons).

4 CONCLUSIONS

InterProScan is a widely used tool for protein (and nucleotide)
sequence analysis. InterProScan does not simply supply a con-
venient way of searching disparate analytical signatures from

different source databases, but it also allows users to obtain a
better overview of what their results mean by adding valuable
information from the InterPro database.

This new implementation of InterProScan aims to address all
of the shortcomings of the previous versions of InterProScan
without losing important functionality. Primarily, the full reim-
plementation of the software into a robust, data model-driven,
Java-based architecture gives considerable improvements in scal-
ability and usability, with the new version much easier to install
and conﬁgure. New features have been added, including the pro-
vision of an additional analysis algorithm (Phobius); new
(GFF3, SVG) and improved (XML, HTML) output formats;
new web services for lookup of precomputed results and the
ability to infer the potential membership of proteins in pathways
(Via InterPro entry mappings to KEGG, MetaCyc, UniPathway,
etc.). The hosting of the source code at Google Code also sig-
niﬁes a signiﬁcant step toward InterProScan becoming a fully
open source software development project. Future developments
to the InterProScan software will be driven by the demands of
the InterPro database and its users.

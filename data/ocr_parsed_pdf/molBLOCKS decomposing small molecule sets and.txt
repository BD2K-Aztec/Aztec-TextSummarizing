ABSTRACT

Summary: The chemical structures of biomolecules, whether naturally
occurring or synthetic, are composed of functionally important building
blocks. Given a set of small molecules—for example, those known to
bind a particular protein—computationally decomposing them into
chemically meaningful fragments can help elucidate their functional
properties, and may be useful for designing novel compounds with
similar properties. Here we introduce molBLOCKS, a suite of programs
for breaking down sets of small molecules into fragments according to
a predefined set of chemical rules, clustering the resulting fragments,
and uncovering statistically enriched fragments. Among other applica-
tions, our software should be a great aid in large-scale chemical ana-
lysis of ligands binding speciﬁc targets of interest.

1 INTRODUCTION

Endogenous small molecules are synthesized in the cell in a
modular fashion, using building blocks or fragments that
are often conserved across organisms (Muto et al., 2007).
Fragment-based drug discovery has also emerged as an import-
ant paradigm to navigate the diversity of the chemical landscape
and to proﬁle protein druggability (Hajduk and Greer, 2007).
Further, it has been shown that the toxicity of certain drugs
can be explained by the presence in their structure of fragments
that are shared by toxic compounds (Ahmed et al., 2011).
Although many programs are available to assemble small mol-
ecules from fragments (Schneider and Baringhaus, 2013), the
reverse problem of breaking down small molecules and analyzing
the corresponding fragment sets has been studied less extensively.
An implementation of the RECAP algorithm (Lewell et al.,
1998) to fragment small molecules can be found in a commercial
program (f ragmenter, www.chemaxon.com), and is available
in the RDKit library (http://www.rdkit.org), which also imple-
ments the BRICS fragmentation algorithm (Degen et al., 2008).
However, given a diverse set of small molecules that share a

property of interest, there is no automated tool to identify stat-
istically enriched fragments that might explain their activity.

Here we introduce the molBLOCKS suite, which allows users
to break down small molecules into chemically meaningful frag-
ments and analyze the resulting fragment distribution (Fig. 1).
The software consists of two command-line programs: frag—
ment and analyze. The fragment program reads user-
deﬁned rules to specify the bonds to break or uses default sets
of rules [RECAP (Lewell et al., 1998), CCQ [www.chemaxon.
com], and BRICS (Degen et al., 2008)]. Then, the program
applies these rules to fragment the molecules, and generates all
fragments with a number of heavy atoms above a minimum size
deﬁned by the user.

The analyze program collects statistics on the frequency
with which each fragment occurs, clusters fragments using a
user-deﬁned similarity threshold based on a fingerprint represen-
tation (O’Boyle et al., 2011) of the fragments and selects a
representative fragment for each cluster. This program can also
perform enrichment analysis at the level of either fragments or
clusters.

A typical scenario where fragment and enrichment analyses
can be applied is when dealing with a library of small molecules,
a subset of which has a speciﬁc property of interest. In these
cases, molBLOCKS can be used to fragment the whole library
and determine which (if any) fragments are significantly enriched
in the set with the property of interest. Fragmentation and
enrichment analysis of small molecules may also be useful in
analyzing proteins. For example, ligands bound by proteins
that share a common property, such as a speciﬁc function, can
be analyzed in this manner. Such an approach would provide a
complement to the functional enrichment analyses that are rou-
tinely performed with Gene Ontology terms (Huang da et al.,
2009).

Extensive fragmentation of the entire DrugBank (Wishart
et al., 2006) collection of 6460 small molecules with the default
rules took 53 s on an iMac with a 2.66 GHz processor. A user’s
guide with implementation details and more tests is provided
with the suite.

2 METHODS

2.1 fragment

Small molecules and bond-breaking rules are speciﬁed with SMILES
(Weininger, 1988) and SMARTS (Daylight Inc.) notation, respectively.
The open-source Open Babel C API (O’Boyle et al., 2011) is used to

Fig. 1. The fragment program takes as input a set of small molecules
and user-deﬁned rules that specify the bonds to break, and then applies
these rules to fragment the molecules. As an optional second step, carried
out by the analyze program, the user can cluster the fragments and/or
determine whether the frequency of any of the fragments is enriched as
compared with a background set of fragments

 

 

 

 

 

 

process the SMILES and SMARTS notation. To ensure that all possible
fragments of a minimum given size are generated (extensive fragmenta-
tion, which can be turned on with the —e ﬂag), the program uses the
following strategy. Cleavable bonds are represented as nodes in an un-
directed graph, with an edge between two nodes if both bonds can be cut;
we note that not all bonds that match the rules can be cleaved at the same
time, because doing so would yield fragments smaller than the minimum
size. Subsequently, the BroneKerbosch algorithm (Bron and Kerbosch,
1973) is used to identify all maximal cliques (i.e. all sets of bonds that can
be cleaved simultaneously). Finally, all possible fragments are generated
by cutting the bonds within each maximal clique, one clique at a time.
Without extensive fragmentation, the program returns only one possible
set of fragments.

2.2 analyze

2.2.] Fragment frequency The program returns a frequency distri-
bution with the total number of molecules that contain a given fragment.
Multiple instances of the same fragment in a molecule are counted only
once.

2.2.2 Fragment clustering Fragments are ﬁrst converted to the
Open Babel (O’Boyle et al., 2011) default FP2 fingerprint representa-
tion, which is based on linear segments of up to seven atoms in
length. The Tanimoto coefﬁcient between the ﬁngerprint representa-
tions of two fragments is used to compute their fragment similarity.
For a given threshold of similarity, a graph is created where there is a
node for each fragment, and an edge between two nodes whose cor-
responding fragments are considered similar. Subsequently, the ana—
lyze program extracts the connected components of the graph, and
selects a representative element for each cluster as the fragment with
the highest average similarity to all the other fragments in the cluster.

2.2.3 Enrichment analysis Enrichment analysis can be carried out to
identify whether speciﬁc fragments (or clusters of fragments) appear in a
set of molecules more frequently than expected by chance, as compared
with a background set of fragments. The hypergeometric distribution was
chosen to model the probability of obtaining a number of fragments (or

Fig. 2. Antineoplastic (i.e. tumor inhibitor) drugs were fragmented and
analyzed with molBLOCKS. Four clusters of fragments were found to
be enriched in this set of 16S drugs. The representative fragment for
the ﬁrst cluster is shown in the left panel, and drugs that contain a frag-
ment in this cluster are shown in the right panel. These compounds are
alkylating agents, which damage DNA by attaching an alkyl group to
the guanine base. The enriched fragment comes from nitrosurea, the mol-
ecule from which these compounds derive. Molecules are visualized
with Marvin Sketch (http://www.chemaxon.com/products/marvin/
marvinsketch/). The remaining enriched clusters are given in the

clusters of fragments) equal to or greater than the observed by chance
alone, in analogy to what is routinely done in Gene Ontology enrichment
analyses (Rivals et al., 2007). The analyze program returns both un-
corrected P-values and FDRs obtained with the BenjaminieHochberg
procedure (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) to handle multiple hypothesis
testing.

3 USAGE

As an example of how to use the molBLOCKS suite, we frag-
mented a set of antineoplastic drugs extracted from KEGG
(Kanehisa et al., 2012) with the following command:

fragment —i antineoplastic. smi —r RECAP. txt
—n 4 —o antineoplastic. frag —e

where antineoplas tic . smi is a text file containing the small
molecules in SMILES format to fragment. The RECAP . txt file
contains a definition of the cleavable bonds, encoded as
SMARTS patterns. The —e flag speciﬁes extensive fragmenta-
tion, and the —n parameter controls the minimum size of a
fragment, defined as the total number of heavy atoms. The
antineoplastic.frag ﬁle contains the output of the
fragmentation.

Subsequently, we identiﬁed the enriched fragments in a
background dataset of drugs in KEGG with the analyze
program:

analyze —i antineoplastic . frag —c O . 8
—e background. frag —o distr. txt

With the optional —c parameter, analyze clusters the
fragments at the specified Tanimoto coefficient. The optional
—e parameter speciﬁes the background set for enrichment
analysis; this set must contain the fragments in the input set
for the results to be meaningful. Figure 2 shows an example
of an enriched fragment and its parent molecules in the anti-
neoplastic set. See the Supplementary Materials for further
details.

Abstract

Motivation: Exome sequencing studies have facilitated the detection of causal genetic variants in
yet—unsolved Mendelian diseases. However, the identification of disease causal genes among a list
of candidates in an exome sequencing study is still not fully settled, and it is often difficult to priori—
tize candidate genes for follow—up studies. The inheritance mode provides crucial information for
understanding Mendelian diseases, but none of the existing gene prioritization tools fully utilize
this information.

Results: We examined the characteristics of Mendelian disease genes under different inheritance
modes. The results suggest that Mendelian disease genes with autosomal dominant (AD) inherit—
ance mode are more haploinsufficiency and de novo mutation sensitive, whereas those autosomal
recessive (AR) genes have significantly more non—synonymous variants and regulatory transcript
isoforms. In addition, the X—Iinked (XL) Mendelian disease genes have fewer non—synonymous and
synonymous variants. As a result, we derived a new scoring system for prioritizing candidate
genes for Mendelian diseases according to the inheritance mode. Our scoring system assigned to
each annotated protein—coding gene (N: 18 859) three pathogenic scores according to the inherit—
ance mode (AD, AR and XL). This inheritance mode—specific framework achieved higher accuracy
(area under curve 2 0.84) in XL mode.

Conclusion: The inheritance—mode specific pathogenicity prioritization (ISPP) outperformed other
well—known methods including Haploinsufficiency, Recessive, Network centrality, Genic
Intolerance, Gene Damage Index and Gene Constraint scores. This systematic study suggests that
genes manifesting disease inheritance modes tend to have unique characteristics.

1 Introduction

Whole—exome sequencing has been widely used for the identification
of disease—associated genetic variants. For severe and rare
Mendelian diseases, it has been proven to be an effective approach
(Agha et al., 2014). Exome sequencing may also contribute to the
understanding of the etiology of complex diseases, e.g.
Schizophrenia (Purcell et al., 2014) and Type 2 Diabetes
(Lohmueller et al., 2013). However, the functional annotation of
the protein—coding genes is still far from complete. By November
2014, 19 007 protein—coding genes had been registered in the
HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee database (Gray et al.,
2013), which includes most of the relevant DNA regions responsible
for severe Mendelian diseases and some complex diseases. On the
other hand, the data from the 1000 Genomes Project indicate that
an apparently healthy person could carry approximately 250—300
loss—of—function (LoF) single—nucleotide variants (SNVs) on average
(1000 Genomes Project Consortium et al., 2010; The 1000
Genomes Project Consortium, 2012). Therefore, the accurate esti—
mation of both gene and variant pathogenicity and corresponding
etiologic architecture pose a considerable challenge to human gen—
etic community.

A number of bioinformatics tools based on predicted deleterious—
ness and distinct biological features have been developed to priori—
tize protein—changing (i.e. non—synonymous) variants in the human
protein—coding genes. The tools FATHMM (Shihab et al., 2013),
GERP (Cooper et al., 2005), LRT (Sung and Fay, 2009),
MutationAssessor (Reva, et al., 2011), SIFT (Ng and Henikoff,
2003), SiPhy (Garber et al., 2009) and PROVEAN (Choi et al.,
2012) mainly consider sequence similarities and conservation pat—
terns across various species, whereas CADD (Kircher et al., 2014),
MutationTaster (Jana Marie et al., 2014) and Polyphen—2 (Ivan
et al., 2010) consider the functional information of the genetic vari—
ations from multiple different information sources in their algo—
rithms. Moreover, the mutation significance cutoff uses gene—level
dynamic thresholds generated by CADD, PolyPhen—2 or SIFT to re—
duce false—negative rate (Yuval et al., 2016). These tools are particu—
larly useful in clinical sequencing studies of Mendelian diseases as to
exclude a large number of neutral variants. However, inconsisten—
cies in prediction results among all these different variant—based pre—
diction tools have been demonstrated (Li et al., 2012) and results
from variant—based functional prediction are hard to be generalized
into the gene level.

A few gene scoring systems have been proposed to estimate the
effect of genetic variations at the gene level. First,
Haploinsufficiency (HI) score (Huang et al., 2010) combines a list of
biological properties by inspecting the copy number variations
(CNV) among thousands of healthy individuals. In this system,
genes with a higher HI score may imply their potential of causing
dominant traits. Second, Recessive (REC) score (MacArthur et al.,
2012) uses 213 known LoF tolerant genes and 858 known recessive
disease genes to build up a linear discriminant model to estimate the
probability that a gene can cause a recessive disease. Third, genic
intolerance (RVIS) score (Petrovski et al., 2013) assesses functional
genetic variation tolerance ability from profiles of SNVs with allele
frequency information. Fourth, network indispensability (NET)
score (Khurana et al., 2013) calculates the gene centrality and indis—
pensability in various protein—protein interactions and regulatory
networks to dissect the gene importance. Fifth, gene constraint
(CONS) score (Samocha et al., 2014) compares the genomic back—
ground mutation profile with the observed mutation profile of a
gene for interpreting de novo mutations. Lastly, human gene

damage index (GDI) (Itan et al., 2015) also utilizes the mutation
profile in both monogenic disease patients and the general popula—
tion to prioritize exome variants. However, each of these popular
gene scoring systems can only explain part of the genetic architec—
ture from different perspectives. For example, (i) HI estimation does
not include the profiles of non—CNV genetic variants; (ii) the REC
score does not consider the dominant disease—predisposing genes;
(iii) the RVIS score does not deal with variations of allele frequencies
in different populations; (iv) the systematic comparison for different
known disease—associated genes is missing in NET score study and
the sample size of LoF—tolerant and essential genes are moderated;
(v) the CONS score is only applicable for the interpretation of de
novo mutations and (vi) the GDI score only considers mutation pro—
files. Therefore, more sophisticated analysis and comprehensive pri—
oritization schemes on genes causing human disease are needed.

One of the most important characteristics of a Mendelian disease
is that its mode of inheritance can be inferred from the pedigree.
However, only a few studies have partially examined the unique bio—
logical features of genes causing the different inheritance modes of
Mendelian diseases (Huang et al., 2010; MacArthur et al., 2012).
Therefore, we developed a new gene—level scoring system,
Inheritance mode Specific Pathogenicity Prioritization (ISPP) for the
prediction of inheritance—specific pathogenicity. In addition to the
consideration of the different inheritance modes, ISPP also combines
six existing gene—level prioritization systems with many gene fea—
tures. The performance of the proposed approach was evaluated sys—
tematically by multiple curated disease—associated gene sets.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Collection of gene features and benchmark datasets
2.1.1 Variant level, gene level and functional-related gene features
Population variant profiles in protein—coding genes were obtained
from the dataset of NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project
(ESP65 00), which includes data from more than 200 000 individuals
from over 20 clinical sequencing studies. We extracted the variant
profiles of all protein—coding genes by using KGGSeq (Li et al.,
2012) and counted the number of non—synonymous (N0nsyn_v) and
synonymous (Syn_v) variants in each gene with approved gene sym—
bol from the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee. Moreover, we
retrieved 18 biological gene features from the Ensembl database
(Flicek et al., 2014) through the BioMart system. These features in—
clude gene length (Length), GC content (GC), total number of RNA
isoforms (ALL_tr_count), mean length of all RNA isoforms
(ALL_tr_length), mean length of the protein coding RNA isoforms
(CO_tr_length), number of protein coding (CO_tr_count) and non—
coding (NC_tr_c0unt) RNA isoforms (Kasprzyk, 2011). In addition,
we also gathered functional—related gene features (Lawrence et al.,
2013), including (i) global expression (Expr) derived from RNA—Seq
data and summed across the tens different cell lines, (ii) DNA repli—
cation time (Reptime), (iii) the Hi—C statistic (HIc), a measurement
of chromatin statuses as well as (iv) the noncoding mutation rate
(NC_mut_rate), which measured the mutation rate of intronic re—
gions. Moreover, published gene prioritization scores, HI (Huang
et al., 2010), REC (MacArthur et al., 2012), RVIS (Petrovski et al.,
2013), NET (Khurana et al., 2013), CONS (Samocha et al., 2014)
and GDI (Itan et al., 2015) were downloaded from either deSFP
(Liu et al., 2013) or their corresponding studies. Tissue—specific ex—
pression information (Tissuespe) was obtained from Liu et.al (Liu
et al., 2008). See Supplementary Table S1 for details.

2.1.2 Benchmark disease-associated gene sets

Based on the OMIM database (URL:http://www.0mim.0rg/Online
Mendelian Inheritance in Man), 10 lists of experts—curated disease
genes were aggregated as hOMIM gene lists (Blekhman et al.,
2008). They are hOMIM_AD [419 autosomal dominant (AD) dis—
ease genes], hOMIM_AR [569 autosomal recessive (AR) disease
genes], hOMIM_AD_AR (39 both AD and AR disease genes),
hOMIM_XL (66 X—linked disease genes), hOMIM_Birth (637 genes
for birth—onset diseases), hOMIM_Pre15 (9 genes associated with
diseases with onset age before 15), hOMIM_Pre—rep (368 genes
associated with diseases with the onset age after 15 and before 40),
hOMIM_Post40 (33 genes associated with diseases with onset age
after 40), hOMIM_Cancer (548 cancer genes from the COSMIC
database), and hOMIM_essential (hOMIM_ess) (1643 genes lethal
if knocked—out in mice). We merged hOMIM_Birth and hOMIM_
Pre15 into hOMIM_early (646 genes for diseases with the onset age
before 15 or birth) since hOMIM_Pre15 only has nine genes. In add—
ition, we collected gene lists about different disease contexts from
the RVIS study, including RVIS_HI (Haploinsufficiency, 175 genes),
RVIS_AD_Neg (Dominant negative, 364 genes), RVIS_AR
(Recessive, 818 genes), RVIS_Denovo (Denovo, 467 genes) and
RVIS_Denov0_HI (Denovo plus Haploinsufficiency, 109 genes).
Two other gene lists from the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI)
database (Blake et al., 2014), MGI_Lethality (92 genes) and MGI_
Seizure (95 genes) genes, were also selected. Furthermore, we
constructed a non—essential gene list from deSFP dataset. The non—
essential gene (Non_ess) must have at least one non—synonymous
variant: (i) with a minor allele frequency q>3.3% (816 genes),
assuming that the frequency of homozygous recessive in the popula—
tion is> 0.1%; as well as (ii) predicted to be as deleterious by at
least four aforementioned variant—based functional prediction
algorithms.

Likewise, similar but extended gene lists for diseases with differ—
ent inheritance modes and onset ages were obtained from the
Clinical Genomic Database (CGD) (Solomon et al., 2013):
CGD_AD (876 AD disease genes), CGD_AR (1500 AR disease
genes), CGD_AD_AR (304 genes with both AD and AR inheritance
modes), CGD_XL (182 X—linked Mendelian disease genes),
CGD_Adult (69 genes) and CGD_Paediatric (1401 genes). We also
collected the genes for both complex and Mendelian disorders char—
acterized by Jin et al. (2012). MC (Mendelian and Complex dis—
eases, 525 genes), MNC (Mendelian but Not Complex diseases, 445
genes) as well as CNM (Complex but Not Mendelian diseases, 25 94
genes). See Supplementary Table S1 for details.

2.2 Permutation test for exploring pattern—specific
model

To assess the biological and functional features of each disease—
associated gene set, we computed the mean of each feature for each
set and compared them with randomly generated gene sets. For each
disease—associated gene set, we (i) computed the observed mean (X,)
of each feature 1'; (ii) obtained the sampling distribution under null
hypothesis and the sampling mean u, and variance (7, of each feature
1' from selecting 100 000 random gene sets with the same gene num—
ber as the observed gene set; (iii) calculated a z—score for feature 1' of
the disease—associated gene set, 2,, based on the central limit the—
orem, i.e. Z,-: (X,- — u,)/ai (Fig. 2, Supplementary Table S2); and (iv)
calculated the corresponding P—value of the z score. A Bonferroni—
corrected P-value threshold of 005/520 z 9.615 X 10E—05 was used
to declare significance.

2.3 Machine learning model construction from selected
gene features

For differentiating gene sets with different inheritance modes and
age of onset, we used the random forest algorithm which was imple—
mented in Weka package (http://www.cs.waikat0.ac.nz/ml/weka/)
to construct the machine learning models with different combin—
ations of gene features. By using CGD database as the training data—
set, we constructed all possible combinations of biological features
to test the performance of the model. We compared the critical pre—
dictors when different feature subsets can achieve similar perform—
ance. The 10—fold cross—validation was used to assess the
performance of the models. The best model was defined as the one
with the largest area under curve (AUC) of Receiver
Operating Characteristics (ROC). In the ISPP_XL model, the cross
validation which were only sampled from those genes on X
chromosome.

3 Results

In this study, we first collected 30 known disease—associated gene
lists from independent studies or public databases as the benchmark
dataset for building and testing the inheritance—specific disease gene
prediction models. While various, these disease—associated gene lists
are not necessarily mutually exclusive. We included nine gene
groups of different inheritance modes and eight gene groups for dis—
ease with different ages of onset. Besides, we collected 14 gene fea—
tures as well as six widely used gene prioritization scores as
predictors in our prediction models (see Section 2 for details). The
data collection and analysis framework are summarized in
Supplementary Table S1 and Fig. 1.

3.1 Existing gene prioritization scores unsatisfactory
distinguish among the disease—associated gene lists

We first compared the performance of six popular gene—based pri—
oritization methods (HI, REC, RVIS, NET, CONS and GDI) which
assess gene pathogenicity using different perspectives across the 26
disease—associated gene lists. Spearman correlation analysis suggests
that these six methods only have modest correlation with each other
(r < 0.46) except for the correlation between HI and REC (r : 0.77).
(Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2, Table S1 and Text S1).

We found that the REC score had the best performance in pre—
dicting disease—predisposing genes among all six gene prioritization
scores examined (Fig. 2). However, the REC scores were insensitive
to inheritance modes even though the program was designed to
carry out the recessive disease causation probability. For instance,
both hOMIM_AD (Z score : 23.9) and hOMIM_AR

(Z score : 21.8) had significantly high REC scores compared to the
random gene sets in permutation test; also, hOMIM_AD even had a
marginally higher REC score (recessive disease causation probabil—
ity) than hOMIM_AR (Rank sum P-value : 0.061) (Supplementary
Fig. S2). Similarly, CGD_AD had significantly higher REC scores
than CGD_AR (Wilcoxon Rank—Sum P value : 1.5 54E—07).

For the HI score, the performance in classifying AR genes from
random gene sets was poor. All recessive disease—associated genes in
the lists RVIS_AR, hOMIM_AR and CGD_AR, as well as N0n_ess
genes had no difference or significantly lower HI score compared to
random gene sets (Supplementary Table S3 and Text S2). Also, in
HI scores, the AUC of CGD_AD and CGD_AR training gene sets
were only, respectively, 0.69 and 0.49 (Fig. 3). The NET scores esti—
mated the indispensability of each gene by interaction network with
moderate performance on disease—associated genes. The AUC of
NET scores can reach 0.7 and 0.62 on CGD_AD and CGD_AR,
respectively.

The purpose of the RVIS score is to estimate the tolerance of a
gene with functional variations; as a result, most of the disease—
associated gene lists had significantly lower RVIS scores than ran—
dom, especially hOMIM_AD (P :5.91E—14), hOMIM_early
(P: 1.11E—10) and RVIS_Denovo (P: 4.68E—26). However, the
RVIS scores failed to separate recessive disease—associated genes
(RVIS_AR, hOMIM_AR and CGD_AR), and the AUC only had, re—
spectively, 0.64 and 0.54 in CGD_AD and CGD_AR (Fig. 3). The
similar idea was used in GDI score to build a gene damage index
from the mutation profile of those known diagnosed monogenic dis—
ease subjects. However, the AUC of GDI score only had 0.45 and
0.58 in CGD_AD and CGD_AR, respectively.

The CONS score aims at estimating the de novo mutation effect
of a gene by using the de novo mutation rate of the genomic back—
ground as reference. A CONS score higher than that of the genomic
background suggests that the gene under consideration is sensitive
to de novo mutations, hence more prone to be pathogenic. The gene
lists hOMIM_AD and CGD_AD tend to have significantly higher
CONS scores than random (P22.62E—10 and P:4.97E—51, re—
spectively), implying that these genes are more vulnerable to de
novo mutations (Supplementary Text S2), and this is consistent with
the definition of dominant diseases. However, the AUC of CONS
score only had 0.65 and 0.43 in CGD_AD and CGD_AR, respect—
ively (Fig. 3).

3.2 Each disease—associated gene list had its own
unique pattern of biological and functional
characteristics

We observed that most disease gene lists examined consistently had
significantly more non—synonymous variants, synonymous variants
and a longer gene length than random in the permutation test
(Fig. 2, Supplementary Table S3). However, there was no clear vari—
ant profile for classifying disease genes according to just the different
inheritance modes. The only exception was the X—linked disease—
associated genes. Both hOMIM_XL and CGD_XL with average
gene length (P25.9E—02, 5.6E—04, respectively; Bonferroni—
corrected P—valuez 9.615E—05) had significantly fewer non—
synonymous variants (P22.79E—10, 1.36E—10, respectively) and
synonymous variants (P23.72E—25, 1.09E—25, respectively). We
also found that recessive disease—associated genes (hOMIM_AR,
RVIS_AR and CGD_AR) had significantly much more RNA

non—coding isoforms (P £2.70E—8). Moreover, for hOMIM, RVIS
and CGD studies, all those recessive disease—associated genes had
more non—synonymous variants than that corresponding to domin—
ant disease—associated genes (P S 5.69E—40) (Supplementary Text S3
and S4). Besides, genes in hOMIM_AR and CGD_AR had signifi—
cantly smaller CONS scores than random gene sets (P29.82E—8
and 1.24E—15, respectively), suggesting that the recessive disease—
associated genes may be less sensitive to de novo mutations.
Surprisingly, there was no statistical difference for CONS score
among CGD_Paediatric, MC and hOMIM_early, suggesting that de
novo mutations may have a benign effect on these early—onset dis—
ease—associated genes. Furthermore, CGD_AD, Genic_Denovo,
hOMIM_Cancer and hOMIM_essential had higher Z scores for HI
and CONS scores than CGD_Paediatric and hOMIM_early,

implying that dominant disease inheritance mechanisms are more
likely to be haploinsufficiency or de novo mutation sensitive.

3.3 Development of a disease inheritance mode—specific
gene prioritization system, incorporating the unique
patterns of biological and functional characteristics
Here, we have built a unified framework by using the random forest
approach to combine multiple biological features and prioritization
scores for predicting pathogenic genes with specific inheritance
modes. The training datasets included CGD_AD (876 genes),
CGD_AR (1500 genes) and CGD_XL (182 genes). Ten—fold cross—
validation was adopted to compare the performance of the predic—
tion models, which was quantified by the AUC (see Section 2). For
dominant diseases, our combined model can achieve slightly better
performance in CGD_AD (with an AUC of 0.75) compared to the
individual prediction systems. Surprisingly, the REC scores per—
formed much better than HI scores in separating dominant disease
genes from random genes with AUC of 0.73 and 0.69, respectively
(Fig. 3). For recessive diseases, our combined model had much better
performance than other prediction algorithms in CGD_AR with an
AUC of 0.73. Moreover, the performance of our model was consid—
erably superior to that of the other methods regarding the prioritiza—
tion of X—linked disease—associated genes with an AUC of 0.85 in
CGD_XL. However, the AUC of our combined model was similar
to the AUC values obtained by REC scores in hOMIM_early and
CGD_Paediatric (Supplementary Fig. S3). Finally, we have anno—
tated 18 859 protein—coding genes and provided a set of pathogenic
scores on each gene (Supplementary Table S4) for dominant, reces—
sive and X—linked (ISPP_AD, ISPP_AR and ISPP_XL scores).

3.4 Validation of the new gene prioritization system
We validated the performance of our combined prediction model by a
series of independent gene sets. Venn diagrams (Supplementary Fig.
S4A) show the degree of overlap among various training data (CGD_
AD, CGD_AR and CGD_XL) and other reported recessive disease—
associated gene lists (hOMIM_AR, REC recessive and RVIS_
Recessive). There were, respectively, 128, 107 and 206 recessive dis—
ease genes which were reported independently but not be included in
our training sets. We further compared the discrepancies of their
ISPP_AD and ISPP_AR scores by Wilcoxon rank sum test. In these
three recessive gene sub—sets, the ISPP_AR scores from the combined
model are significantly higher than the of ISPP_AD scores for all of the
non—overlapping sub—sets (P S 2.206E—5) (Supplementary Fig. S4B).
For each inheritance mode, we demonstrated the ISPP scores for
five novel disease—causal genes which recently published by inde—
pendent next—generation sequencing studies. None of these genes
were included in our positive training gene sets. As listed in Table 1,
all of the genes have the highest pathogenic prediction scores in the
corresponding inheritance modes and the scores are consistent with
the mode of inheritance initially described per each gene.
Additionally, we validated the results in one of the recent largest X—
exome sequencing study on intellectual disability disease (Hu et al.,
2015). The study reported seven novel and validated X—linked
Intellectual Disability (XLID) genes (CLCN4, CNKSRZ, FRMPD4,
KLHL15, LASIL, RLIM and USP27X) as well as two novel candi—
date XLID genes (CDK 16 and TAFI ). Seven of nine genes are on the
top 32% of the ISPP_XL prediction model in ISPP_XL score system.
TAFI is in the CGD_XL training set and has highest score on
ISPP_XL score among other inheritance modes (Supplementary
Table S4). Even though RLIM and USPZ 7X have relatively low pre—
dicted ISPP_XL score, they still have highest predicted score among

By comparing ISPP scores of each gene, the possible inheritance mode of the gene could be estimated (Supplementary Text S6). The value in parentheses indi—
cates the percentage among all in the inheritance—speciﬁc model. NIH indicates that this X—linked disease candidate gene has not been published yet but has been

other ISPP scores. This suggests that the consideration of inheritance
mode can enhance the pathogenicity prediction.

4 Conclusions

By examining a range of well—studied and independent disease—
associated gene lists, our results suggest that most of the existing
methods cannot satisfactorily distinguish gene pathogenicity and in—
heritance mode together among all the various gene lists. In this
study, we investigated the characteristics of Mendelian disease genes
with different inheritance modes. We found that AD disease—
associated genes tend to be de novo mutation sensitive and are prone
to haploinsufficiency, whereas AR disease—associated genes are
likely to have more non—synonymous variants and non—coding RNA
isoforms. Moreover, the X—linked disease—associated genes have sig—
nificantly fewer non—synonymous and synonymous variants. This
framework is splendid to combine RNA level information with cur—
rent gene prioritization methods for predicting pathogenic protein
coding gene under different inheritance modes.

The correlation analysis indicated that the overall expression level,
Hi—C status and GC content had a positive correlation with each
other (Supplementary Text S3). Moreover, almost all of the
disease—associated genes had much more RNA isoforms than ran—
domly selected gene sets (Supplementary Text S4). Even though the
information bias might be one of the confounding factors, some
disease—associated gene lists are not as significant as others such as
hOMIM_AD and CGD_XL. Additionally, the recessive disease—
associated genes, in particular, had more complicated regulatory proc—
esses and genetic variant tolerant ability, and the early—onset

disease—associated genes may have de novo mutations with merely
neutral effect. Apart from GDI scores, none of the gene prioritization
scores examined had a strong correlation with the gene features we
investigated (Supplementary Texts S1 and S3). This suggests that the
gene features we included have no predominant effect on the com—
bined machine learning prediction model. Interestingly, we found that
the REC score can well predict all of the disease—associated gene lists
with significantly higher recessive disease causation probability (REC,
P S 1.99E—8). However, it seemed no power for REC to discriminate
dominant and recessive disease genes.

Figure 2 shows the dendrogram of cluster analysis based on the
empirical Z scores for comparing gene feature patterns among 26
disease—associated gene lists (Supplementary Text S5). All recessive
disease—associated gene lists from three independent studies were
clustered together, but there are only 165 overlapping genes in these
gene lists. All of these three lists had no difference or significantly
lower CONS, RVIS and HI scores (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table
S3). On the other hand, based on the cluster analysis, dominant
disease—associated gene lists (including CGD_AD, RVIS_Denovo,
hOMIM_Cancer and hOMIM_essential gene sets) had significantly
higher Z scores for various transcriptional features, and HI and
CONS scores. Besides, it is also fair and complementary to use other
prediction methods genome—wide regardless the mode of inherit—
ance. Each prediction has its own proposed usage which might not
be fully illustrated by ISPP scores only. In conclusion, our inherit—
ance mode—specific prediction model was able to assess the potential
pathogenicity of a gene accurately. It also reﬂects the various biolo—
gical characteristics behind genes for diseases with different inherit—
ance modes. These information could provide valuable information
for gene annotation.

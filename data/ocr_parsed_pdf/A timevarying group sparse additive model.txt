Abstract

Motivation: Despite the widespread popularity of genome—wide association studies (GWAS) for
genetic mapping of complex traits, most existing GWAS methodologies are still limited to the use
of static phenotypes measured at a single time point. In this work, we propose a new method for
association mapping that considers dynamic phenotypes measured at a sequence of time points.
Our approach relies on the use of Time—Varying Group Sparse Additive Models (TV—GroupSpAM)
for high—dimensional, functional regression.

Results: This new model detects a sparse set of genomic loci that are associated with trait dy—
namics, and demonstrates increased statistical power over existing methods. We evaluate our
method via experiments on synthetic data and perform a proof—of—concept analysis for detecting
single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with two phenotypes used to assess asthma severity:
forced vital capacity, a sensitive measure of airway obstruction and bronchodilator response,
which measures lung response to bronchodilator drugs.

The goal of genome—wide association studies (GWAS) is to analyze
a large set of genetic markers that span the entire genome in order
to identify loci that are associated with a phenotype of interest.
Over the past decade, GWAS has been used to successfully identify
genetic variants that are associated with numerous diseases and
complex traits, ranging from breast cancer to blood pressure
(Hindorff et (11., 2015). However, a significant challenge in per—
forming GWAS is that the studies are often vastly under—powered
due to the high dimensionality of the feature set relative to the
small number of human samples available.

ently for association with the phenotype, and use a stringent signifi—
cance threshold to adjust for multiple hypothesis testing (Clarke
et (11., 2011). Although this approach works well for traits that de—
pend on strong effects from a few loci, it is less suitable for complex,
polygenic traits that are inﬂuenced by weak effects from many dif—
ferent genetic variants. More recently, a significant body of work
has emerged on penalized regression approaches for GWAS that
capture the joint effects of all markers (Li et (11., 2011; Wu et (11.,
2009). The majority of these methods model the phenotype as a
weighted sum of the genotype values at each locus, and use a

regularization penalty such as the £1 norm to identify a sparse set of
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are predictive of the
trait. Although this technique helps to reduce overfitting and detect
fewer spurious SNP—trait associations, the lack of statistical power
to identify true associations persists.

Here we aim to further boost the statistical power of GWAS by
proposing a new model that leverages dynamic trait data, in which a
particular trait is measured in each individual repeatedly over time,
as depicted in Figure 13. Such datasets are often generated by longi—
tudinal studies that follow participants over the course of months,
years, or even decades. Though broadly available, dynamic trait
datasets are frequently underutilized by practitioners who ignore the
temporal information. We believe that leveraging time—sequential
trait measurements in GWAS can lead to greater statistical power
for association mapping.

To illustrate this concept, consider the hypothetical patterns of
SNP inﬂuence on the phenotype shown in Figure 1b. As in traditional
GWAS, an association between a SNP and the phenotype exists if the
three SNP genotypes (which we denote AA, Aa and ad) have differen—
tial effects on the trait. In the first example, the effects of the three
SNP genotypes only differ in the t 6 [05,1] time interval. A static
method that uses data from an arbitrarily chosen time point or simply
treats the time series as i.i.d. samples could easily miss this associ—
ation, whereas a dynamic method that considers the entire dataset
would detect it. The second example shows a SNP in which the differ—
ence between the effects of the three genotypes is small but consistent
over time. Although this signal could be too weak to be interpreted as
a significant association in the static case, it gets much stronger once
evidence from the entire time series is considered.

The longitudinal data setting is challenging because traits are
measured at irregularly spaced time points over subject—specific
intervals. One approach that has been proposed for performing
GWAS of dynamic traits, called functional GWAS, or fGWAS (Das
et (11., 2011), constructs a separate model to estimate the smooth,
time—varying inﬂuence of each SNP on the phenotype. Once the
mean effects have been estimated for each genotype at each time
point, a hypothesis test is performed to determine whether the SNP
has any additive or dominant effect on the trait. Although the use of
dynamic trait data gives fGWAS more statistical power than a stand—
ard hypothesis test on static data, the principal drawback of this
method is that it is inappropriate for modeling complex traits that
arise from interactions between genetic effects at different loci. A
related approach extends the fGWAS framework to model multiple
SNPs at once using a Bayesian group lasso framework (Li et (11.,
2015). Although this approach seems promising, it is severely

limited by its very slow MCMC inference procedure. There are a
number of other methods that have been developed for dynamic
trait GWAS, including Yang et al. (2009), Furlotte et al. (2012), Das
et al. (2013), and Li and Sillanpaa (2013). However, the majority of
them either perform single—locus analysis (as in fGWAS) or fail to
learn an explicit, interpretable representation of the dynamic effects
of the genetic variants at each locus. The notable exception to this is
fGWAS with Bayesian group lasso, which we directly compare to
our approach in a later section.

In this work, we introduce a new penalized multivariate regres—
sion approach for GWAS of dynamic quantitative traits, in which
the phenotype is modeled as a sum of nonparametric, time—varying
SNP effects. We call this Time—Varying Group Sparse Additive
Models, or TV—GroupSpAM. Our method is based on GroupSpAM
(Yin et (11., 2012), a non—parametric regression model with a group—
structured penalty over the input features, which we extend to cap—
ture the dynamic effects of SNPs. This model has three major advan—
tages over existing approaches: (i) we leverage dynamic trait data;
(ii) we model the contribution of each SNP to the phenotype as a
smooth function of time, and explicitly learn these influence pat—
terns; (iii) we model the combined effects of multiple SNPs on the
phenotype and select a sparse subset that participate in the model,
thereby identifying meaningful SNP—trait associations. We show
that TV—GroupSpAM exhibits desirable empirical advantages over
baseline methods on both simulated and real datasets.

2 Approach

In this section, we first introduce a time—varying additive model for
dynamic complex traits that captures the underlying patterns of gen—
etic effects. We then apply a group sparse regularization scheme to
this model in order to impose bias useful for discovering a sparse
set of markers that inﬂuence the phenotype in a longitudinal
setting. Finally, we provide an efficient algorithm for parameter esti—
mation, and thereby association mapping, under our model.
Notation. Let X; 6 {0,1,2} : i: 1,...,n;/': 1,...,p denote
the genotype of individual i at SNP locus /, where n and p denote the
number of individuals and SNPs, respectively. Let YiT E R : i : 1, . . .
,n ; r : 1, . . . ,m denote the phenotype value of individual i at the 17th
time point. Note that the exact time readings for different individuals
at their 17th time point may be different, i.e. the measurements are not
necessarily time—aligned. We therefore introduce an explicit time vari—
able TiT E IR+ to capture the time reading for individual i at the 17th
time point, and define Y,, E Y(T,-T) as a stochastic process that cap—
tures the trait values at each time point. In what follows, we will use

2.1 Time—varying additive model
We consider the following time—varying additive model with scalar

input variables X1, . . . ,Xp and functional response variable Y(T):
p
nnzmn+ZMIpwwm (n
[:1

Here Y(T), which represents the trait value at time T, is decom—
posed into three terms: fo(T) is an intercept term that represents the
non—genetic inﬂuence on the phenotype at time T; fi(T,X,-) repre—
sents the genetic effect of marker / with genotype X,- at time T; co(T)
is the noise term that models the random ﬂuctuation of the underly—
ing process.

Since X,- is a categorical variable, each bivariate component func—
tion  can be represented more simply as a set of three univariate
functions of time, given by  : {fl-0f]-1 ,  We can subsequently de—
fine fi(T,X,-) : Zgﬁg(T) II{X,- : g} where fIg(-) : f,(-,X,- : g). Next
we simplify our notation by expanding each X,- into a set of three
binary indicator variables such that X? : 1 <:> X,- : g. This allows
us to rewrite the model in the following form.

Note that the indicator variable X? selects a single function

In the data setting, since each observation is subject to measure—
ment error, we assume Yi, : Y,(T,-,) + 5,, where 611; NM (0, 02). It
follows from the model defined in (2) that the observed phenotypic
values satisfy

j:1 g:0
for subjects 1': 1,. . . ,n and measurements 17 : 1, . . . ,m. In the

remainder of this article, we assume that the residual errors
(3,, : co(ti1)+ 6,, are i.i.d. across both subjects and measurements,
though an alternative approach would be to impose an autocorrel—
ation structure on w(T) to capture the temporal pattern of the
underlying longitudinal process (Das et (11., 2011; Li and Sillanpaa,
2013).

In the model specified above, our only assumption about the gen—
etic effects {ﬂ°,ﬂ1,fi2 : j : 1, . . . ,p} is that they are smooth functions
of time. A well—established approach to estimate nonparametric
functions in additive models (Hastie and Tibshirani, 1990) is to min—
imize the expected squared error loss:

Mﬂ=E

 

where the expectation is calculated with respect to the distributions
over SNP genotypes (X1, . . . ,Xp), time T, and phenotypic value Y.
In the sample setting, this translates to minimizing

subject to a set of smoothness constraints. We go into detail about
how to estimate the parameters of this model in Section 2.3.

2.2 Group sparse regularization
In a typical genome—wide association study, though a large number
of markers are assayed, it is believed that only a small subset of
them have a real effect on the trait of interest. This assumption m0—
tivates us to impose sparsity at the level of the SNPs X1, . . . ,Xp in
the time—varying additive model of (2), such that the effects of many
of these variables are zero. To achieve this, we apply a group—
sparsity—inducing penalty that leads to shrinkage on the estimated ef—
fect of each locus as a whole, including the component functions for
all genotypes and their values at all time points. Specifically, we em—
ploy a group norm penalty over the component functions in which
each group consists of the three functions {ﬂ°,ﬂ1,ﬁ-2} that corres—
pond to a particular marker Xi.

To construct this group penalty, we use the [1,2 norm first intro—
duced in the context of the group lasso (Yuan and Lin, 2006). The
new empirical objective function for our model is given by

A P 2
h(f)+iZ ZIIﬁ-glli
j:1 g:0

 

and is again subject to a set of smoothness constraints. Here A > 0
is a tunable regularization parameter that controls the amount
of sparsity in the model, and the squared £2 norm over fl5g is defined
as

n m

Hﬁﬁ=§3 zﬂmfe (a
i:1 1:1

The penalty term in (6) induces sparsity at the level of groups by
encouraging each set of functions {ﬂ°,ﬂ1,ﬂz} to be set exactly to
zero, which implies that the corresponding marker X,- has no effect
whatsoever on the phenotype at any time point.

In what follows, we will refer to the model defined by the object—
ive function in (6) as a Time—Varying Group Sparse Additive Model
(TV—GroupSpAM). This model is based on both the Group Sparse
Additive Model of Yin et al. (2012), in which a group sparse regu—
larization penalty is applied to a standard additive model, and the
Time—Varying Additive Model of Zhang et al. (2013), in which an
unpenalized additive model is used to regress a functional response
on scalar covariates.

2.3 Optimization algorithm

To estimate the parameters of the TV—GroupSpAM model, we use a
block coordinate descent algorithm in which we optimize the object—
ive with respect to a particular group of functions at once while all
remaining functions are kept fixed.

Before presenting a complete algorithm for the regularized
model, we first describe how to estimate the simpler, unpenalized
model introduced in Section 2.1. Given the loss function of (4),
some algebra shows that the optimal solution for fl5g satisfies the fol—
lowing conditional expectation for each genetic marker /' : 1, . . . ,p
and each genotype value g E {0, 1, 2}.

It has been well established in the statistics literature that a
scatterplot smoother matrix can be viewed as a natural estimate
of the conditional expected value (Hastie and Tibshirani, 1990).
To evaluate (8) in the sample setting, we therefore replace
the conditional expectation operator IEI - IT,X,- :g] by left

multiplication with an n—by—n smoother matrix S? : {S‘Ig[a,b]},
which is defined as

(b) :

Sﬂa,b]o<K;,()t(“)—t(b))) ifx/(fz):gandxl g

Sﬂa, b] : 0 otherwise
where (a, b) is a pair of data points, each corresponding to a particu—
lar individual i and time point r, and K1, is a smoothing kernel func—
tion with bandwidth 17. An alternative way to think about S? is as
the element—wise product of a smoother matrix for T, in which entry
(a, b) is proportional to K1,()t(“) — t0”) )), and an indicator matrix for
X,: g, in which entry (a, b) is given by II{x/(-a) : x707) : g}. This
makes intuitive sense because we want to estimate a smooth func—
tion over time for each genotype value of each SNP. Thus, to learn
each function f;g for a particular SNP / and a particular genotype g,
we only want to consider data points for which the genotype at SNP
/ is g and we want to smooth over time.

The empirical estimate of fl5g will be a vector  E Rm" whose
entries correspond to smoothed estimates of the effect of marker /
with genotype g on the phenotype at each of the observed time
points. Note that the entries of this vector corresponding to samples
with genotype 9E g for SNP / will be set to zero because the function
is not applicable to those samples. In practice, we drop these dummy
entries at the end to obtain our final function estimates. We calcu—
late these estimates using the empirical formula for (8),

where y is the vector of concatenated trait values for each sample,

a specific time point 17. Cycling though SNPs and genotypes and
applying the update rule of (9) leads to a variant of the well—known
backfitting algorithm. We refer the readers to Hastie and Tibshirani
(1990) for details about smoothing and backfitting.

Finally, in order to optimize the penalized objective given in (6),
we adapt the block coordinate descent and thresholding algorithms
from Yin et al. (2012) to our setting. The complete optimization
routine is shown in Algorithm 1. After smoothing the partial re—
sidual at each iteration, we perform a thresholding step by estimat—
ing the group norm L3,- and using it to determine whether the group
of functions f,- should be set to zero. If not, we re—estimate the func—
tion values by iteratively solving a fixed point equation. We note
that Step 9 of our algorithm runs more efficiently than the corres—
ponding step of the thresholding algorithm presented in Yin et al.
(2012) because we do not need to perform a matrix inversion on
each iteration. This property results from the fact that within a par—
ticular group of function estimates, each one covers a disjoint set of
observations, which simplifies the update equation.

3 Simulation study

In order to illustrate the utility of our method, we perform several
experiments on synthetic data. We generate data according to the
following procedure. First we construct a set of realistic genotypes
X,,- by randomly subsampling individuals and SNPs from the real
asthma dataset that we analyze in the next section. Next we inde—
pendently sample time points TiT ~ Unif(0, 1) and measurement
errors 611; N N (0, 1). We select a subset of SNPs that will have non—
zero contribution to the phenotype by placing their functions in an
active set A 2 {f1, . . . ,fp}. We then construct the active functions by
sampling their values from a diverse set of predefined influence pat—
terns that exhibit a variety of trait penetrance models (including
additive, multiplicative, dominant, and recessive) and interact differ—
ently with time (including some static patterns for balance). All
functions not in the active set, including the intercept term, are
defined such that f (t) : 0 V t. Finally, we generate phenotype values
31,-, according to the model defined in (3).

To test the robustness of our model, we generate data according
to two slightly different variants of (3). In the first setting, we up—
hold our original assumption that the residual errors are completely
uncorrelated by independently generating mi, N N(0, 02). In the se—
cond setting, we invalidate this assumption and introduce strong
correlation among the errors across time by jointly generating
(can, . . . ,coim) ~ N(0, E). In all of our experiments, we fix the num—
ber of samples at n : 100 and the number of time points at m : 10.
Then, to evaluate our approach in a broad range of settings, we
vary the total number of SNPs over 17 E {50,100,200,500,1000,
2000, 5000}, which covers both the p S n and 17> 71 cases, and vary
the size of the active set over )A) E {5, 10, 20}.

We compare our method against several baselines, including
single—marker hypothesis testing (using the Wald test), group lasso
(where each group consists of the 3 genotype indicators for one
SNP), fGWAS, and BGL—fGWAS. We used several software pack—
ages to run these methods: the PLINK toolkit (Purcell, 2009) for the
Wald test, the SLEP Matlab package (Liu et (11., 2009) for lasso and
group lasso, and the fGWAS2 R package (Wang and Li, 2012) for
fGWAS and BGL—fGWAS. To run the static data methods (hypoth—
esis test and group lasso), we summarize the phenotype values by
averaging across time.

To evaluate performance, we calculate the maximum power at—
tained by each method at a fixed false discovery rate. In order to

Fig. 2. Comparison of TV-GroupSpAM to baseline methods shows that our approach achieves greater power for a fixed false discovery rate (FDR g 0.2). The re-
sults are averaged over 20 random synthetic datasets for each setting, and the shaded region denotes the standard error

calculate this metric, we first generate a ranked list of the top IAI
SNPs identified by each method. For the Wald test and fGWAS, this
is given by the SNPs with the smallest p—values. For the penalized re—
gression methods, we test a series of values of the regularization par—
ameter, A, and select the one that yields approximately the desired
number of SNPs. We then rank these SNPs according to their fitted
model weights or norms. Given this list, we select a cutoff point that
yields the largest set of SNPs such that FDR is below 0.2, and we
calculate the power at this threshold. The results of our experiments
are shown in Figure 2.

Our results indicate that TV—GroupSpAM far outperforms all of
the baseline methods in every setting. In many cases, the three dy—
namic methods are able to detect at least twice as many true associ—
ations as the static methods. This underscores the value of
leveraging longitudinal data to boost statistical power. The results
show that TV—GroupSpAM outperforms fGWAS even when the re—
sidual errors are correlated, despite the fact that our model assumes
independent errors while fGWAS does not. These results demon—
strate that TV—GroupSpAM performs well under many different
conditions and is robust to noise.

To obtain a more complete picture of the performance of each
method, we plot the precision—recall curves obtained by varying the
number of SNPs selected by each method from 0 to p. The average
precision—recall curves obtained by averaging results over 20 data—
sets for the most challenging synthetic data setting (17 : 200,
IAI : 20, correlated errors) are shown in Figure 3. We also report
the area under the precision recall curve (AUCPR) for BGL—fGWAS
and TV—GroupSpAM. Our approach outperforms the most competi—
tive baseline by a significant margin. Lastly, we compare the run
times of the three dynamic trait methods for different values of p,
and show the results in Figure 4. For 17 : 200, TV—GroupSpAM ran
in 12 minutes, fGWAS ran in 69 minutes, and BGL—fGWAS ran in
20 hours. These results show that our method is by far the most
computationally efficient.

4 Genome-wide association study of asthma

Next we use TV—GroupSpAM to perform a genome—wide associ—
ation analysis of asthma traits. We look for associations between
SNPs and two quantitative phenotypes frequently used to assess
asthma severity: the forced vital capacity (FVC), a sensitive measure
of airway obstruction, and bronchodilator response (BDR), which
measures lung response to bronchodilator drugs. For this analysis,
we use data from the CAMP longitudinal study of childhood asthma
(Childhood Asthma Management Program Research Group et 41].,
1999) with 712552 subjects genotyped at p : 510540 SNPs from
across all 22 autosomal chromosomes. After preprocessing, in which
we removed subjects with missing data and SNPs with minor allele
frequency below 0.05, we were left with n :465 and p : 509 299.

In order to control for non—genetic effects, we incorporated several
static covariates into our model, including: sex, race, the age of
onset of asthma, the clinic where the patient’s traits were measured,
and the treatment or control group to which the patient was as—
signed in the clinical trial associated with the CAMP study.

For computational efficiency, we first used our approach to filter
out a relatively small set of SNPs to include in the final analysis for
each phenotype. To do this, we split the dataset into 100 subsets,
each containing ~5000 SNPs, and ran TV—GroupSpAM separately
on each set. We regulated the model sparsity by using a binary
search procedure to identify a value of A that selected between 90
and 110 SNPs from each subset, following the example of Wu et a1.
(2009). This yielded a filtered set of 10 118 SNPs for the FVC model
and 9621 SNPs for the BDR model. Figure 5 shows the model
weight (an indicator of significance) of every SNP that was selected
in the filtering step for each phenotype. Next we fit a new global
model for each trait using only these selected SNPs, and chose a
value of A that yielded approximately 50 SNPs with nonzero effect
on the phenotype (yielding 48 for FVC and 51 for BDR). Finally, we
refit the model on just these selected SNPs with no regularization
penalty, and use the estimated group functional norms to determine
the effect size of each SNP. The complete sets of selected SNPs iden—
tified for each trait are listed in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2.
Note that the FVC effect sizes are much higher in magnitude than

the BDR effect sizes because the FVC phenotype is measured in dif—

In order to analyze the validity of our results, we identified all
genes located within 500 Kb of each SNP and then determined
whether any of the genetic loci or nearby genes are known to be
associated with asthma or asthma—related functions in the existing
literature. Because asthma is a disease characterized by inﬂamma—
tion and constriction of the airways of the lungs, we specifically
searched for genes that have been linked to lung function or inﬂam—
matory response. Furthermore, since asthma is partly driven by a
series of interactions between vascular endothelial cells and leuko—
cytes (Bijanzadeh et 41]., 2011), we also searched for genes involved
in functions of the vascular system or the immune system, particu—
larly those in pathways involving T—helper 2 (Th2) cells, which play
a central role in the pathogenesis of asthma (Ober and Yao, 2011).

We list a curated subset of the SNPs selected in the FVC and
BDR models in Tables 1 and 2, along with the nearby genes that can
be linked to asthma. Our model was able to identify several genetic
loci that have a well—established connection to asthma. For example,
SNP rs6116189 on chromosome 20 is located near the ADAM33
gene, which has been implicated in asthma by several independent
studies (Ober and Hoffjan, 2006). In addition, SNP rs1450118 on
chromosome 3 is located near IL1RAP, a gene that produces the
Interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein and plays an important role
in asthma (Ober and Yao, 2011). Finally, the locus on chromosome
7 at 139.3 Mb is particularly interesting because it was selected in
both the FVC and BDR models. This SNP is located near the
TBXAS1 gene, which has been linked to asthma (Oh et 41]., 2011).
We plot some examples of the estimated time—varying effects of
SNPs selected in our FVC and BDR models in Figure 6.

Finally, in order to evaluate the sensitivity of TV—GroupSpAM to
noise in the data, we returned to the two filtered sets of ~10 000
SNPs each and reran the final selection step on multiple 90% sub—
samples of the data, then analyzed the stability of the set of selected
SNPs. Because the stability naturally varies with the total number of
SNPs being selected, we ran our algorithm on each subsample for a
fixed set of 2 values such that the fraction of selected SNPs ranged
from 0.5% to nearly 100%. We then calculated the average stability
for a particular value of A as the average pairwise overlap among the
selected SNPs divided by the average number of SNPs selected across
all subsamples. We plot the stability as a function of the average per—
centage of SNPs selected in Figure 7, with the shaded region show—
ing the standard deviation. These results indicate that the stability of
the FVC model when selecting 0.47% of SNPs (48 out of 10 118) is
32% and the stability of the BDR model when selecting 0.53% of
SNPs (51 out of 9621) is 39%.

5 Discussion

In this work, we propose a new approach to GWAS that bridges the
gap between existing penalized regression methods, such as the lasso
and group lasso, and dynamic trait methods, such as fGWAS. Our
approach uses penalized regression to identify a sparse set of SNPs
that jointly inﬂuence a dynamic trait. This is a challenging task for
several reasons: first, we must contend with high—dimensional data,
which necessitates that we regularize the model to perform variable
selection; second, we do not know the true underlying model by
which each SNP acts on the phenotype, and therefore we must avoid
making parametric assumptions about these patterns; third, we

assume that SNP effects vary smoothly over time, which means that
we cannot apply a standard multi—task regression model that treats
the time series as a set of unordered traits.

Although TV—GroupSpAM achieves significantly better perform—
ance on synthetic data than existing methods, there are still certain
challenging aspects of genome—wide association mapping that are
not addressed by this approach. One of these is the task of rare vari—
ant detection. Although our method is robust to detecting spurious
effects from rare variants, we are also not able to detect true effects
from rare variants with high power. This is due to the lack of data
available for the ad genotype in SNPs with very low minor allele

ABSTRACT

Summary: Unraveling transcriptional circuits controlling embryonic
stem cell maintenance and fate has great potential for improving our
understanding of normal development as well as disease. To facilitate
this, we have developed a novel web tool called ‘TRES’ that predicts
the likely upstream regulators for a given gene list. This is achieved by
integrating transcription factor (T F) binding events from 187 ChIP-
sequencing and ChIP-on-chip datasets in murine and human embry-
onic stem (ES) cells with over 1000 mammalian TF sequence motifs.
Using 114 TF perturbation gene sets, as well as 115 co-expression
clusters in ES cells, we validate the utility of this approach.

1 INTRODUCTION

Embryonic stem (ES) cells have limitless self-renewal capability
and the ability to differentiate into multiple cell types. This
makes them a good model system to enhance our understanding
of normal development and also for potential clinical applica-
tions. They facilitate in vitro studies of early developmental
events as well as differentiation into crucial cell types, such as
hematopoietic or neuronal cells (Keller, 2005). Most import-
antly, they have proven to be a highly valuable resource in re-
generative medicine, where ES cells show great potential in tissue
repair following disease or injury (Balber, 2011). These thera-
peutic applications have strengthened the push toward under-
standing how stem cells are programmed during self-renewal
and differentiation.

Transcription factors (TFs) are key players in driving cellular
programming (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006). Many TFs
have been identiﬁed with crucial roles in ES-cell biology
Woung, 2011), and their genome-wide putative targets have
been mapped using ChIP—sequencing or ChIP—on-chip technol-
ogy O§u et al., 2013). Moreover, it is also now feasible to obtain
binding sequence preferences for hundreds of mammalian TFs
(J olma et al., 2013). To use the complementary information from

both these resources to aid novel hypotheses generation, we have
developed a web tool called ‘Transcription Regulation in
Embryonic Stem Cells’, or TRES for short, to link gene sets to
likely upstream regulators in ES cells.

2 THE TRES PIPELINE

Figure 1A shows a screenshot of the web tool where users can
paste a query gene list (human or mouse) or upload it from a ﬁle.
The gene list is interrogated against four databases, and enrich-
ment is calculated using the optimized methods for each database
(see Supplementary Material for details). The output is displayed
as a ranked list of TFs generated using rank aggregation of re-
sults from four databases as well as four tables, each listing sig-
niﬁcantly associated TFs, the source database, the gene overlap
and corrected P-Values sorted from lowest to highest within each
database (Fig. 1B). The results can also be emailed to the user
when the calculation is finished. The enrichment calculation
protocols for the four databases are as follows (Supplementary
Material for full details):

(1) Based on genome-wide binding patterns for 97 murine and
49 human TFs (Martello et al., 2012; Dunham et al.,
2012), the significance of overlap between each ChIP-
sequencing dataset and the gene list is calculated using a
weighted approach, which considers the number of bind-
ing events at each gene locus (J oshi et al., 2013).

(2) Based on ChIP—on-chip data for 41 TFs 0(u et al., 2013),
enrichment for each TF is calculated by assigning weights
to genes proportional to the number of binding sites at a
given gene locus normalized by gene length.

(3) Based on 684 sequence motifs for mammalian TFs from
the JASPAR database (Bryne et al., 2008), motif enrich-
ment is calculated using all genomic regions in a gene locus
bound by at least one TF from the ChIP—sequencing com-
pendium (1) using Centrimo (Bailey and Machanick,
2012).

(4) Based on binding sites for 550 human TFs determined
using high-throughput SELEX and ChIP sequencing.
(Jolma et al., 2013), motif enrichment is calculated using
the same method as in (3).

deﬁned gene list or upload it from a ﬁle. (B) Top table of TRES output for
two cancer gene sets from MsigDB. The results show Myc and E2F family
members associated with genes upregulated in cancer (left), and Ezh2,
Suzl2 and Ringlb associated with genes methylated in cancer (right)

bladder, liver and lung. On the other hand, polycomb repressive
complex components Ezh2, Ringlb and Suzl2 (Fig. 1B, right)
were enriched in genes silenced by methylation across multiple
cancer datasets (Supplemetary Table S1).

2.1 Perturbation gene sets: case study I

To validate the TRES approach, we collected differentially ex-
pressed gene sets after deletion of 60 TFs 0(u et al., 2013) and
after overexpression of 54 TFs (Nishiyama et al., 2009). If the
perturbed TF was among the enriched TFs, it was considered a
true positive. The TRES output for all perturbation datasets is
provided on the Web site. Of the 35 TFs present in the TRES
database, 22 were correctly associated with the differentially ex-
pressed gene sets after deletion of TFs, whereas 19 of 34 TFs
were correctly associated with overexpression of TFs. The com-
bination of four different information sources thus provides a
much better coverage compared with any individual source at
similar recall and precision values (Table 1).

We performed motif enrichment by replacing ChIP-bound re-
gions with promoters [H3K4me3 peaks from Oﬁao et al., 2012)]
and promoters and enhancers [H3K4me3 or H3K4mel or
H3K27ac peaks from 0(iao et al., 2012)]. Both performed
much worse than ChIP-bound regions (data not shown). This
shows that ChIP-bound regions provide the best repertoire of
regulatory regions for motif enrichment analysis.

2.2 Co-expression clusters: case study 11

To investigate gene networks operating in ES cells, the
FunGenES consortium analyzed the transcriptome of mouse
ES cells in 67 experimental conditions and created 115
co-expression clusters (Schulz et al., 2009). Of the 115 clusters,

75 were associated with one or more TFs as their putative regu-
lators (results available on the Web site). Spl was associated with
Cluster 10 overrepresented for ‘immune response’ function using
motif information. Cluster 30, containing genes involved in the
formation of the three embryonic germ layers during gastrula-
tion, as well as Cluster 15 involved in early mesoderm develop-
ment, are preferentially bound by Ezh2 and Suzl2 transcription
repressors in ES cells. Cluster 4, which consists mostly of genes
associated with neuronal development and differentiation, is
preferentially bound by Tfap2a.

3 CONCLUSION

As next-generation sequencing technology evolves, more and
more information is being generated about genome-wide TF tar-
gets and motifs. These resources, however, still remain under-
explored for hypothesis generation. We have combined
predictions from four databases, using the most suited method
for each data type, to associate likely upstream regulators. The
TRES web tool can help to unravel potential regulatory mech-
anisms underlying cancer gene sets, thus enabling investigations
into the mechanisms responsible for the expression of gene sets
with diagnostic or prognostic relevance. A web-based implemen-
tation of TRES allows user-friendly access for the wider research
community, and thus provides a substantial new addition to the
bioinformatic toolbox for stem cell gene set analysis.

Fig. 1. CRISPR—GA pipeline. (A) From experiment to report. Schematic
pipeline of gene editing assessment. (B) Output of CRISPR—GA: different
information is estimated. Deletions, insertions, HR and corresponding
efficiencies. Upper panels estimate the number of insertions and deletions
and each corresponding size. Middle panels estimate the number of in—
sertions and deletions, and their corresponding location within the gen—
omic locus of interest. The bottom panel shows the number of deletions
and HR at each corresponding locations and outputs the HR and N HEJ
efficiency. (C) Experimental results assessed by CRISPR—GA from testing
several mutants of cas9, gRNAs and a DNA template. HR and NHEJ
values are presented

CRISPR-GA will estimate the HR (normally associated with
intended edits), non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ; normally
associated with non-desired edits) and a complete report of the
location and characteristics of the indels.

Next-generation sequencing is becoming available for most
research institutions. The possibility of bar coding hundreds of
samples in a single Illumina Miseq lane makes it competitive
from a time and economic perspective. Hundred samples can
be analyzed for a bit more than $1000 with cost of $10 per
sample, in one overnight Illumina Miseq Run.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

CRISPR-GA pipeline consists of five different steps: reads qual-
ity control, mapping, indel calling, HR and NHEJ estimation
and graphical representation (Fig. 1A). Initially, the reads are
uploaded, the 3’ end is trimmed of nucleotides with a Phred
score <20 and reads shorter than 80 bp are discarded [fastx tool-
kit, (Pearson et ai., 1997)]. This filtering and trimming step elim-
inates reads with sequencing errors. Then, they are mapped to
the user-incorporated reference sequence using BLAT [(Kent,
2002)], which has a good support for indels. If the user inputs
paired-end reads, the first two steps will be done independently,
and the results intersected. Most of the users will supply paired-
end reads, as all new Illumina kits only support paired ends.
However, CRISPR-GA single end compatibility will be main-
tained to support all possible experimental setups. In the third
step, R statistical language (http://www.R-proiect.org/) is used to

process the mapped BLAT results and call the insertions and
deletions. Fourth, pattern matching is used to compute the
number of reads matching the expected sequence and other vari-
ants generated. NHEJ and HR are estimated computing the
Equations (1) and (2), respectively. Fifth, R statistical language
is used to produce a report that integrates the results (Fig. 1B). It
consists of three parts: (i) analysis of indels sizes, (ii) analysis of
indels locations within the edited genomic locus and (iii) an inte-
grated plot representing indels, NHEJ and HR. Additionally, a
FASTA file is generated with all reads containing indels, as well
as an XML text output with HR, NHEJ values and indels rela-
tive location in genomic locus.

NHEJ: 100 X (non i expected altered reads)/ (total reads) (1)

HR: 100 X (expected sequence reads) / (total reads) (2)

We provide an example of the potential of CRISPR-GA
(Fig. 1C). We made an experiment where we analyze the effi-
ciency of different variants of cas9 (nuclease and nickases), and
different guide RNAs (gRNAs) (AS2 + S3) targeting two adja-
cent sites on the AAVSl locus (Yang et ai., 2013). We have also
used a single-stranded oligonucleotide DNA template to intro-
duce specific mutations via HR. CRISPR-GA is sensitive to
detect the differences of editing efficiency with the Human
Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (hiPSC). We see that nickase
NHEJ activity is significantly lower than that of nuclease.
However, HR efficiency shows similar results. These are expected
results, as the nickase only excises one genomic strand, whereas
the nuclease both, stimulating NHEJ pathway.

3 CONCLUSIONS

CRISPR-GA is a tool that provides easy (three mouse clicks),
economic (~$10), sensitive (detection limit <0.1%) and compre-
hensive analysis of gene editing results.

where a is a scaling parameter to be chosen by the user, and the label e in the weight
refers to “exclusivity”, The intuition behind the choice of the weight is as follows:
the smaller the number of patients in which both u and v are mutated, the smaller the
weight and the more likely that u and v are mutually exclusive, The reason behind
the use of the factor a is that we can strengthen or weaken the importance of mutual
exclusivity through a: If a is large (e,g,, empirically, a value of a > 3 is deemed
large), mutual exclusivity is enforced strictly, while if a is small, (eg a < 3), the
genes in each cluster will not be highly mutually exclusive, Also, note that

lS<u)oS(v)l <1
* min<ls<ums< m r ‘

To capture the coverage property through the positive weights, observe that if two
genes increase the coverage signiﬁcantly, their positive weight should be large so that
they are encouraged to be placed in the same cluster, To determine the positive weights,
we ﬁrst form the set D : {D(u, 12)}, for all u, v E V(G), where D(u, v) :
lS(u) A S(v)l and A denotes the symmetric difference of two sets, A large value for
the symmetric difference D(u, 1;) suggests that the vertices u and 1; should be placed
in the same cluster, since they increase the coverage of the cluster,

Given the set D, we deﬁne T(J) to be the Jth percentile ofthe values in D, In all
our runs, we used the default value of J : 95, although this choice may be governed
by the user as well, The positive weights are chosen according to:

Clustering Weights Determined Based on Mutual Exclusivity, Coverage, and
Network Information (N I-ME-CO)
The comprehensive results of pan-cancer studies reported in a number of recent
papers (Leiserson etaL, 2013; Porta-Pardo 21111,, 2015; Leiserson 21111,, 2015b; Garcia-
Alonso etaL, 2014) have revealed the important connection between network topology
and cancer driver distribution patterns, More precisely, the effect of deleterious
mutations on the phenotype may be suppressed through a particular conﬁguration of
the corresponding protein complexes, and at the same time, the strength of the effect
of amutation may be emphasized through another conﬁguration, As an example, most
of the variants observed in healthy individuals seem to appear at the periphery of the
interactome, and they do not seem to inﬂuence network connectivity, In contrast,
cancer driver somatic mutations tend to occur in central, internal regions of the
interactome and within highly co-integrated components, It appears that no previous
attempts were made to more precisely quantify the network distances between driver
variants, which prompted us to perform the following analysis, We ﬁrst computed the
pairwise (shortest) network distances between genes in a large pathway comprising
8,726 genes from (Ciriello et (11,, 2012) via an implementation of the standard
Dijkstra algorithm (Skiena, 1990), In this test, we randomly selected 1,000 pairs in
order to reduce the computational burden of running Dijkstra’s algorithm 0(87262)
times, By using the most complete known driver list from the Cancer Gene Census
(CGC) (Futreal et (11,, 2004), we computed the same distances for driver genes, this
time for all pairs of genes, The resulting distribution of shortest paths is depicted in
Fig, 1, One can clearly observe that the average shortest distance between drivers is
signiﬁcantly smaller than the average shortest distance between two randomly selected
genes, A permutation test conﬁrms this observation, and we calculated ap-value of
less than 0001,

These ﬁndings suggest that when determining potential driver mutations, one
should make use of network distance and connectivity information, This may

median result for the fraction of samples covered equal to 0.5505 for C3, and 0.5662
for CoMEt, This rather poor performance of both methods is observed for all values of
k, with no p-value based on Student’s T-test (Zimmerman, 1987) being less than 0.05,
The largest difference in coverage recorded for the two methods is present for k : 6,
In conclusion, there appears to be no statistical difference between C3 and CoMEt in
terms ofBRCA coverage percentage (p-value ofO.5127), In GBM, the median p-value
for coverage difference is more pronounced, The median coverage of C3 is 0.632 and
the median coverage of CoMEt is 0.696, CoMEt ﬁnds signiﬁcantly higher-coverage
clusters according to Student’s T-test, with p-value 0.0345, and the most pronounced
coverage percentage differences exist for small values of k (0.3745 vs, 0.6495 for
k : 5 C3 and CoMEt, respectively), It is also important to note the wide distribution
of coverage score values produced by C3 for small k: the IQR (Interquartile range)
value is roughly 035 for k : 5, The most likely reason behind this result is
that our test weights were chosen to boost the relevance of mutual-exclusivity and
biological signiﬁcance rather than coverage, Mutual exclusivity accounts for 100%
of the negative weights of edges, while coverage accounts for only 167% of the
positive weights, We justify this weight choice by the fact that it leads to multiple
signiﬁcant cluster discovery and with our assumption that coverage is a less signiﬁcant
driver property compared to mutual exclusivity, We also point out that it appears that
a biologically more relevant coverage constraint is pathway coverage, rather than
patient sample coverage,

As already mentioned in the previous sections, one advantage of C3 is that the
user can adjust the weights according to her/his own belief about the signiﬁcance of
patient coverage, For example, by changing the averaging weights in our GBM run
to 1m : 0.60 (coverage), w; : 0.20 (network), and ’LU3 : 0.20 (expression), we
obtain a coverage percentage of 0.7903 for k : 5, However, this excellent coverage
comes at a cost ofa less signiﬁcantmutual exclusivity score (fractional value 0.4288)
and a lower proportion of detected drivers (fractional value 01267), As may be seen
from the above example, C3 can be adapted to the user‘s speciﬁcation to best reﬂect
the scope and preferences of the analysis,

in black represent driver candidates identiﬁed by C3 within a small subnetwork. Edges are depicted in
black if there exists a direct interaction between two genes. Green edges represent an interaction that
undergoes a protein state change. Purple edges are other interactions.

Another setting in which we analyzed C3 and CoMEt involves pairwise distances
of drivers in the network (see Fig, 3D), Here, we calculated the average pairwise
distance between all pairs of genes clustered together, We then used Student’s T-test
to determine the statistical signiﬁcance of this value, We also compared the values for
both algorithms based on 1000 randomly selected genes by using apermutation test,
For BRCA, we found no signiﬁcant performance difference between the two methods
in terms of the average pairwise distance: 3110 for C3 and 3.070 for CoMEt, with

a p-value of 0.9330, In GBM, C3 showed a smaller average pairwise distance of
2.908 compared to CoMEt‘s 3.097, This difference is statistically signiﬁcant, with
a p-value of 0.0379, The small average network distance results of C3 for GBM,
coupled with the low coverage, leads to the conclusion that C3 favors niche, exclusive
clusters in biologically relevant cancer pathways, Hence, the method may be useful
for discovering speciﬁc molecular cancer subtypes, Both methods had an average
pairwise distance well below the permutation benchmark of 3.903: the p-values of
both C3 and CoMEt were less than 2 >< 10’16 for both cancers,

In conclusion, from our detailed evaluation we conclude that although C3 does not
simultaneously outperform CoMEt with respect to all four evaluation criteria, but only
three of them (which already represents a signiﬁcant advantage), the C3 performance
indicates a strong overall propensity to select biologically more relevant and more
mutually exclusive clusters, with a higher degree of ﬂexibility compared to CoMEt,

4.2 Discovering potential driver pathways

We examine next the potential of the C3 algorithm to detect clusters whose gene?
may be new candidate cancer drivers, We focus our search on clusters that contaipi
biologically signiﬁcant driver genes and known biological network interactions, ang
exhibit high mutual exclusivity and coverage, At the same time, we only consider thg‘
large cluster size regime, as results in this domain have not been previously reporteH,
in the literature and as they offermany new interesting insights, Two examples of mg
analysis are shown in Fig, 4 and Fig, 5,

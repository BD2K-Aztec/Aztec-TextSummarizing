ABSTRACT

Motivation: Several international collaborations and local projects
are producing extensive catalogues of genomic variations that are
supplementing existing collections such as the OMIM catalogue. The
flood of this type of data will keep increasing and, especially, it will be
relevant to a wider user base, including not only molecular biologists,
geneticists and bioinformaticians, but also clinical researchers.
Mapping the observed variations, sometimes only described at the
amino acid level, on a genome, identifying whether they affect a gene
and—if so—whether they also affect different isoforms of the same
gene, is a time consuming and often frustrating task.

Results: The PICMI server is an easy to use tool for quickly mapping
one or more amino acid or nucleotide variations on a genome and
its products, including alternatively spliced isoforms.

Availability: The server is available at www.biocomputing.it/picmi

1 INTRODUCTION

The availability of novel high-throughput technologies for identi-
fying variations, both pathological and physiological, in sequenced
genomes is producing a wealth of data that is readily available to
researchers.

These data will continue to be produced at an unprecedented speed
not only in projects based on large international collaborations,
but also in individual labs and will add to existing collections
such as OMIM (Amberger et al., 2009), SwissProt (The UniProt
Consortium, 2010) and the related mutation portal SwissVar (Mottaz
et al., 2010).

It can be easily foreseen not only that more and more data will
be available, but also that the scientists who will need to access and
analyze them will not be limited to molecular biologists, geneticists
and bioinformaticians, as it has been mostly the case so far, but will
include Clinical researchers and in the future also medical doctors.
This implies that tools to easily access and interpret these data should
be provided to the community and that they have to be simple,
reliable and user-friendly.

Given one or more variations of interest, one needs to map them
back to the corresponding genome, verify in which region they fall
and, if they map to a coding region, understand whether they affect,
and in which way, one or more of the isoforms of the gene. This task
is not made easier by the fact that the version of the genome might
have Changed since the time of identiﬁcation of the mutation.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Less straightforward is the analysis of an amino acid mutation
when the corresponding nucleotide variation is not reported, as is
the case for several instances in OMIM (Amberger et al., 2009) and
for those in the SwissVar collection (Mottaz et al., 2010).

At present, Ensembl (Hubbard et al., 2009) can be used to retrieve
the location of nucleotide variations, by installing the relevant APIs
and locally running a perl script. Associated web-based tools such as
the one described in MCLaren et al. (2010) can perform the mapping
of nucleotide variations, but not of amino acid variations. For the
latter, the corresponding nucleotide variations can only be retrieved,
for example using SIFT (Kumar et al., 2009), when they correspond
to a known SNP, stored for example in dbSNP (Sherry et (11., 2001).

To address this conceptually easy, but technically time consuming
and often frustrating problem, we developed the PICMI (Perhaps I
Can Map It) server.

The server can map nucleotide variations on the human, mouse,
rat and Chicken genomes (altogether accounting for more than three
quarters of the annotated variations) and on their different versions,
report in which region they map and, when they fall in a coding
region, provide information on their location on all isoforms of the
gene, if any. Notably, the user can also input one or more amino
acid variations for proteins in the UniProt database. In this case the
system maps them back to the genome and infers, whenever this can
be done unambiguously, the corresponding nucleotide variations that
are subsequently analysed as described above.

2 DESCRIPTION

The server allows the selection of the relevant species and, if more
than one genome assembly exists, of the speciﬁc version from
Ensembl. Multiple nucleotide and amino acid variations can be used
as input (Fig. 1).

Nucleotide variations are identiﬁed by their position on a
Chromosome and by the wild-type and mutated nucleotide. The
server uses the information on the wild-type nucleotide to identify
the correct strand and to verify that the selected base is indeed present
in the correct position of the selected version of the speciﬁc genome.
The VCF 1000 genome format can be selected as input as well by
Checking the appropriate box.

Unless the input position falls in an intergenic region, the tool
will map it with respect to the transcript(s) and report whether it
falls upstream, downstream, in the 5’ or 3’ untranslated region, in a
stop-codon, in a skipped exon or in a coding exon. In the last case,
the mutation is mapped on all the isoforms of the gene. The variation
is assigned to the synonymous, nonsense or missense category and,
in the latter case, the system provides the wild-type and mutated
amino acid in each of the isoforms.

a coding region.

The user can also input one or more amino acid mutations in a
given protein when the information on the corresponding nucleotide
mutation is not available, as is the case for those reported in the
SwissProt ‘Natural variant’ ﬁeld, in the SwissVar portal and in a
number of entries in OMIM. Given the UniProt identiﬁer of the
protein, the position of the mutation and the wild-type and mutated
amino acid in the protein sequence, the system will retrieve the
coordinates of the corresponding gene in the genome, identify the
wild-type codon and verify whether the mutated amino acid can be
unambiguously obtained by a single-nucleotide mutation. If this is
the case, the identiﬁed nucleotide variation is treated as in the case
of an input nucleotide variation (Fig. 2).

The system relies on the Perl APIs provided by Ensembl. For
nucleotide variations, it ﬁrst veriﬁes whether the input data are
consistent with the genome sequence and, next, it maps the identiﬁed
position on all the genes/isoforms spanning it. For amino acid
variations, after a consistency Check, it aligns the UniProt sequence
to the corresponding Ensembl gene products and proceeds as in the
case of nucleotide variations.

As an example of the usefulness of the amino acid variation option
of the tool, entry 600509.0011 of the OMIM resource reports two
mutations of the ABCCS protein associated to hyperinsulinemic
hypoglycemia, E1506K (Huopio et al., 2000) and E1507K (Pinney
et al., 2008); however, the two mutations correspond to the same
nucleotide variation, and the discrepancy in the numbering is due to
the fact that they were originally mapped by the authors on different
splicing isoforms of the protein.

The question obviously arises about how often an amino acid
variation can be unambiguously assigned to a single nucleotide
polymorphism. We tested the PICMI server on the whole collection
of polymorphisms in the SwissVar knowledgebase that provides
information on about 53 000 amino acid variations (release 56.8).
(Results are available at www.biocomputing.it/picmi/SwissVar).
Interestingly, >85% of the amino acid variations could be
unambiguously associated to single nucleotide mutations and
therefore mapped on all alternative isoforms of the corresponding
analyzed genes.

3 CONCLUSIONS

We believe that this easy-to-use tool can reveal to be very useﬁil both
to simplify the mapping of nucleotide variations and, especially, to
analyze a number of pathological and physiological variations at the
nucleotide level when they are only reported at the protein level. In
this way, the server can add value to existing amino acid variation
data. We will continuously update it by adding more genomes, as
soon as sufﬁcient mutation data will accumulate. We also plan to
allow mapping of insertions and deletions in the next release and to
make the tool available as a web service.

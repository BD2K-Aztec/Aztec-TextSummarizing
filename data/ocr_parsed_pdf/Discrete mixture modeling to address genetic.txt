model risk in gene expression. The question remains about
whether this kind of example exists in real data. We present a
gene that does just this in the following illustration.

2.2 Cytoreduction and epiregulin

We draw known class labels from a measured surgical covariate,
which is presently used as a biomarker. Cytoreduction, the
amount of tumor remaining after surgery, is a measure of success
of surgical debulking, which is a component of primary therapy
in ovarian cancer. Patients who are suboptimally cytoreduced
have a clinically signiﬁcant amount of residual tumor that will
seed future recurrent disease and progression (Bhoola and
Hoskins, 2006).

Using the TCGA study to be introduced in Section 6, we sep—
arate the patients into optimal and suboptimal categories and
provide a kernel smoothing estimate of their hazards (Fig. 2).
The estimated hazards are clearly non—proportional [P=0.007,
Grambsch and Therneau (1994)], reflecting the early protective
effect of optimal cytoreduction and its transient nature.

Fitting separate models in each subgroup, we searched for genes
whose relationship with survival inverts over classes ﬁnding epir—
egulin (interaction P = 0.004), which has been recently highlighted
as a progression marker (Amsterdam et al., 2011). In optimally
cytoreduced patients, increased expression is detrimental to sur—
vival ([9 = 0.156, P = 0.014); in suboptimal patients, increased
expression is protective ([9 = —0.452,P = 0.012). In Figure 2,
we have plotted the estimated survival for high and low epiregulin
expression for optimal and suboptimal patients. Noting that epir—
egulin has been shown to inhibit epithelial tumor cells and stimu—
late cancer—associated ﬁbroblasts (Toyoda et al., 1995), the
surgical outcomes may indicate a more epithelial or more ﬁbrous
tumor; a fair biological explanation is that epiregulin expression
leads to the inhibition of tumor burden (a better prognostic out—
come), or the stimulation of fibroblasts that leads to cancer
progression.

Thus, these effects do exist and imply surprisingly deep biolo—
gical connections. Following a genomic survey, this type of effect
is an ideal target for functional studies. Given that we want to
identify genetic subgroups with different prognoses, we should
favor a model that admits unknown and possibly dramatically

different survival experiences. The mixture model should let us
estimate labels and should be able to resolve non—PH.

3 METHODS

Let (Y,-,8,-,x,-), i=1,  ,n be an independent right-censored sample
with regression covariates x,- = (x;1,x,-2, . . . ,xip)’, where 8,- : 1 indicates
that the complete time has been observed. We will denote the collections
of survival times, censoring indicators and covariate vectors as

Y: (Y1,  , Y"), A = (81,  ,8") and x = (x1,  ,xn), respectively.
To account for heterogeneity, we propose that each patient arises from
one of K latent classes with probability I'm/r = l,  ,K, 2A, 7r). 2 1.

We assume Cox’s PH model (Cox, 1972) within each class k, so that
the covariate vector x enters the model log-linearly via a class-speciﬁc
hazard: log 11k(t|x) = log 110)“) + x’ﬂk. For a general introduction to the
Cox regression, see Hosmer et a]. (2011). In particular, recall that a right-
censored observation following a PH model has the density

ka’, SIX) = [/10k0’)exPU’ﬂUIBCXpl-HOAU’)“PW/30], (1)

where 110)“) and H0k(t) are the baseline hazard and baseline cumulative
hazard for the kth class. The mixture density may be written as

n K

If we also observe the latent class U 2 (U1, U2, . . . , U"), where
U,- ~ Multinomial(rr), U,- 6 {1,2, ...,K} and L1,). = 1(5):“, we may
write the density of the complete data as

n K
ﬂY, Alx, U) = H 1'1 [mun warm. (3)
I':1 [:1

To estimate the regression coefﬁcients and baseline hazard parameters,
we propose maximizing this likelihood via the expectation maximization
(EM) procedure (Dempster et 01., 1977) described in Section 4.

The discrete mixture leads to the model’s interpretation as organizing
observations into clusters that are not known a priori. This type of clus-
tering should not be confused with clustered survival data, which typically
refers to the case where class labels identifying multiple observations from
the same source (e.g. treatment centers or year of diagnosis) are known.
Instead, observations are gathered according to their best-ﬁtting regres-
sion model.

Additionally, our mixture relaxes the PH assumption; we only need to
assume that hazards are proportional within their given clusters. The
practical interpretation of this property is highlighted in the example
given in Section 2.2. Continuous frailty (Aalen, 1988) and random effects

Cox-assisted clustering

 

models (O’Quigley and Stare, 2002) are other common methods for
accommodating heterogeneity, but they still rely on the PH framework.

In addition to presenting a novel approach for handling heterogeneity
and subgroup discovery for time-to-event data, our approach offers a
new contribution to the ﬁnite mixture model literature (McLachlan and
Peel, 2000; Fruhwirth-Schnatter, 2006). The problem of ﬁnite mixtures
has been explored in mixed effects models (Qin and Self, 2006), general-
ized linear models (Wedel and DeSarbo, 1995) and discrete-time survival
models (Muthén and Masyn, 2005); our approach extends the idea to PH
regression.

4 ALGORITHM: COX-ASSISTED CLUSTERING

We refer to the following algorithm for maximizing the mixture
likelihood as Cox—assisted clustering (CAC). For convenience, we
write the parameters to be estimated as 7': = (n1, n2, . . . , 71K), the
mixing proportions, h = {h01(t), ...,h0K(t)}, the set of baseline
hazard functions and ﬂ 2 (Bl, ..., BK), the coefficient vectors.
We further abbreviate the hazards at their evaluation points:
hon = h0k(Yi) and H01“~ = H0k(Yi)-

The complete data likelihood with mixing parameters 7': and
class—speciﬁc parameters h and B may be separated into a mixing
distribution part and a component distribution part:

10gL(IT, h, ﬂ; Y, A, W) = 10gL1(n; U) + logL2(h,ﬂ; Y, AIU,x)-
The first is simply
K n
log L1(Tl'; U) = Z  qu)10gJTk, (4)

and the likelihood associated with the component distributions is

k=l i=1

(5)

To compute the maximum likelihood estimate, we follow an
EM approach that estimates and optimizes the observed data log
likelihood by plugging 12m = E(u,~k| Y ,~, 6,, x) into the complete
data likelihood. Supposing that the current values of the param—
eters at the mth iteration are 71):"), hgg,  and ET"), the algo—
rithm proceeds as follows.

In the E—step, conditional mean is

after the application of Bayes rule. We note that, unlike the
standard Cox regression setting, computing the baseline hazard
is necessary to compute the conditional means. It can be shown
that if we assume a common baseline hazard across clusters, the
E—step update depends only on the current estimates of 7': and B.

In the M—step, the update for mixing proportions 71k is
straightforward:

n
Earle
+1 '=l

To update h, we make a proﬁle likelihood argument that leads
to a partial likelihood (Johansen, 1983). Suppose we hold ﬂk
constant. Maximizing over hOk, we obtain proﬁle estimates of
the hazards as a function of the ﬂy“) that are similar to
Breslow (1974):

Each component indexed by k may be maximized separately
to obtain the ﬂy“) update using standard statistical software.
The M—step is operationally equivalent to ﬁtting K—weighted Cox
models. Finally, one iterates between the E and M step until the
increment in log—likelihood is small.

4.1 Starting conditions and number of classes

As an iterative procedure, the EM algorithm requires initial
values ﬂ”), 71(0). For analyses that begin with strong biological
hypotheses, the corresponding parameters may be set directly.
An alternative is to choose starting parameters by assigning ob—
servations to speciﬁc classes and estimating the initial M” and
71(0). This is equivalent to setting an initial value for every 12% and
running the algorithm forward. This assignment may be random;
one may set a randomly selected 12% to 0.8, say, and divide the
remaining weight among the other classes. In practice, we use
multiple random starts and pick the best by the ﬁtted log—
likelihood.

As in other clustering problems (Fraley and Raftery, 1998), we
select the number of classes using the Bayesian information cri—
terion (BIC). Let L(K) = L(hK, BK, 71K; Y, 6, le), where we have
added the K subscript to emphasize the dependence. The BIC
criterion is expressed as

BIC(K) = —210g L(K) +pKlog(n), (11)

where p is the dimension of X and n is the number of observed
patients. The value of K minimizing BIC(K) is a penalized com—
promise between ﬁt and complexity. Also, while Volinsky and
Raftery (2000) propose weighting by the number of observed
events, log(Zi6,~), because log(n) is always larger, the standard
BIC is a more conservative criterion.

As a measure of model sensitivity to additional clusters, we
consider an adaption of the DFBETA statistic (Hamilton, 1992).
Given a model fit for K classes, each patient 1' can be assigned a

parameter vector 6075.10) given their assigned class,  . For each
component j, we simply consider the average change over K:

5.0210) — 5.0:”)

DFBETA(j,K) = If1  (12)

 

This statistic will be large when the coefﬁcients change dra—
matically between cluster numbers. Conversely, if the (K+ 1)th
cluster simply subdivides an existing cluster, the statistic will be
small.

5 SIMULATION STUDIES

Although there are several properties of the model and algorithm
to highlight, we focus on its treatment of censored data and a
demonstration of its estimation ability. Let true class indicator
U,~ 6 {1,2} be evenly split among 211 observations with a single
covariate (X 1, . . . , X2") ~ N(u12n, 12") independent normal with
mean u 3 0 and variance 1. As is common in gene expression
studies, we will work with scaled and centered X, so It reﬂects the
sensitivity of the analysis to this standardization.

The relationship between survival and X is controlled by
B 3 0, where the ﬁrst class has 61 = ﬂ and the second class has
ﬁg 2 —ﬂ. The survival time for the ith patient is then
T ,~ 2  where e,~ ~ Exponential(1). The censoring time is

generated from Q ~ Uniform(0,)I), where )I depends on the
choice of u and ﬂ and a target censoring rate. Finally, the
observed survival time is Y ,~ 2 min(T,~, C,~).

We set n=200 patients in each class and set 6 = 3 so that
61: +3 and ﬁg 2 —3. We target 40% censoring by setting
)I = exp(0.99) for u = 0 and )I = exp(12.83) for u = 5. For
this simulation, we run our algorithm at the true number of
clusters K: 2.

We study the same scenarios over 1000 simulations. In
Table 1, we report the estimated ﬂk (choosing 61 g 62 for iden—
tifiability) alongside the oracle estimator that knows the true
classes. Intuitively, if the data are perfectly classiﬁed, the oracle
estimate will have properties consistent with the well—studied Cox
model estimate. Thus, the accuracy, the proportion of patients

assigned to their true class, is an ideal measure of loss of per—
formance due to uncertainty. Considering the standard Cox
model in this heterogeneity setting, the median parameter esti—
mate for the u = 0 case is 1.8e—05 (range —0.2&0.28) implying
that heterogeneity has masked all detectable association with the
covariate of interest.

The results imply that the clustering algorithm works well des—
pite heavy censoring and mean mis—specification. We note a bias
toward larger absolute parameter estimates (ﬂCAC‘1>ﬂo,m,m)
that we believe comes from the algorithm greedily reinforcing
what it has already learned. A censoring bias in the u = 5 scen—
ario appears as ﬂCAC‘z is smaller than it should be; this group is
more likely to be censored so it has a lower effective sample size.
Variation in per cluster censoring rates is a novel data consider—
ation, and we recommend tracking the number of events in each
cluster (see for example Section 6). When the cluster sizes are
generated by 2,. U,~ ~ Binomial (2n, 1 /2), the estimates are simi—
lar and the standard errors increase reﬂecting the variation in U,-
(Supplementary Material).

To consider the ability of CAC to identify heterogeneity, we
tested the above u = 0 scenario with the DFBETA statistic
noting that DFBETA(K=2) is greater than DFBETA(K=3)
in all cases; the median DFBETA(K=2) was 60 (IQR: 92),
implying the model was much more sensitive to two clusters
than one, whereas the median DFBETA(K: 3) was 0.91
(IQR: 0.21), implying that two clusters are sufﬁcient.
Conversely, if we generate data where all patients come from
the same class, DFBETA(K=2) is larger than
DFBETA(K: 3) in 61.2% of cases with medians 0.83 and
0.81, respectively. This implies that, along with appropriate con—
text and judgment, the DFBETA statistic is a useful tool for
diagnosing heterogeneity.

6 DNA REPAIR EXPRESSION SUBGROUPS IN
OVARIAN CANCER

Because of its frequency among gynecological cancers, its high
lethality and poor options for treatment (Vaughan et al., 2011),
serous ovarian cancer was a pilot target for molecular character—
ization in TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network,
2011). The study collected banked surgical samples from n = 503
patients with highly annotated clinical follow—up whose cancers
had been surgically debulked and who had been treated with
platinum—based chemotherapy (Bhoola and Hoskins, 2006).

Platinum resistance is an important concept in the treatment
of ovarian cancer because these cancers respond poorly to any
type of chemotherapy (Bookman, 2005). Although resistance is
not an ideal predictive marker because it is deﬁned through treat—
ment, the development of an independently queried molecular
model is precisely the promise of a large repository study like
TCGA.

One unaddressed complication is the expectation of genetic
heterogeneity: patients with similar survival outcomes may
have dissimilar molecular proﬁles. If this heterogeneity appears
to take the form of subgroups and mixtures (as in the illustra—
tions), we anticipate that our model and algorithm will be able to
address it.

Cox-assisted clustering

 

Therefore, we demonstrate the use of our model to explore
possibly heterogenous data by modeling a potential mechanism
of platinum resistance in TCGA patients. Because recent reviews
of resistance highlight the homologous repair pathway for repair—
ing DNA damage (Martin et al., 2008; Cooke and Brenton,
2011), we focus on modeling the function of this set of genes.
The homologous repair pathway is defined by Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes annotation (hsa:03440)
(Kanehisa et al., 2010) and corresponds to 27 unique gene
symbols.

We ﬁt our model for K: 2, ..., 10 using 100 random starts
for each K and selecting the best fit by log likelihood. By BIC, we
select K :5 clusters (Supplementary Material). Survival times
are truncated at 60 months of observation to reduce the inﬂuence
of 76 patients who are observed beyond the time of interest. In
total, 186 of 503 (37%) patients are censored before 60 months.

Table 2 describes the quality of the cluster ﬁts by the relative
weight of each cluster (Ziﬁik), the number of patients assigned
(11) and the mean posterior probability for patients in their as—
signed clusters. The number of events in each cluster and the
restricted mean (up to 60 months) are listed.

We observe that, although they have the largest number of
patients assigned, clusters 4 and 5 have the smallest mean pos—
terior probabilities, implying that their members are less similar
internally. The clustering appears to be driven by the poor prog—
nosis patients in clusters 1, 2 and 3. Noting the presence of cross—
ing survival functions, the five class log—rank test is significant
(P : 1.26e—09).

With respect to low posterior probabilities, we observe that the
algorithm makes intuitively reasonable use of the censored ob—
servations. We plot the maximum posterior probability for each
patient by their survival time in Figure 3A. Because censored
patients do not have definitive events, the algorithm is less cer—
tain about which cluster to assign them. Patients with the least
follow—up time have maximum posterior probability close to 0.2
(i.e. 1 of 5), and as they are observed, longer the certainty of their
maximum assigned cluster rises. To wit, the hardest to classify
patients are the least observed.

Within each cluster, we check model diagnostics and look for
inﬂuential points. Noting that there was moderate evidence
(P : 0.059) for non—PH (Grambsch and Therneau, 1994) when
considering all the patients as a single group, after fitting our
model, the within—cluster tests are all strongly insigniﬁcant. All
inﬂuence statistics for all genes in each cluster are smaller than 1
standard deviation, implying no leverage points.

Because the mixture allows different clusters to have different
baseline hazard functions, in Figure 3B, we used a kernel
smoothing algorithm to visualize their estimates (Muller and
Wang, 1994). We emphasize the non—proportionality of the haz—
ards for clusters 3 and 5: patients in cluster 3 have a sudden
acceleration in their hazard after 30 months, which may be con—
sistent with the loss of effect in platinum chemotherapy.

In Figure 3C, we have plotted the estimated coefﬁcients for
clusters 3 and 5. Keeping in mind that the linear predictor in the
Cox model scales hazard relative to the cluster—speciﬁc baseline
hazard, we highlight three genes. RPA4’s coefﬁcients
(63,65) : (+7.13, — 5.90) imply that it has a strong deleterious
effect in cluster 3 (exacerbating the jump in hazard), while it has
a strong protective effect in cluster 5. Contrast this change with

RPA3 (—0.96, + 6.24), which only increases risk in cluster 5, and
TOP3A (—7.54, — 0.54), which is protective in cluster 3 only. At
this point in the analysis, these genes are good candidates for
follow—up studies: we have identiﬁed their effect speciﬁc to a
subgroup of patients.

Further, the clustering model may still recover a sense of DE
for survival data. Because we have learned risk classes, we may
consider DE across clusters. We focus on DE across clusters 3
and 5, SHFMl (Bonferroni adjusted t—test, P:0.011), RPA3
(P:0.011) and RAD51L3 (P:0.020), all have signiﬁcant
shifts in expression. Notably, RPA4 and TOP3A do not show
signiﬁcant DE, implying that they ﬁt into the class of variables
that only differ in regression model effects.

Representative of prognostic signature development, Kang
et a]. (2012) conducted a study of selected DNA repair pathways
and produced a risk signature in this dataset. To compare with
their model (using 151 genes across eight pathways) and a typical
Cox model approach (using the 27 gene homologous repair path—
way), we stratiﬁed patients based on survival to 3.7 years [as in
Kang et a]. (2012)] and produced receiver operating characteris—
tic plots for all of the signatures (Fig. 4A). While the standard
Cox model underperforms at area under the curve (AUC) 0.61
(comparable with a clinically derived model reported by Kang
and colleagues), the K: 5 CAC model has AUC 0.73 compar—
able with Kang’s model (AUC 0.70).

The key advantage of the CAC approach is the ability to de—
scribe risk sets. By itself, the Cox model describes continuous risk
and must be dichotomized post hoc for survival curve plots of
high— and low—risk subsets. In Figure 4B, we have illustrated the
typical continuous risk score plot that describes sensitivity of
high— and low—risk sets to the cutpoint. The CAC model naturally
separates patients into risk classes (clusters 3 and 5 are high—
lighted, Fig. 4C) and these can be further described by processing
their continuous risk scores.

Based on our analysis, we conjecture that we are able to iden—
tify a subgroup of patients (cluster 3) who experience a signifi—
cant increase in hazard around month 30. We are able to identify
genes whose expression leads to increased risk speciﬁc to a sub—
group or whose relationship inverts across clusters. There is a
tremendous amount of untapped information remaining in the
ﬁtted model. For example, every pairwise comparison between
clusters should be informative as well as their holistic

ABSTRACT

Summary: HippDB catalogs every protein—protein interaction whose
structure is available in the Protein Data Bank and which exhibits one
or more helices at the interface. The Web site accepts queries on
variables such as helix length and sequence, and it provides compu-
tational alanine scanning and change in solvent-accessible surface
area values for every interfacial residue. HippDB is intended to serve
as a starting point for structure-based small molecule and peptidomi-
metic drug development.

Availability and implementation: HippDB is freely available on the
web at http://www.nyu.edu/projects/arora/hippdb. The Web site is im-
plemented in PHP, MySQL and Apache. Source code freely available
for download at http://code.google.com/p/helidb, implemented in Perl
and supported on Linux.

1 INTRODUCTION

Proteineprotein interactions (PPIs) mediate fundamental signal-
ing pathways and cellular processes. Although PPIs are highly
promising pharmaceutical targets, they are not preferred targets
in conventional drug development because of their extended ﬂat
interfaces. In particular, compound libraries for high-throughput
screening that offer attractive lead compounds for enzymatic tar-
gets lack the topological and functional complexity necessary for
PPI inhibition (Hajduk and Greer, 2007; Raj et al., 2013; Wells
and McClendon, 2007). One successful method to inhibit PPIs is
the mimicry of secondary structure motifs that contribute to com-
plex formation (Azzarito et al., 2013; Boersma et al., 2012; J ochim
and Arora, 2010; Moellering et al., 2009; Patgiri et al., 2011).
Often a subset of the residues at a proteineprotein interface can
contribute signiﬁcantly to the binding interaction (Clackson and
Wells, 1995). Because solubility and specificity are eternal prob-
lems in drug design, it is advantageous to identify and prioritize
most important residues, leaving less important positions free for
ﬁne-tuning (Bullock et al., 2011; J ochim and Arora, 2010).
Conventional computational methods to predict important
residues include alanine scanning (J ochim and Arora, 2010;
Kortemme and Baker, 2002; Kortemme et al., 2004) and solv-
ent-accessible surface area (ASASA) analysis (Koes and

Camacho, 2012). Alanine scanning provides the change in AG
resulting from a contact residue being mutated to alanine, while
a ASASA value describes how much of the residue is buried from
solvent on binding. We have previously developed a scoring strat-
egy to rank protein interfaces by their promise for synthetic inhib-
ition (Bullock et al., 2011; J ochim and Arora, 2010) and designed
inhibitors of formerly ‘undruggable’ PPIs (Patgiri et al., 2011).

To follow-up this work, we sought to derive a readily access-
ible resource for the chemical biology community. Research
groups with potent small-molecule scaffolds might be interested
in small interfaces with hotspot residues in two consecutive pos-
itions or in the i and i+4 positions, whereas those developing
peptoid or beta-peptide foldamers might be more interested in
long interfaces with high total AAG. HippDBia database of
helical interfaces in PPIsilists all the helical PPIs in the Protein
Data Bank (PDB) and catalogs computational alanine scanning
results (AAG in Rosetta energy units) and ASASA for each
interfacial residue. We expect this dataset will be a useful
resource for PPI inhibition.

Figure 1 depicts a typical workﬁow in HippDB. The user
might ﬁrst search for interface helices found in humans by con-
straining the organism name. Next, the user might trim the
results for complexes with exactly three hotspot residues, then
for helices <10 residues long, then for a AAG average >2. By
clicking on the PDB codes that result, the user can View any of
the ﬁve complexes fitting these criteria in JMol, with their
hotspot residues displayed in wireframe.

2 METHODS

Structures of multi-entity protein complexes’ asymmetric units were ob-
tained from the PDB (Berman et al., 2000). We identified all interacting
interface chains within each PDB ﬁle and created a new PDB ﬁle for each
chain and each pair of interacting chains. If the original PDB ﬁle con-
tained more than one model, only the lowest-scoring model was used
(according to Rosetta’s ‘Relax’ protocol).

Each qualifying pair of chains was analyzed using the RosettaScripts
AlaScan ﬁlter, averaging 100 runs (Baker and Sali, 2001; Fleishman et al.,
2011). Following alanine scanning, we isolated all interface helices con-
taining two or more hotspot residues (A AG >1.0 Rosetta energy units,
which approximately scale as lkcal/mol) and computed ASASA using
NACCESS (Hubbard and Thornton, 1993). Interface helices were
required to possess at least four consecutive residues, each assigned as
helical by Dictionary of Secondary Structure Prediction acquired from
the Center for Molecular and Biomolecular Informatics Web site
(Kabsch and Sander, 1983). For each interface helix, parameters includ-
ing average and total AAG and ASASA, the percentage of the complex’s
AAG and ASASA contributed by the helix, the helix length, hotspot

distance and sequence and the organism of origin are recorded in the
database.

The Web site interface uses original JavaScript for constructing
queries, a standard AJAX protocol to execute the queries and a JQuery
extension (DataTables) to format the query results (Table 1).

3 RESULTS

From 11 818 multiprotein entries in the PDB, 379 877 ﬁles of two
protein chains were produced and subjected to alanine scanning.
Of these interfaces, we found 7308 helices of four residues or
longer with the two hotspots necessary to qualify for the data-
base. A qualifying alpha helix is, on average, 13.2 residues long
and contains 2.7 hotspots. The end-to-end distance separating
these hotspots is 7.3 residues. On average, the three best hotspot
residues sum to a AG of 3.9 in Rosetta energy units, and the
helix overall contributes 48% of the chain’s total AAG and 37%
of its ASASA.

The rational design of PPI inhibitors involves a systematic
analysis of native interactions. By cataloging the results of this

analysis for every known structure, and by describing second-
order metrics to help prioritize design efforts, this database will
eliminate often-reduplicated effort and greatly accelerate the
design process. In this way, HippDB complements existing re-
sources such as PocketQuery and HotSprint, the former of which
catalogues regions of high solvent burial and the latter of which
highlights evolutionary conservation to evaluate the role, func-
tional or structural, of individual hotspots (Camacho and Koes,
2012; Guney et al., 2008).

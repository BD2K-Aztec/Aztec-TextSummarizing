Abstract

Motivation: Phosphorylation—dependent cellular signaling is known to play a diverse role in regu—
lating multiple cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Recent
technological advances in mass spectrometry—based phosphoproteomics have enabled us to
measure network—wide signaling dynamics in a comprehensive and quantitative manner. As
conventional protein—protein interaction (PPI) information—based network analysis is insufficient to
systematically analyze phosphorylation site—dependent complex interaction dynamics, here we
develop and evaluate a platform to provide a high—resolution molecular network description for kin—
ase—substrate interactome analysis.

Results: In this study, we developed a Cytoscape—based bioinformatical platform named 'Post
Translational Modification mapper (PTMapper)’ to integrate PPI data with publicly available kinase—
substrate relations at the resolution of phosphorylated amino acid residues. The previous phos—
phoproteome data on EGF—induced cellular signaling in glioblastoma stem cells was applied to
evaluate our platform, leading to discovery of phosphorylation—dependent crucial signaling modu—
lation in the p7086K1—related pathway. Our study revealed that high—resolution cellular network
description of phosphorylation—site dependent kinase—substrate signaling regulation should accel—
erate phosphoproteomics—based exploration of novel drug targets in the context of each disease—
related signaling.

Availability and Implementation: PTMapper and the example data for construction of phosphoryl—
ation site—oriented networks are available at https://github.com/y—narushima/PTMapper.

1 Introduction

Protein phosphorylation is one of the most well—known post transla—
tional modifications (PTMs) at serine, threonine and tyrosine residues
within protein sequences and plays important roles in various cellular
signaling pathways correlated with cell fate control. Due to the tech—
nical development of phosphoprotein/peptide enrichment methodolo—
gies and the analytical improvement of LC—MS/MS systems,
quantitative phosphoproteomics are now widely used to uncover glo—
bal phosphorylation dynamics in cellular signaling networks (Sharma
et al., 2014). As with the analysis of genome and transcriptome data,
advanced computational methodology is essential to translate phos—
phoproteome data into high—resolution protein interaction networks
towards better understanding of the detailed biological mechanisms
triggered by phosphorylation—dependent signal transduction.

Quantitative phosphoproteomics—based network analyses could be
mainly categorized into the two methods: (i) visualization of activation
dynamics by mapping the quantification data to each signaling mol—
ecules and (ii) sub—network extraction through the statistical calcula—
tion of network/pathway enrichment based on the quantified
phosphoproteome data. The former is basically used for explanation of
phosphorylation—related fold changes in particular signaling pathways
(Humphrey et al., 2013; van den Biggelaar et al., 2014). The latter en—
ables us to unbiasedly reveal functionally important parts of signaling
networks which reﬂect quantitative changes observed in the phospho—
proteome data, leading to discovery of regulatory interactions unanno—
tated in the conventional signaling pathways (Olsen et al., 2010; Stahl
et al., 2013). These network analyses are mainly based on protein—
protein interaction (PPI) information, although the phosphorylation—
induced reaction is controlled by site—specific kinases/phosphatases.

In recent studies, the information on enzyme—substrate relation—
ships between kinases and the corresponding phosphorylation sites
has rapidly accumulated in public phosphorylation site databases,
such as PhosphoSitePlus (Hornbeck et al., 2012), Phospho.ELM
(Dinkel et al., 2011) and PhosphoNetworks (Hu et al., 2014). The
representative protein databases, including Uniprot KB (Magrane and
Consortium U, 2011), Human Protein Reference Database (Keshava
Prasad et al., 2009) and netirot (Lane et al., 2012), also keep updat—
ing the large—scale information on phosphoyrlation sites and their spe—
cific kinases. In spite of the drastic expansion of these public
databases, there are few platforms to analyze quantitative phospho—
proteome data using the kinase—phosphorylation site datasets as noted
above. Moreover, phosphorylation site—oriented network analysis is
mainly applied for visualization of phosphoproteome data, but not
for statistical interpretation of network dynamics. Therefore, we de—
veloped a Cytoscape—based network analysis platform named ‘Post
Translational Modification mapper (PTMapper)’, which enables us to
describe phosphorylation site—dependent PPI dynamics and statistic—
ally analyze network properties through combination with other
Cytoscape applications. The PTMapper—based analysis of our previ—
ous quantitative phosphoproteome data on EGF—stimulated glioblast—
oma stem cells (Kozuka—Hata et al., 2012) led to discovery of
phosphorylation—dependent association regarding the p7056K1—
related pathway upon EGF stimulation, which was not unveiled in
the network structure based on the conventional PPI information.

2 Methods

2.1 Construction of kinase—phosphorylation site
interaction dataset

The comprehensive kinase—phosphorylation site interaction dataset was
constructed through integration of the data from the four public human

protein databases; PhosphoSitePlus (7822 interactions), Phospho.ELM
(2132 interactions), PhosphoNetworks (4417 interactions) and Uniprot
KB (2775 interactions), leading to generation of 13 620 non—redundant
interactions (Supplemental Table S1). The prediction data on the up—
stream kinases and their corresponding phosphorylation sites was
retrieved from NetworKIN 3.0 (Horn et al., 2014).

2.2 Visualization of phosphorylation site—oriented

PPI network

In order to visualize the phosphorylation site—oriented PPI networks,
we developed a Java—based Cytoscape application named
PTMapper, which has been tested in Cytoscape version 3.2.1 and
3.3.0 with Java 8 on 64—bit version of Windows 7 and 8. In this
study, we applied the phosphoproteome data on EGF—stimulated
glioblastoma stem cells as an example input (Kozuka—Hata et al.,
2012), which contained the quantitative information on 2805 phos—
phorylation sites corresponding to 1276 proteins. The PPI networks
based on the phosphoproteome data was constructed using Pathway
Commons (Cerami et al., 2011). In order to focus on phosphoryl—
ation—related functional changes of each molecule, four types of
interactions defined in Pathway Commons (‘control expression of’,
‘controls phosphorylation of’, ‘controls state change of’ and ‘con—
trols transport of’) were used to depict PPI networks. After visualiza—
tion of the PPI networks using Cytoscape, the nodes for
phosphorylation sites and the edges for kinase—phosphorylation site
relations were added to the network through PTMapper to construct
phosphorylation site—oriented PPI networks. (See Supplemental
Material for more detailed information.)

2.3 Active sub—network extraction based on quantitative
phosphoproteome data

From the constructed interaction networks, sub—networks signifi—
cantly regulated by EGF stimulation were then extracted using a
Cytoscape application, jActiveModules (Ideker et al., 2002), which
can identify active subnetvvorks by combination of a rigorous
statistical measure for scoring subnetvvorks with a simulated anneal—
ing—based search algorithm. Brieﬂy, jActiveModules enables us to
calculate the Z—scores based on the P—values of quantitative changes
and search network clusters with high significance scores by adding
or removing nodes in the clusters through the iteration process of
simulated annealing. The significance of differentially regulated
phosphorylation site was calculated as significance A, which is
defined as P—value for detection of significant outlier ratios
(Graumann et al., 2008). The extraction of sub—networks was then
conducted through simulated annealing based on the following par—
ameters: overlap threshold : 0.8, the number of iteration : 100 000,
starting temperature: 1, ending temperature: 0.001, adjust score
for size : active. These parameters were optimized according to the
original article regarding jActiveModules (Ideker et al., 2002).

3 Results and discussion

3.1 Construction and characterization of PPI networks

from quantitative phosphoproteome data by PTMapper
In order to analyze phosphorylation site—oriented PPI networks, we
developed a Cytoscape—based application ‘PTMapper’, which enables
us to add the information on phosphorylation sites and their
upstream kinases to conventional PPI networks generated from phos—
phoproteome data (Fig. 1A). Construction of phosphorylation site—
oriented networks through PTMapper consists of three steps as
described below: (i) the integrated dataset on kinases,

networks via PTMapper. Phosphorylation sites are connected with the parental protein nodes in PPI networks (red) and the upstream kinases are then added to
the phosphorylation sites (green). (b) Phosphorylation site-oriented networks constructed from the phosphoproteome data on EGF-stimulated glioblastoma stem

cells. The color of nodes shows up-regulation (red) or down-regulation (blue)
ected protein—protein interactions or kinase-substrate interactions, whereas the

phosphorylation sites and their relationships were imported into
PTMapper (see Supplemental Table S1). (ii) The nodes for phosphor—
ylation sites were visualized in the PPI networks and connected with
the parental protein nodes. (iii) The nodes for upstream kinases were
linked with those of corresponding phosphorylation sites. When the
upstream kinases in the integrated dataset did not exist in the already
constructed networks, they were additionally visualized in the net—
works. In order to evaluate the pipeline for the PTMapper—based net—
work analysis, we first created a PPI—based conventional network
regarding our previous quantitative phosphoproteome data on EGF—
stimulated glioblastoma stem cells using Pathway Commons (Cerami
et al., 2011). The kinase—phosphorylation site information was then
added to the PPI network through PTMapper based on the phosphor—
ylation site dataset which was integrated from PhosphoSitePlus
(Hornbeck et al., 2012), Phospho.ELM (Dinkel et al., 2011),
PhosphoNetworks (Hu et al., 2014) and Uniprot KB (Magrane and
Consortium U, 2011). After the annotation of the network nodes
with their quantitative ratios and significances, we then compared
the detailed structure of the phosphorylation site—oriented network

regarding the phosphorylation level. The solid arrows represent functionally dir-
dotted lines show the linkages of proteins and their phosphorylation sites

with that of the original PPI network. The conventional PPI network
consisted of 389 protein nodes and 1553 PPI edges, whereas the
phosphorylation site—oriented network consisted of 1581 nodes for
the proteins and phosphorylation sites as well as 2931 edges for their
relationships. In the PTMapper—based network structure, 1105 phos—
phorylation sites and 87 kinases were added to the original PPI net—
work, and the kinase—phosphorylation site relationships and their
phosphorylation changes were visualized in a high—resolution manner
as described in Figure 1B.

3.2 Comparative description of conventional and
phosphorylation site—oriented PPI network structures
Administration of EGF is known to be necessary for maintenance of
stemness characteristics in glioblastoma stem cells (Lee et al., 2006;
Singh et al., 2003). EGF—regulated sub—networks were extracted
based on the significance of phosphorylation changes using
jActiveModules, a Cytoscape application which can identify the
highest scoring sub—network by simulated annealing algorithm

the phosphorylation level. The nodes surrounded by the yellow border with the upper-right numbers indicate the common molecules in the two types of the sub-
networks. The solid black arrows represent functionally directed protein—protein interactions or kinase—substrate interactions, whereas the dotted lines show the
linkages of proteins and their phosphorylation sites. The red- and blue-dashed circle indicates p7086K and Lyn, respectively

(Ideker et al., 2002). As a result of the iteration search by
jActiveModules, the sub—network composed of 87 nodes and 141
edges was extracted from the PTMapper—based high—resolution net—
work, whereas the sub—network composed of 16 nodes and 40 edges
was from the original PPI network (Fig. 2). Although 13 proteins
were common between these two sub—networks, 7 kinases were spe—
cifically observed in the phosphorylation site—oriented network.
Both of these sub—networks were found to contain mTOR signaling—
related molecules, such as ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6) and riboso—
mal protein S6 kinase alpha—1 (p90S6K), which reﬂected our previ—
ous result that mTOR signaling—related proteins were highly

activated in EGF—regulated phosphoproteome dynamics (Kozuka—
Hata et al., 2012). Furthermore, ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta—1
(p7OS6K), which is a key member of mTOR signaling to phosphor—
ylate S6 protein of the 40S ribosomal subunit and control mRNA
translation, was specifically extracted as a significantly regulated
kinase in our PTMapper—based analysis. In relation to glioblastoma
stem cells, p70S6K was found to be important for maintenance of
self—renewal and tumorigenicity through controlling the signaling
balance between MEK/ERK and PI3K/mTOR pathways (Sunayama
et al., 2010). The expression of hypoxia—inducible factor 1—alpha
(HIFTCX), which is involved in stemness maintenance of glioblastoma

stem cells under hypoxia conditions, was also reported to be regu—
lated through p70S6K—dependent activation of PI3K pathway
(Qiang et al., 2012). Furthermore, tyrosine—protein kinase Lyn, one
of the Src family kinases, was specifically highlighted in the active
sub—network generated through PTMapper. The association of Lyn
with S6K was reported to promote survival of glioblastoma cell lines
as well as glioblastoma stem cells (Liu et al., 2013). Thus, these re—
sults indicated that our strategy based on phosphorylation site—ori—
ented network construction enabled us to perform efficient
extraction of kinase—dependent crucial regulations from large—scale
phosphoproteome data.

3.3 Evaluation of phosphorylation site—oriented network
analysis pipeline based on kinase—phosphorylation site
prediction

In order to evaluate the versatility of our PTMapper—based pipeline,
we then retrieved the data on upstream kinase prediction regarding
each phosphorylation site from NetworKIN 3.0, which is a web—
based kinase prediction tool based on the amino acid sequence motif
around the phosphorylation site and the PPI information on the cor—
responding phosphoprotein (Horn et al., 2014). We performed
phosphorylation site—specific kinase prediction regarding our phos—
phoproteome data and applied the prediction results to the
PTMapper—based high—resolution network analysis. A total of 2851
relationships between the predicted kinases and their corresponding
phosphorylation sites were added to the original PPI network, lead—
ing to the observation that mTOR signaling—related proteins includ—
ing p70S6K were extracted as one of the significantly regulated sub—
networks (Fig. 3 and Supplemental Fig. S1). Our result implied that
the PTMapper—based bioinformatical pipeline could be applicable
for various types of large—scale kinase—phosphorylation site data.

4 Conclusion

In this study, we developed a bioinformatical platform named
PTMapper to characterize the structures of phosphorylation site—ori—
ented PPI networks. From the quantitative phosphoproteome data
on EGF—stimulated glioblastoma stem cells, our PTMapper—based
network analysis unveiled p70S6K—related signaling as one of the
most significantly regulated sub—networks, which was not observed
in the conventional PPI network. As some previous studies demon—
strated that p70S6K was correlated with survival and stemness
maintenance of glioblastoma stem cells, the strategy based on phos—
phorylation site—oriented network analysis proved to be effective to
unbiasedly extract crucial signaling pathways from the complex sig—
naling networks. Our PTMapper—based computational pipeline will
be applied not only to phosphorylation but also to other PTMs such
as acetylation and ubiquitination, and contribute to further under—
standing of highly diversified PTM—dependent PPI networks.

Gene regulatory network structure

 

2 METHODS

2.1 Model organism and data processing

To study cell differentiation, we used the curated genetic regulatory net-
work of Cui et a]. (2007). A basic concept in Boolean networks is that
each node has at least one regulator, which determines its Boolean value
at each time step. Therefore, genes that have no regulators were removed
from the network (recursively). Another set of genes that were removed
(again recursively) are genes that do not regulate other genes. These genes
have no effect on the dynamics of the network, and their removal has no
effect on the results. The resulting processed network contains 435 nodes
(the vast majority are genes or their products) and 1550 edges between
them, 1196 of which are of positive regulation and 354 are of negative
regulation. The network has seven small loops, each with two genes.
There was a single large multiply connected component containing 418
genes. Some of the small loops were found to inﬂuence the large multiply
connected loop, whereas others were found to be inﬂuenced by it. By
deﬁnition, none of the small loops both inﬂuences and is inﬂuenced by
the large multiply connected loop. The three remaining genes connected
the different loops. Because the small loops that inﬂuence the large one
were likely to create a bias, the analysis was performed using only the
large multiply connected loop, which will be denoted as the ‘human
network’ (HN) in the following sections. In Supplementary Section S1,
we discuss the detailed effect of the removal of the small loops.
In Supplementary Section S2, we present the small loops.

The HN has an average degree of 3.6 :l: 3.8, and a scale-free distribu-
tion for both the in- and the out-degree (Supplementary Section S3). The
typical distance between nodes in the graph is approximately a Poisson
distribution with a typical distance of 6 :|:2 (Supplementary Section S3)
and a relatively low clustering coefﬁcient of 0.03. These features are simi-
lar to what is often reported in regulatory networks (Ahn et al., 2009;
Gama-Castro et al., 2011; Itzhack et al., 2013).

2.2 Theoretical model for cellular differentiation

2.2.1 Boolean networks The edges between the genes and their signs
provide only partial information for the definition of a Boolean network.
The regulatory function of each gene (describing how it is inﬂuenced by
its regulatory genes, e.g. NAND) must be given as well. There are mul-
tiple options for each gene, e.g. a gene with two positive regulators may
have AND or OR as its regulatory function. Because setting the regula-
tory function for gene is independent of the other genes, the total number
of Boolean networks that are consistent with the HN data is at least
exponential to the number of genes that have more than a single regulator
(which are the vast majority of the genes). Thus, the HN represents a
family of Boolean networks, consistent with the HN data.

Here, we assign a Boolean function consistent with the number of
activators and repressors each gene has. These Boolean functions are
called nested canalyzing Boolean functions, as will be explained. Harris
et a]. (2002) have shown that the functions describing genetic regulation
in eukaryotes are canalyzing. Kauffman et a]. (2004) reanalyzed these
data and have shown that practically all the functions of gene regulation
in eukaryotes are nested canalyzing Boolean functions (NCBF) (see
Supplementary Section S4 for deﬁnition and example). Thus, although
there are many possible ways to reproduce a random Boolean network
from observed networks, the choice of nested canalyzing functions seems
to be the most appropriate from a biological point of view. Given this
deﬁnition, the network produced is based on the selection of the hierarchy
of the variables in the nested canalyzing function, which was random in
this case, as no information was available on the hierarchy between each
gene’s regulators (Supplementary Section S4).

2.2.2 Computer—simulated diﬁ’erentiation—like events in random
Boolean networks We have previously developed a general frame-
work to model differentiation-like events in random Boolean networks

(Bodaker et al., 2013). We investigated these differentiation-like events in
systems based on random Boolean networks given a set of signaling
nodes and two cycles. Basically, we studied networks that can converge
to at least two different cycles. A cycle is a ﬁnite cyclic set of states of the
network that a Boolean network can converge to (each cycle has a ﬁnite
number of steps that evolve in time from one to the other and finally the
last step evolves to the ﬁrst one). Given such a network, we studied two
cells (both represented by similar networks) each resting in a different
cycle, and tested whether using a given subset of the nodes in one cell as
inputs to the other cell can drive the second cell to be in the same cycle as
the ﬁrst cell. We denote the cell changing its cycle as the induced cell and
the other cell as the inducing cell.

2.2.3 Unsynchronized conversions From the biological point of view
most adult tissues are in steady state, with new cells being produced
continuously to offset the number of dying cells. Thus, constant differ-
entiation of tissue stem cells is observed in multiple adult organs, such as
the intestine, the skin and blood (Barker et al., 2010; Pittenger et al.,
1999). This led us to model differentiation as a change in a simulated
cell that is independent in the initial step both of the cycle the induced cell
rests in and of the cycle the inducing cell rests in. We named the differ-
entiation-like events as unsynchronized quality conversion (UQC), which
occurs if the induced cell always changes its cycle to the same cycle,
following signals from the inducing cell. For UQC to occur, we require
that the conversion should not depend on the phase of the two cycles. The
cycle that the induced cycle converged to is referred to as the target cycle.
A detailed technical deﬁnition of UQC in a network is given in Bodaker
et a]. (2013).

2.2.4 Algorithm for detecting candidate nodes to enable the diﬁ’er—
entiation—like events Based on the UQC concept, we have developed
an a priori algorithm to detect nodes that can serve as signaling nodes
between two cycles and induce UQC. Although the detailed mathematical
details of the algorithm were previously explained (Bodaker et al., 2013),
we here provide a short explanation of the basic principles driving this
algorithm, see Supplementary Section S5 for the detailed steps of the
algorithm. Each node in the network represents a gene or a protein.
The algorithm works mostly by elimination:

(1) Eliminate nodes that behave similarly between the two cycles
(basically have the same patterns between the two cycles).

(2) Eliminate nodes that neither can close a directed circle nor link
between directed circles in the remaining graph.

(3) Eliminate the nodes that are not ﬁxed in both cycles.

(4) Select the remaining nodes as candidates to induce UQC.

We have found that if nodes are selected according to the previous
algorithm, in >90% of the cases, UQC will occur. Similar performances
of the algorithm were also obtained for Boolean networks consistent with
the HN. However, our previous work focused on the pure mathematical
aspects of the algorithm on these networks with no biological meaning
(Bodaker et al., 2013).

2.2.5 Sets of nodes derived from the algorithm As mentioned, the
algorithm works mostly by elimination. After the ﬁrst step of eliminating
the nodes that behave similarly between the cycles, the two remaining
types of nodes can be categorized: (i) nodes found in loops (which may be
multiply connected) and (ii) nodes found in simple paths (paths that do
not close a circle). The simple paths themselves can also be categorized:
(i) simple paths linking between loops and (ii) simple paths that end with
nodes that do not regulate any of the remaining nodes. These remaining
loops are referred in graph theory as strongly connected components
(SCCs). Categorizing the remaining strongly connected components
(RSCCs) is less trivial and is beyond the scope of simple deﬁnitions of
graph theory.

M. Bodaker et al.

 

To further reduce the number of converting nodes, we further elimi-
nated nodes from the signaling set, if the conversion could occur without
them. Following this removal, RSCCs can be categorized into two kinds,
the ones that contain nodes found in the reduced signaling sets and the
ones that do not contain such nodes. The nodes found in the RSCCs and
are essential for differentiation in the algorithm are the ones we believe
are the most critical nodes for the conversion to occur. Therefore,
through the following analysis, we rank all nodes by the fraction of simu-
lation, where they belong to this set of RSCCs, referred to as sufﬁcient
RSCCs. For a precise deﬁnition and explanation of the logic behind these
deﬁnitions, see a previously more theoretical analysis (Bodaker et al.,
2013, Supplementary Section S6).

2.2.6 Frequency of participation in conversions We tested whether
genes in the HN associated with the theoretical model of UQC are also
associated with cell differentiation in the literature. The genes of the HN
were sorted according to the frequency of their participation in UQC as
follows (a single simulation takes on average a couple of minutes on a
single core and the analysis presented here was performed on a grid with
32 cores):

(1) A total of 10000 Boolean networks consistent with the HN were
created. This was performed by choosing randomly, for each gene,
a Boolean function consistent with the number of activators and
repressors the gene has, according to the HN as described in
Section 2.

(2) In all, 1 000 initial random states were iterated until they converged
to different cycles.

(3) If at least two cycles were observed, two cycles were randomly
picked.

(4) The algorithm searched for candidate genes to induce UQC, as
mentioned earlier in the text.

(5) If candidate genes were found and UQC occurred and the target
cycle was native (a cycle that exists in the Boolean network in
absence of the cellicell interactions), the score of the set of genes
within the sufﬁcient remaining strongly connected components (the
sufﬁcient RSCCs) was augmented by one.

(6) The list of the genes of the HN was sorted according to their score.
This list is referred to as the ‘genes scored list’ (GSL).

2.3 GO-based gene classification

To classify genes, the Gene Ontology (GO) annotations of each gene
were retrieved using the ID converter tool (http://idconverter.bioinfo.cnio.
es/) by using their Entrez serial number. At this point, it was necessary to
determine if a G0 annotation is related to differentiation. The genes that
participate in UQC not only initiate the conversion but also maintain it.
Therefore, GO annotations related to cell differentiation and the signal-
ing pathways of the factors initiating differentiations are of interest. To
detect the GO annotations related to each gene, a two-step procedure was
used:

First, using the CateGOrizer (http://www.animalgenome.org/tools/
catego/) tool, GO annotations related to cell differentiation were
added. Then, GO annotations related to the signaling pathways of the
factors initiating differentiations were sought using the key words ‘growth
factor’ and ‘signaling pathway’ (all the results were then manually
checked to insure that they are related to relevant processes). Taking
only the genes related to cell differentiation by the CateGOrizer yielded
similar results but with a smaller number of genes. Here, we only report
the results for the full list. Results for the list produced directly by the
CateGOrizer are given in Supplementary Section S7.

2.4 Statistical methods

Rank test. To check if the order of the GSL is correlated with cellular
differentiation, we used the ‘gene set enrichment analysis rank test’
(Subramanian et al., 2005):

(1) Let q denote the proportion of the genes in the list that are related
to cellular differentiation.

(2) Create a vector of weights W, where W(i) is as follows:

A. 1—q if the gene in that index in the list is related to cellular
differentiation.

B. —q otherwise.
(3) Compute the cumulative sum of W: S(i) =W(1)+ . . . +W(i).

(4) Record the maximum of S.

For all permutation of the list of genes, the last element in S will be
zero. To approximate how improbable is the null hypothesis that the two
groups are ordered randomly in the list, the maximal value of S was
compared with the maximal value distribution of T permuted lists. The
one sided P-value of the null hypothesis is the fraction of permutations
with maximal values equal to or greater than the maximum of the
real list.

Hypergeometric distribution. Although the rank test produces a good
visualization of how the genes are sorted by participation, the P-value
retrieved from the maximum of S represents a peak that does not neces-
sarily occur at the beginning of the list. To show that the top of the list
sorted by participation is enriched with genes that are related to cell
differentiation, we use a threshold that separates the beginning of the
list from the rest of the list and compute the fraction of nodes belonging
to the group within the upper part of the list. This number is expected to
be distributed following a hypergeometric distribution. The threshold
that was used here is the top 15% of the list of the genes.

Spearman correlation and Mann—Whitney test. When comparing differ-
ent scores for the list of genes, a Spearman correlation was used, and
when comparing the average score of genes belonging to different sets, a
Mann7Whitney test was performed. Non-parametric tests were used, as
the distribution of scores was not a normal distribution.

Fraction of differentiation genes—Enrichment test. In each of the pre-
viously presented statistical methods, it was assumed that the correlation
among the genes is negligible. This may lead to an overestimate of the
signiﬁcance of the results. To test the signiﬁcance of the correlation in a
different way, we computed the fraction of genes with a G0 annotation
related to differentiation out of all the genes found in the sufﬁcient
RSCCs of the conversion. Clearly the conversions are independent ob-
servations. The population of scores was compared with the fraction of
genes related to differentiation out of the entire network. We then per-
formed a one-sample t-test.

2.5 Control networks

To measure the dependence of the algorithm to generic properties of the
HN, two types of control networks were examined.

0 The ﬁrst type of networks was produced to maintain the in-degree
and out-degree of each node. This type of networks was produced by
permuting the edges of the HN by switching between pairs of edges
(i,j) and (k,l) and replacing them by (i,l) and (k,j). In a rewired HN,
each gene has the same number of activators and inhibitors as in the
HN. We validated that the resulting graph is one large strongly con-
nected component like the HN.

Ten such ‘rewired-HNs’ were created. Each of the 10 represents a
different family of Boolean networks. For each of the 10 ‘rewired-
HNs’, the routine performed for the HN in Section 2.2.6 was performed
as well, i.e. Boolean networks consistent with their wiring and signs were

created and its genes were scored according to their participation in the
conversions. Then the list of genes was sorted according to the mean
score the gene had in the different 10 ‘rewired-HNs’.

o Signed scrambled networks were produced by randomly switching
the signs of the edges, while keeping the edges themselves. The frac-
tion of activating and inhibiting edges was maintained. Clearly, this
control network is more similar to the HN. Similarly, 10 such ‘signed
scrambled-HNs’ were created, and the routine performed for the HN
in Section 2.2.6 was performed as well for each of the 10 families of
networks. Finally, the list of genes was sorted according to the mean
score the gene had in the different 10 ‘signed scrambled-HNs’.

3 RESULTS

We created Boolean networks consistent with the HN by choos—
ing, randomly for each gene, a Boolean function consistent with
the activators and repressors it has according to the Cui et al.
(2007) network. For each network, we checked whether a con—
version between two random cycles could occur. The conversion
is a model of differentiation—like events in random Boolean net—
works (Bodaker et al., 2013). We investigated these simulated
differentiation—like events using a set of signaling nodes. Simply
stated, a conversion in this context is the transfer of a Boolean
network from one attractor to another following signaling from
neighboring cells. To determine which genes (nodes in the net—
work) are the most critical for the conversion, a multistep process
was performed. First, genes that behave similarly in the two
cycles were eliminated (see Section 2). Then we chose within
these genes those that could induce a cycle conversion. Among
those, we removed the genes residing in loops that do not affect
the conversion as explained in Section 2. We computed how
often each gene belongs to the resulting set of converting genes
in these simulations.

The result of this process is a list of genes ordered by the
fraction of simulations where each gene is predicted to partici—
pate in signaling that induces cell conversion. This list is referred
to as the GSL. If our assumption that conversion is related to the
network structure and if our algorithm is correct, we expect the
result of this purely theoretical argument to be correlated with
the experimental observations of differentiations. To show that
this is the case, we analyzed the order of the genes in the GSL.

Among the genes at the top 5% of the GSL are IL4R (inter—
leukin 4 receptor), Mitogen—activated protein/extracellular
signal—regulated kinase 1 (MEKl), extracellular signal—regulated
kinase 2 (ERK2), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and
(nuclear factor kappa—light—chain—enhancer of activated B cells
(NF—kB). These genes play key roles in known important differ—
entiation processes. IL4R is a type I cytokine receptor, that by
binding to interleukin 4 promotes the differentiation of T cells to
Th2 cells (Nelms et al., 1999). MEKl and ERK2 are involved in
several differentiation processes including neuronal differenti—
ation (Pang et al., 1995). The EGFR is a cell surface receptor
for members of the epidermal growth factor family. It is involved
in many differentiation processes (Herbst, 2004). NF—kB is a
protein complex that controls the transcription of DNA. NF—
kB is known not only for activating B cells (Liou et al., 1994)
but also for osteogenic differentiation (Cho et al., 2009). The top
5% of the GSL is found in Table 1. The full GSL is given in
Supplementary Section S8.

Note: The full list is given in Supplementary Section SS. We have used multiple
methods to determine whether a gene is related to differentiation. The second
column represents genes with published literature describing them as linked to dif—
ferentiation (see column 5 for typical reference). The third column represents genes
with a G0 annotation related to differentiation and the fourth column represents
genes related to differentiation using the Categorizer automatic GO hierarchy ana—
lyzer (http://www.animalgenome.org/tools/catego/).

The top ranking genes are not the only ones related to differ—
entiation. Actually, a clear correlation between the order of genes
in the list and the deﬁnitions of genes related to differentiation
based on their GO classiﬁcation can be found throughout the list.

We compared the order of genes obtained from the algorithm
with genes associated with differentiation using the GO annota—
tion (see Section 2), using four statistical tests. According to the
GO—based gene classiﬁcation, 25% of the studied genes are asso—
ciated with cellular differentiation. However, when scoring the
genes according to the fraction of time they participate in differ—
entiation in the theoretical model (which will be denoted the
sorted list hitherto), 43% of the top 15% of the list are related
to differentiation (P: 0.0006) (Table 2). The results are not sen—
sitive to the cutoff, and a 10/20% cutoff led to P=0.006 and
P=0.002, respectively. Similarly, throughout the entire list,
genes associated with differentiation have higher scores
(P:0.005 for the ManniWhitney test and P200011 for the
gene rank test) (Fig. 1 and Table 2).

The P—values of these tests can be affected by correlation be—
tween neighboring genes in the network. We thus used an extra
test, the enrichment test, which avoids such biases. We computed
for each conversion the fraction of nodes with G0 annotations
related to differentiation out of the nodes in the sufﬁcient RSCCs

applied to create a novel bioinformatics tool for gene classiﬁca—
tion and can also assist experimental biologists that wish to
induce differentiation to cells in vitro and in vivo.

An important result from our previous theoretical work
(Bodaker et al., 2013) is that conversions are mostly reversible.
Unlike the process of iPSCs (induced pluripotent stem cells),
where fully differentiated cells become pluripotent by the ectopic
expression of key transcription factors (Takahashi et al., 2007;
Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006), we suggested (Bodaker et al.,
2013) that differentiated cells can be used as precursor cells to the
tissue stem cells from which they originated by overexpressing
relevant genes’ products. The presented methodology can be
applied to assist experimental biologists that wish to attempt
such a process.

Boolean networks were initially developed to study theoretical
concepts such as the number of possible attractors in a random
network or their properties (Harris et al., 2002; Kauffman et al.,
2003, 2004). Here, we have shown that these networks can have
direct practical application for the classiﬁcation of genes. This is
the first time that such applications are presented for a concept
that was considered purely theoretical. We have shown that by
pure mathematical analysis of well—curated gene networks, we
can predict the genes that are associated with differentiation.
The algorithms that we have developed will become more and
more usede as the gene networks will grow and expand in the
future.

Abstract

Motivation: Circadian oscillations have been observed in animals, plants, fungi and cyanobacteria
and play a fundamental role in coordinating the homeostasis and behavior of biological systems.
Genetically encoded molecular clocks found in nearly every cell, based on negative transcription/
translation feedback loops and involving only a dozen genes, play a central role in maintaining
these oscillations. However, high—throughput gene expression experiments reveal that in a typical
tissue, a much larger fraction (~ 10%) of all transcripts oscillate with the day—night cycle and the
oscillating species vary with tissue type suggesting that perhaps a much larger fraction of all tran—
scripts, and perhaps also other molecular species, may bear the potential for circadian oscillations.
Results: To better quantify the pervasiveness and plasticity of circadian oscillations, we conduct
the first large—scale analysis aggregating the results of 18 circadian transcriptomic studies and 10
circadian metabolomic studies conducted in mice using different tissues and under different condi—
tions. We find that over half of protein coding genes in the cell can produce transcripts that are
circadian in at least one set of conditions and similarly for measured metabolites. Genetic or envir—
onmental perturbations can disrupt existing oscillations by changing their amplitudes and phases,
suppressing them or giving rise to novel circadian oscillations. The oscillating species and their
oscillations provide a characteristic signature of the physiological state of the corresponding cell/
tissue. Molecular networks comprise many oscillator loops that have been sculpted by evolution
over two trillion day—night cycles to have intrinsic circadian frequency. These oscillating loops are
coupled by shared nodes in a large network of coupled circadian oscillators where the clock genes
form a major hub. Cells can program and re—program their circadian repertoire through epigenetic
and other mechanisms.

1 Introduction

Circadian rhythms are pervasive and play a key role in ensuring
homeostatic balance with the environment and coordinating many
aspects of physiology including the sleep/wake cycle, eating, hor—
mone and neurotransmitter secretion and even memory and cogni—
tive function (Eckel—Mahan and Sassone—Corsi, 2009; Froy, 2011;
Gerstner et al., 2009; Takahashi et al., 2008; Yoo et al., 2004).
Disruption of circadian rhythms has been directly linked to health
problems ranging from cancer, to insulin resistance, to diabetes, to
obesity and to premature ageing (Antunes et al., 2010; Froy, 2010;
Karlsson et al., 2001; Knutsson, 2003; Kohsaka et al., 2007;
Kondratov et al., 2006; Lamia et al., 2008; Sharifian et al., 2005;
Shi et al., 2013; Takahashi et al., 2008; Turek et al., 2005).
Research has shown that these circadian rhythms are genetically
encoded by a molecular clock found in nearly every cell, with a mas—
ter clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) (Moore and
Eichler, 1972; Ralph et al., 1990) of the hypothalamus, coordinating
and interacting with peripheral clocks throughout the body
(Takahashi et al., 2008; Yoo et al., 2004). Central to the cellular
clock and the rhythmicity of SCN neurons as well as other cells are
transcription factors that drive the expression of their own negative
regulators (Partch et al., 2014; Schibler and Sassone—Corsi, 2002).
This results in a negative transcriptional and translational feedback
loop, highly conserved across species, that perpetuates oscillations
in gene expression that occur every 24 h. In mammals, two bHLH
transcription factors, CLOCK and BMAL1 heterodimerize and bind
to conserved E—box sequences in target gene promoters, thus driving
the rhythmic expression of mammalian Period (Perl, PerZ and Per3)
and Cryptochrome (Cryl and CryZ) genes (Stratmann and Schibler,
2006). PER and CRY proteins form a complex that inhibits subse—
quent CLOCKzBMALl—mediated gene expression (Brown et al.,
2012; Dibner et al., 2010; Partch et al., 2014). In short, the core of
the clock is driven by only a dozen genes (Yan et al., 2008).

In contrast, gene expression experiments (Andrews et al., 2010;
Eckel—Mahan et al., 2012, 2013; Hughes et al., 2009; Masri et al.,
2014; Miller et al., 2007; Panda et al., 2002; Tognini et al., unpub—
lished data) reveal that a much larger fraction, on the order of 10%,
of all transcripts in the cell are oscillating in a circadian manner and
that the oscillating transcripts differ by cell or tissue type (Panda et
al., 2002; Storch et al., 2002; Yan et al., 2008). Thus, the number of
oscillating transcripts typically extends beyond the core clock.
However, the precise extent of this phenomenon, or its applicability
to other molecular species such as metabolites, has not been investi—
gated systematically. While researchers have looked at the common
denominator (the master clock genes and its interactors), little has
been done to systematically understand the unique and possibly
novel oscillations observed in a specific tissue or under a specific set
of perturbations. In a recent study (Eckel—Mahan et al., 2013) where
we contrasted the circadian profiles of both transcripts and metabol—
ites in the liver of mice fed normal—chow and high—fat diets, we
noticed considerable differences associated with a massive reprog—
ramming occurring within the cell. By analyzing not only the tran—
scripts and metabolites that lost their circadian oscillations as a
result of the high—fat diet but also the transcripts and metabolites
that gained novel circadian oscillations as a result of the perturb—
ation, we were able to discover compensatory oscillations in import—
ant molecular species like SREBP1, a transcription factor
responsible for lipid synthesis.

In combination, these results raise several fundamental questions
(Patel et al., 2014). Exactly how pervasive are circadian oscillations
at the molecular level, i.e. how far do they extend beyond the core

clock? What is the overlap in circadian oscillations across different
tissues and conditions? How ﬂexible and programmable are these
oscillations and what are the underlying mechanisms controlling
rhythmicity? To begin to address these questions, we conduct a
large—scale aggregated analysis of multiple circadian transcriptome
and metabolome datasets.

2 Methods

To ensure quality and consistency, we use circadian data from ex—
periments all carried in mice, with at least six time points and, in
most cases, at least three replicates.

2.1 Transcriptome analysis

Time—resolved gene expression microarrays from 16 published
(Andrews et al., 2010; Eckel—Mahan et al., 2013; Hughes et al.,
2009; Masri et al., 2014; Miller et al., 2007; Panda et al., 2002) and
2 unpublished experiments (Tognini et al., unpublished data) were
gathered for analysis. The datasets were downloaded from Circa
(Hughes et al., 2009) or GEO (Edgar et al., 2002) or provided by
the authors. The transcriptomes along with tissue (e.g. liver, muscle)
and condition (e.g. wild—type, knockout, high—fat diet) are listed in
Supplementary Table S1. To compare gene lists across different
microarray platforms/experiments, we used DAVID (Huang et al.,
2009, 2007) for all gene/transcript ID conversions.

2.2 Metabolome analysis

Time—resolved metabolite levels measured using LC/GC chromatog—
raphy were obtained from eight published (Dyar et al., 2014; Eckel—
Mahan et al., 2013; Masri et al., 2014) and two unpublished experi—
ments (Abbondante et al., unpublished data). The metabolomes
along with corresponding tissues and conditions are listed in
Supplementary Table S1. The unique compound identifier reported
by the Metabolon (Durham, NC) system was used to compare the
list of metabolites across the different experiments.

2.3 Circadian analysis

Gene expression and metabolite levels from all experimental datasets
were analyzed using JTK_CYCLE with typical default parameters.
JTK_CYCLE (Hughes et al., 2010) implements a nonparametric stat—
istical test which can be used to determine cycling events in gene ex—
pression and other time series. A gene was considered circadian, if at
least one of its transcripts was found to be circadian by JTK_CYCLE.
To correct for multiple testing, we use the Bonferroni—corrected P val—
ues produced by JTK_CYCLE (Supplementary). Furthermore, all ana—
lyses are conducted at three different cutoffs.

2.4 Creation and analysis of circadian networks

We constructed comprehensive networks maps using CircadiOmics
(Eckel—Mahan et al., 2012). The methods to build these networks are
described in detail in Patel et al. (2012). Brieﬂy, CircadiOmics com—
bines information about molecular species and their interactions from
several databases to provide information—rich and tissue—specific views
of the underlying networks in a circadian context. These networks in—
clude metabolic and enzymatic reactions, protein—protein interactions
and regulatory edges from MotifMap (Daily et al., 2011; Xie et al.,
2009) and published ChIP experiments, along with the time series
profiles available from the corresponding experimental data. Thus,
for instance, through CircadiOmics, we can investigate any particular
experiment to find out whether a transcription factor or enzyme has a

circadian expression profile or not and which of the genes or metabol—
ites it may control has a circadian profile or not.

3 Results

3.1 Comparison of transcriptomes

Analysis across different tissue types and conditions reveals surpris—
ingly little overlap between the molecular species that oscillate in
one tissue/condition versus another (Fig. 1) beyond the core clock
genes. The figure displays the matrix of the sizes of all pairwise
intersections of circadian genes across all experiments, color coded
so that darker colors correspond to larger intersections. When the
results of circadian experiments conducted over different tissues and

 

 

conditions (listed in Supplementary Table S1) are aggregated with a
stringent oscillatory cutoff (P < 0.05), over 13 600 genes are found
to oscillate in at least one tissue or condition in mouse. Thus, a sig—
nificant fraction (~68%) of the protein coding genes in a mamma—
lian genome is capable of generating mRNAs which oscillate in a
circadian fashion in at least one tissue or condition. At a more
stringent P—value cutoff of 0.01, we still find ~8650 genes
(Supplementary Fig. S2) exhibiting circadian oscillations in at least
one experiment. And at the even more stringent P—value cutoff of
0.005, we still find ~7877 genes (Supplementary Fig. S4) exhibiting
circadian oscillations in at least one experiment. These numbers are
likely to increase in the future as more tissues/conditions are studied
and aggregated. Even comparing transcriptomes from perturbation

experiments performed on the same tissue (liver, see Supplementary
Fig. S1) show that a major fraction of genes can produce circadian
transcripts under some condition in that tissue alone. Thus, tissue—
type, environmental, genetic and even diet perturbations all lead to
significant differences in the list of oscillating genes.

3.2 Comparison of metabolomes

Similar results are seen when time—dependent metabolite levels from
different tissues and conditions are aggregated (Fig. 2). The figure dis—
plays the matrix of the sizes of all pairwise intersections of circadian
metabolites. At a P—value cutoff of 0.05, out of the 554 measured
metabolites, we find 376 metabolites oscillating in a circadian manner
in at least one of the conditions. Hence, ~67% of the measured me—
tabolites oscillate even when using a relatively small set of tissue/condi—
tions. At a more stringent P—value cutoff of 0.01, we still find ~300
metabolites (Supplementary Fig. S3) exhibiting circadian oscillations
in at least one experiment. And at the even more stringent P—value cut—
off of 0.005 , we still find ~270 metabolites (Supplementary Fig. S5)
exhibiting circadian oscillations in at least one experiment.

Taken together, these results from across tissue and within tissue
comparisons establish that a significant fraction of transcripts and
metabolites is capable of circadian oscillations in at least one type of
tissue or condition. We hypothesize that similar results hold also for
protein levels, although systematic high—throughput circadian prote—
omic measurements are not yet available (see Section 4).

3.3 Circadian oscillations are plastic: effects of
perturbations

We observe that genetic or environmental perturbations tend to dis—
rupt circadian oscillations in given system in several ways. As ex—
pected, such perturbations can:

Fig. 2. Pain/vise comparison matrix across 10 metabolomic experiments. The
numbers correspond to the number of oscillating genes/metabolites (P3005)
that are common to both tissues/conditions (i.e. (A 0 Bl). The color intensity cor-
responds to the Tanimoto—Jaccard index (IA 0 Bl/IA U Bl). In total, there are 376
(~68%) measured metabolites that oscillate in at least one tissue or condition

' Change the phase of pre—existing circadian oscillations for some
of the molecular species;

' Disrupt or even suppress the pre—existing oscillations of some of
the molecular species.

Indeed, experiments involving genetic knockouts, diet changes or
even simply different mice strains, show these effects (Fig. 3). For in—
stance, when comparing gene expression in liver tissue from Clock
mutant and wild—type mice (Miller et al., 2007), ~1160 genes show
a loss of circadian rhythmicity. However, ~400 genes oscillate in
both conditions but with a difference in amplitude or phase
(Fig. 3A). Similarly, when comparing gene expression and metabol—
ite levels in liver tissue from 10—week high—fat—fed versus normal—
chow—fed mice (Eckel—Mahan et al., 2013), ~2200 genes and ~40
measured metabolites show a loss of circadian rhythmicity, whereas
~1520 genes and ~60 measured metabolites oscillate in both condi—
tions, but with a difference in amplitude or phase.
More importantly perhaps, perturbations can also:

' Create new circadian oscillations in many molecular species that
were not oscillating in the control case.

Unlike the changes above, the massive creation of new oscillations,
all at the same frequency, in such complex systems is puzzling and
requires further analysis and explanations (see also Section 4).

3.4 Emergence of new oscillations

When comparing liver samples from Clock mutant and wild—type mice
(Miller et al., 2007), ~240 genes oscillate in the mutants but not in the
controls (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, these new oscillations arise in spite of
mutating the Clock gene. Similarly, when comparing liver samples
from mice fed with high—fat chow versus normal—chow (Eckel—Mahan
et al., 2013), ~1110 genes and ~40 measured metabolites oscillate in
the high—fat but not in the normal—chow condition (Fig. 3B). Important
transcription factors, enzymes and metabolites are found among the
new oscillating species. For example, SREBF1 a key transcription fac—
tor regulating enzymes involved in lipid synthesis shows a new, robust
(P : 0.00001), circadian oscillation in the high—fat condition.

The pervasiveness and plasticity of circadian oscillations

3185

 

Remarkably, novel oscillations are also seen in data collected
from the same tissue of wild—type mice but corresponding to differ—
ent genetic strains. Specifically, a comparison of liver tissue from
C57BL/6] (Eckel—Mahan et al., 2013) and C57/B6 +Black Swiss
(Masri et al., 2014) mice strains uncovers ~2840 genes that oscillate
only in C57BL/6], ~890 genes that oscillate only in C57/B6 + Black
Swiss and ~900 genes that oscillate in both strains (Fig. 3C). This is
also true when comparing liver samples from two animals with a
slightly different mixture of C57/B6 and Black Swiss strains (see
Liver Sirtl WT and Liver Sirt6 WT in Fig. 1). Note that this may in
part also explain why differences in oscillatory behavior are seen in
assays that are presumed to be identical (e.g. ‘wild—type liver tissue’)
but in reality are not, due to significant differences between wild—
type strains (Yalcin et al., 2012) and the environments in which the
mice are raised. Even the concept of ‘normal chow’ is vague and can
differ substantially from one laboratory to another.

In aggregate, these results suggest that the physiological state of
a cell or a tissue is strongly characterized by its circadian profile, es—
sentially the list of molecular species that oscillate in a circadian
fashion and the characteristics of their oscillations (e.g. phases and
amplitudes). Furthermore, one can predict that any significant per—
turbation (genetic, epigenetic or environmental) will significantly
change this profile, by changing amplitudes and phases of existing
oscillations and by introducing novel oscillations.

3.5 Web server and visualization

All the transcriptome and metabolome data used in the analyses pre—
sented here have been imported into the CircadiOmics database and
web server (Patel et al., 2012) and can be analyzed and visualized
online at: http://circadiomics.igb.uci.edu. CircadiOmics produces
high—resolution biological networks displaying, for instance,

Clock-Bmall form Hum

metabolites, enzymes, transcription factors and their interactions
and concentration changes over time throughout the circadian cycle
(Fig. 4).

4 Discussion

Previous gene expression studies conducted with single conditions
have already revealed that a significant fraction of the transcriptome
can oscillated in a circadian fashion in simple organisms: a third of
the transcriptome in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Covington et
al., 2008; Harmer et al., 2000), 64% of the transcriptome in the
cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus (Vijayan et al., 2009) and
almost the entire transcriptome in the marine unicellular alga
Ostreococcus tauri (Monnier et al., 2010). In a recent independent
study conducted in 12 mouse organs, 43% of all protein coding
genes showed circadian rhythms in transcription somewhere in the
body (Zhang et al., 2014). Here, we have extended these studies by
aggregating and analyzing both high—throughput transcriptomic and
metabolomic data in a mammalian system over multiple tissues and
conditions, revealing that a large fraction of the molecular species in
a mouse cell/tissue is capable of circadian oscillations under at least
some set of conditions. Furthermore, while the experiments used
here were conducted using tissue preparations, it is reasonable to
infer that even more diversity in oscillations would be observed if
one were to aggregate experiments done at the level of single cells
both within tissues and across tissues, as well as many other condi—
tions. Thus, our results provide only lower bounds on the total num—
ber of transcripts or metabolites that could be found to oscillate in a
circadian manner under at least one set of conditions by the same
methods. Additional non—transcriptional circadian oscillations, for
instance, in the levels of post—translationally modified proteins, are

does not oscillate and will tend to converge to one of several fixed-point at-
tractors. (2) A cycle between four molecular species with an odd number of
negative interactions. Increasing the concentration of A, increases the con-
centration of B, which decreases the concentration of C, which decreases the
concentration of D, which then decreases the concentration of A. Thus such a
system will tend to oscillate. (3) Example of two interlocked cycles one of
length three and another of length four sharing one edge (between C and D)
with fixed-point attractors. Changing the sign of the shared interaction cre-
ates two oscillatory loops, exemplifying how a small change can have a large
effect

also known to exist (O’Neill et al., 2011; van Ooijen and Millar,
2012) leading us to conjecture that almost any molecular species in
the cell is potentially capable of circadian oscillations.

To better interpret these puzzling results, we brieﬂy develop a
coupled circadian—oscillators framework logically articulated around
four questions: (i) what are the oscillators? (ii) what are their periods?
(iii) how are they coupled? and (iv) what is the role of the clock?

4.1 Coupled circadian—oscillators framework

4.1.1 Molecular loops as oscillators

The first observation is that a transcript (or any other molecular spe—
cies) cannot oscillate in isolation. What really oscillate are entire
loops of interacting molecular species comprising different kinds of
interactions such as regulatory (transcriptional), protein—protein
and enzymatic interactions. Oscillatory loops typically contain an
odd number of negative interactions (Fig. 5). Biological network
contain a large number of such directed loops and thus many poten—
tial oscillators. For instance, in a network consisting of 21 826
genes/proteins with 120988 edges (114 493 regulatory edges and
6495 physical protein—protein interactions), we found over 3600
directed loops of size 3 and over 71 100 directed loops of size 4 (see
also Supplementary Table S3). These numbers are not meant to be
precise, as it is well known that there are several sources of noise in
reconstructed biological networks, but they are indicative of the gen—
eral trends and it is reasonable to estimate that the number of poten—
tial oscillators in the cell is in the 105 range.

4.1.2 Circadian periodicity

In the complex molecular circuitry of a cell, having many loops—and
thus many potential oscillators— does not explain why a large frac—
tion of them would oscillate with a circadian frequency. When a
complex physical system with many components is perturbed in
many different ways, one does not expect to see each time a different
subset of its component oscillating at the same constant frequency,
unless this frequency is deeply built—in into the system as a resonant
frequency. Indeed, high time resolution circadian data (Hughes et
al., 2009) show that most oscillating genes have a period of ~24 h,
with some genes oscillating at harmonic periods of about 12h and
8h. Very short periods (e.g. periodicity of one hour or less) and

periods not commensurate with the day—night cycle (e.g. periodicity
of 7h) are not observed as they are probably not physiological. The
key question then is why so many loops exhibit the same 24—h peri—
odicity? We believe evolution provides the answer to this question
as the world is drastically different during the day and the night, for
instance in terms of temperature, light, winds and predators. Thus
paying attention to these differences is likely to have conferred
major survival benefits to the corresponding organisms in the course
of evolution. It is important to note that some of the earliest unicel—
lular precursors of current living systems were highly circadian. For
example, Cyanobacteria which were present 3.4 billion years ago
are highly circadian (Vijayan et al., 2009) since they use photosyn—
thesis. Thus circadian oscillations at the molecular level were dis—
covered very early by evolution and subsequently refined and
propagated throughout the tree of life over two trillion day—night
cycles (Supplementary). Thus evolution has deeply sculpted the re—
lentless circadian rhythm into many of the molecular oscillators pre—
sent in each cell, so that the circadian frequency is the main resonant
frequency of these networks.

4.1.3 Coupling of the oscillators and cellular programming/
reprogramming

Armed with an understanding or what the oscillators are and why
they may have a built—in resonant period of 24 h, we can now con—
sider how these oscillators are coupled to each other and how biolo—
gical systems can manipulate the oscillatory landscape and its
couplings to adapt to internal or external perturbations.

Many different biological mechanisms couple these oscillators
together, but at the root of the coupling, there is always the sharing
of vertices (or even edges or paths) between oscillating loops form—
ing an intricate network of coupled circadian oscillators. The cou—
plings in such a network are likely to be non—linear, heterogeneous
and condition specific. Reprogramming at the cellular level
(Obviously reprogramming occurs at many levels and may involve,
for instance hormonal signals triggered by the SCN and cell—to—cell
communication within a tissue) occurs by (i) suppressing existing
molecular interactions thereby breaking loops; (ii) enabling new mo—
lecular interactions thereby creating new loops or (iii) changing the
sign of existing molecular interactions thereby modifying the oscilla—
tory behavior of existing loops.

There are several possible non—exclusive mechanisms by which
the cell can create, suppress or modify interactions between the dif—
ferent species to rapidly reprogram its oscillatory repertoire. For in—
stance, dynamic changes in the epigenome, like methylation,
acetylation and chromatin remodeling can play a central role in se—
lecting the fraction of oscillating species. An epigenetic modification
in the promoter of a gene can prevent the expression of a gene per—
manently, thus suppressing the oscillatory behavior of all the loops
containing the corresponding transcript or protein. Removing the
modification has the opposite effect. Recent studies have also identi—
fied circadian long—range interactions (Aguilar—Arnal et al., 2013)
and the role of CLOCK protein as a histone acetyltransferase (Doi et
al., 2006). Similarly, a post—translational modification may enable
the interaction of two proteins and thus the creation of correspond—
ing loops. Furthermore, nodes or edges associated with many loops
act as hubs that can couple and simultaneously inﬂuence many other
oscillators.

4.1.4 Role of molecular hubs and the clock
Molecular hubs associated with highly connected species usually af—
fect many oscillating loops and are capable of setting up cascades of

changes in amplitude, phase and oscillatory behavior. An example is
provided by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotideI, a metabolite that
participates in many reactions and plays a central role in regulating
circadian rhythms (Nakahata et al., 2008; Peek et al., 2013; Ramsey
et al., 2009). Not surprisingly, transcription factors also tend to be—
have like hubs, and the clock itself behaves as a central hub inter—
secting many loops and helping cellular reprogramming and the
selection of a significant fraction of which loops actually oscillate
under a given set of internal and external conditions (Fig. 4).

In particular, the main transcription factors in the clock, Clock
and Bmall, are densely connected (see Supplementary Tables S2
and S3). They are known to bind to a single or pair of E—box sites.
E—box sites are short (canonical sequence CACGTG) and frequent in
the genome (Fig. 6). With a stringent Bayesian Branch Length Score
(Xie et al., 2009) greater than 1, we found over 23 800 conserved
E—box sites in the mouse genome using MotifMap— several of which
are in the promoters of transcription factors. Using time—resolved
ChIP—seq data for BMAL1, Rey et al. (2011) identified 2049 E—box
binding sites in mouse liver. Among these, ~60% (1319) showed
a rhythmic binding of BMAL1 and 13% of all BMAL1 sites had a
pair of E—box elements with spacers of 6—7 base pairs. Thus, in
a given environment, cells can reveal or hide a fraction of E—box sites
thereby controlling which loops are directly, or indirectly, affected
and possibly entrained by Clock and Bmall.

To further understand the factors that confer to the cell its circa—
dian reprogramming capabilities, we analyzed the role of the core
clock genes in the context of the underlying global molecular net—
work. Using a network with regulatory and protein—protein inter—
action edges, we calculated the distance of all nodes from Clock or
Bmall and also the total number of directed loops that contain
Clock or Bmall. We found that ~10% of genes are one hop away
and ~60—70% genes are two hops away from Clock or Bmall (see
Supplementary Table S2). In addition, ~10% of genes are connected
to Clock or Bmall through a directed loop (see Supplementary
Table S3) of size 6 or less. In short, in this network of coupled oscil—
lators, Clock and Bmall form a central hub coupling and modulat—
ing many other circadian oscillators.

4.2 Formal models of coupled oscillators networks
Formal models of circadian oscillators and coupled oscillators (Baldi
and Meir, 1990; Brandt et al., 2006; Goel and Ermentrout, 2002;
Goldbeter, 1997; Strogatz, 2000) are brieﬂy discussed in
Supplementary Material.

4.3 Differential gene expression analysis

A simple consequence of having so many transcripts oscillating, or
with the potential for oscillating, is that some caution should be
exercised when drawing differential conclusions from gene expres—
sion experiments, especially when these are conducted at a single
time point, which is the majority of the cases. While one cannot

reasonably expect that all expression experiments be carried at mul—
tiple time points along the circadian cycle, it is clear that circadian
oscillations of transcripts can impact the lists of genes that appear to
be differentially expressed between two conditions and their
interpretation.

4.4 Conclusion

At the behavioral level, circadian rhythms are paradoxically both re—
lentless and ﬂexible. Relentless because they turn us into robots exe—
cuting the same routine every 24 hours. Flexible because this routine
is elastic and let us accommodate, for instance, an occasional early
meal or a late bedtime without suffering major consequences.
Remarkably, these paradoxical features of pervasiveness and plasti—
city are found at multiple levels of biological organization, including
tissues, cells and molecular networks as shown in this work.

Two trillion night—and—day cycles during the course of evolution
have deeply sculpted the molecular networks of the cell and made
24—h oscillations pervasive. Aggregation of high—throughput
transcriptomic and metabolomic experiments across tissue types and
conditions indeed reveal that a large fraction of the molecular net—
work of a cell is primed for and potentially capable of oscillating in a
circadian manner. In a given environment taken in its broadest sense
(to include for instance genetic modifications or inter—cell/inter—organ
communications), through epigenetic and other modifications, a cell
or tissue selects which fraction of molecular species out of its entire
repertoire exhibit circadian oscillations, including entirely novel oscil—
lations with respect to the corresponding control case.

Ongoing and future work should provide the data to better
model and understand networks of coupled—circadian oscillators,
predict how they respond to perturbations and use these responses
to explain biology and direct therapeutic intervention.

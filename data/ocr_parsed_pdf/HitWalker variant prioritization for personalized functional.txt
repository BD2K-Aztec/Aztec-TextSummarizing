ABSTRACT

Summary: Determining the functional relevance of identified se-
quence variants in cancer is a prerequisite to ultimately matching spe-
cific therapies with individual patients. This level of mechanistic
understanding requires integration of genomic information with com-
plementary functional analyses to identify oncogenic targets and relies
on the development of computational frameworks to aid in the priori-
tization and visualization of these diverse data types. In response to
this, we have developed HitWalker, which prioritizes patient variants
relative to their weighted proximity to functional assay results in a
protein—protein interaction network. It is highly extensible, allowing
incorporation of diverse data types to refine prioritization. In addition
to a ranked list of variants, we have also devised a simple shortest
path-based approach of visualizing the results in an intuitive manner to
provide biological interpretation.

example data are available as an R package from www.biodevlab.org/

1 INTRODUCTION

The advent of next-generation sequencing technology such as
that available from Illumina provides an unprecedented ability
to interrogate individual genomes (Metzker, 2010). Accompany-
ing technologies such as the ability to multiplex samples, as well
as efﬁcient sequence capture technologies (Ng et al., 2009) fur-
ther enable targeted regions of the genome to be re-sequenced at
a reasonable cost per sample. In this manner, speciﬁc genes or
whole exomes can be interrogated to identify variants potentially
having a deleterious impact on protein coding regions. Efﬁcacy
of this approach for clinical research has been shown through the
discovery of variants underlying simple Mendelian disorders, as
well as more complicated variants/mutations involved in cancer
and potentially complex traits (Kiezun et al., 2012). Because
many variants are produced for a given sample, mechanistic

and population genetic assumptions are often used to reduce
the set of variants (N g et al., 2009). For instance, limiting atten-
tion to non-synonymous single-nucleotide variations, as well as
using the use of variant databases, such as dbSNP (Sherry et al.,
2001) and the 1000 genomes project (The 1000 Genomes Project
Consortium, 2010), enables researchers to focus on low-
frequency variants that are potentially damaging. However,
even after these ﬁlters, it is relatively infrequent that a researcher
is left with a manageable set of variants for biological validation.

For cancer cells derived from a given patient, functional assays
can be performed that allow researchers to determine the rele-
vance of genes to cell viability, such as through the use of tar-
geted siRNA screens (Tyner et al., 2009). These gene targets can
be scored using a binary or quantitative encoding that indicates
outlier status relative to other samples. Similarly, screens that
measure the sensitivity of a patient’s cells to a panel of small
molecules can be scored relative to genes using the known gene
targets of each compound (Tyner et al., 2013). These functional
assays by themselves provide some information to researchers on
the identity of the signalling pathways that are required for
cancer growth and survival. However, they do not necessarily
indicate the mutated gene(s) leading to dysregulation of these
signalling pathways, as the true causative variant(s) could be
found in any gene with capacity to regulate the pathway.

To prioritize variants detected in our cohort of leukaemia pa-
tients relative to our functional assay results, we have devised the
R and SQL framework HitWalker using a proteiniprotein inter-
action (PPI) network as a backbone. In addition to a ranked list
of variants, HitWalker also allows for simple visualization of the
relevant subnetwork, as well as overlaying relevant meta-data.

2 DESCRIPTION OF SOFTWARE

2.1 Variant prioritization

Variants are related to genes implicated from the functional
assays through a user-defined PPI network, such as STRING
(Szklarczyk et al., 2011), which provides known and hypothetical
links between proteins that are weighted by a confidence score.
Variants and the functional assay results are mapped to the pro-
teins of the network using pre-supplied meta-data. For example,
variants can be mapped to transcripts, which in turn can be
mapped to proteins (as well as gene symbols). This hierarchy is

Fig. 1. Modiﬁed visualization output from HitWalker displaying the top
three assay hits (EPHA4, JAK3 and FRK) and variants (FLT3, ZAK
and PRKCE) for an acute myeloid leukaemia patient. Note that other
hits are pulled out and annotated, as they are on the shortest path. Gene
names are provided for each node. For nodes containing variants (blue),
frequency information is reported in terms of the patient cohort counts
(F), as well as the RWR rank (R). Red and green nodes indicate siRNA
and gene target hits, respectively. Dotted borders indicate absence of
capture probes for a given gene. Dashed borders indicate functional
assay targets whose inhibition did not signiﬁcantly alter cell viability.
Conﬁdence scores for the interactions between the two genes are reported
near the lines connecting two given genes

managed through the specification of ‘core’ or ‘summary’ IDs to
be used in the internal functions.

By default, prioritization is performed using a random walk
with restarts algorithm (RWR) (Kohler et al., 2008; Tong et al.,
2008). In HitWalker, RWR provides a measure of weighted
proximity between a set of proteins associated with functional
assay hits and a set of proteins containing variants. Variants are
prioritized based on the resulting RWR association score attrib-
uted to the protein. See the Supplementary Material for more
information. We note that any number of approaches related to
our RWR implementation could be easily applied as well, includ-
ing corrections for degree (Erten et al., 2011).

2.2 Visualization

The relevant subnetworks can be visualized by approximating
the RWR algorithm using the unweighted shortest paths between
the top queries and seeds. Shortest paths connecting the func-
tional hit and variant genes are also displayed for additional
context. For the shortest path calculations, the path with the
highest overall path score is chosen if multiple equivalent shortest
paths exist. The user can deﬁne functions mapping meta-data in
the database to attributes of the network. For instance, genes can
be represented using different shapes and colours. An example of
such a figure is shown in Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S1.
In a patient with acute myeloid leukaemia, an S451F amino acid
change in the FLT3 gene was the top ranking variant, which has
been previously characterized and catalogued in COSMIC
(Forbes et al., 2011). Non-synonymous single-nucleotide variants
in ZAK and PRKCE were the next highest-ranked variants, and

all three genes are candidates based on the observed drug
response.

3 DISCUSSION

Our software provides a ﬂexible framework for prioritizing vari-
ants relative to functional assay outcomes and a PPI network or
other association graph using an RWR algorithm. In addition,
we include visualization of key subnetwork members to aid in
biological interpretation. Prioritized variants can then be fol-
lowed up using Sanger sequencing, as well as additional experi-
ments to categorize their phenotypic effect. Software developers
can easily modify queries and R functions for their in-house
databases and functional assays. Although MySQL is our
database of choice, any other R/DBI-supported database
would work with minor modiﬁcations to the R code.

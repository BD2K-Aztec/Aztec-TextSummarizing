ABSTRACT

Summary: Here we introduce catRAPlD omics, a server for large-
scale calculations of protein—RNA interactions. Our web server
allows (i) predictions at proteomic and transcriptomic level; (ii) use of
protein and RNA sequences without size restriction; (iii) analysis of
nucleic acid binding regions in proteins; and (iv) detection of RNA
motifs involved in protein recognition.

Results: We developed a web sen/er to allow fast calculation of
ribonucleoprotein associations in Caenorhabditis elegans, Danio
rerio, Drosophi/a melanogaster, Homo sapiens, Mus musculus,
Rattus non/egicus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Xenopus tropicalis
(custom libraries can be also generated). The catRAPlD omics was
benchmarked on the recently published RNA interactomes of Serine/
arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1), Histone-lysine N-methyltrans-
ferase EZH2 (EZH2), TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (T DP43) and RNA-
binding protein FUS (FUS) as well as on the protein interactomes of
U1/U2 small nucleolar RNAs, X inactive specific transcript (Xist) repeat
A region (RepA) and Crumbs homolog 3 (CRB3) 3’-untranslated region
RNAs. Our predictions are highly significant (P < 0.05) and will help the
experimentalist to identify candidates for further validation.

1 INTRODUCTION

Increasing evidence indicates that ribonucleoprotein interactions
are fundamental for cellular regulation (Khalil and Rinn, 2011).
Moreover, several studies highlighted the involvement of RNA
molecules in the onset and progression of human diseases includ-
ing neurological disorders (Johnson et al., 2012). To our know-
ledge, there are two sequence-based methods for prediction of
proteineRNA interactions: catRAPID (Bellucci et al., 2011) and
RPISeq (Muppirala et al., 2011). The catRAPID algorithm
exploits predictions of secondary structure, hydrogen bonding
and van der Waals’ contributions to estimate the binding pro-
pensity of protein and RNA molecules. RPISeq is based on
support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF)

models predicting proteineRNA interactions from primary
structure alone (Muppirala et al., 2011). Both methods show
remarkable performances, but catRAPID discriminates posi-
tive and negative cases with higher accuracy (Cirillo et al.,
2013b) and has been tested on long non-coding RNAs
(Agostini et al., 2013).

Here we introduce catRAPID omics to perform high-through-
put predictions of proteineRNA interactions using the informa-
tion on protein and RNA domains involved in macromolecular
recognition.

2 WORKFLOW AND IMPLEMENTATION

The catRAPID omics server provides two main services to
explore the interaction potential of (i) a protein of interest with
respect to a target transcriptome or (ii) a given RNA with respect
to the nucleic acid binding proteome. Several options are avail-
able to refine the type of analysis in eight model organisms or
custom libraries (see online documentation):

0 In the case of a protein query, catRAPID omics takes as
input the protein sequence (FASTA format): full-length or,
alternatively, nucleic acid binding regions.

0 For a transcript query (FASTA format), the server uses the
full-length sequence if below 1200 nt, or, alternatively, uses
fragments with predicted stable secondary structure
(Agostini et al., 2013). Full-length proteins and nucleic
acid binding regions can be searched.

o The server automatically detects disordered proteins lacking
canonical RNA binding domains. Indeed, it has been
observed that disordered regions are enriched in RNA bind-
ing proteins (Castello et al., 2012).

c As RNA motifs are important for protein recognition
(Kazan et al., 2010), a search for these elements is carried
out. The motifs were taken from RNA-Binding Protein
DataBase (RBPDB) (Cook et al., 2011), SpliceAid—F
(Giulietti et al., 2013) and a recent motif compendium
(Ray et al., 2013).

0 Using the interaction propensities distribution, catRAPID
omics predicts the RNA binding ability of the input protein
(86% accuracy) and ranks RNA interactions (downloadable
by the user).

Fig. 1. catRAPID omics features and performances. (A) Example of the output table showing Z-score (interaction propensity normalized with respect to
experimental cases), discriminative power (with respect to training sets), interaction strength (enrichment with respect to random interactions) and
presence of RNA binding domains as well as RNA motifs. Interaction scores are ranked according to a ‘star rating systern’ ranging from 0 to 3 (http://
service.tartaglialab.com/static_ﬁ1es/shared/faqs.htm1). A click on the text redirects to reference pages. Performances on (B) full-length proteins and
(C) RNA binding protein domains. Gray is used to highlight transcriptomic studies (i.e. RNA sequencing) and red indicates proteomic analyses (i.e. mass
spectrometry). The signiﬁcance of our predictions was assessed using Fisher’s exact test (the dashed line corresponds to P: 0.05)

In the output page (Fig. 1A), we report all the variables used
to estimate proteineRNA associations: interaction propensity
(Bellucci et al., 2011), discriminative power (Bellucci et al.,
2011), interaction strength (Agostini et al., 2013) and presence
of protein RNA binding domains as well as RNA motifs. A ‘star
rating system’ ranks the binding propensities (http://service.tar
taglialab.com/static_ﬁ1es/shared/faqs.html). As for the reference
sets, ENSEMBL (version 68) is used for retrieval and classiﬁca-
tion of coding and non-coding RNAs, whereas protein sequences
are gathered from the UniProtKB database (release 2012_11).
Finally, catRAPID omics uses hmmscan, a Hidden Markov
Model-based algorithm from the HMMER3 package (Finn
et al., 2011), to identify known PfamA domains (Finn et al.,
2009) and recognize protein regions involved in binding nucleic
acid molecules. Algorithm hit signiﬁcance is determined accord-
ing to the PfamA ‘gathering thresholds’.

3 PERFORMANCES

The catRAPID algorithm has been previously validated on a
number of proteineRNA associations (Agostini et al., 2013;
Bellucci et al., 2011; Cirillo, et al., 2013a; Johnson et al., 2012).
To evaluate large-scale performances of catRAPID omics, we
used data from recent large-scale experiments. To compare pre-
dicted and experimental interactions, we used Fisher’s exact test.
As shown in Figure 1B, performances on the human splicing
factor serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSFl) (Sanford
et al., 2009) and murine nucleic acid binding protein Histone-
lysine N-methyltransferase EZH2 (EZH2) (Zhao et al., 2010) are
highly signiﬁcant (P—Values: 0.01 and 0.01, respectively). Good
performances are found for low-throughput experiments on
murine non-coding X inactive speciﬁc transcript (Xist) repeat
A region (RepA) (Maenner et al., 2010; Royce-Tolland et al.,
2010) and yeast small nuclear RNA U1 (CVitkovic and Jurica,
2012) (P—Values: 0.03 and 0.015) (Fig. 1B). To illustrate the abil-
ity of catRAPID omics to predict interactions with nucleic acid
binding domains (Fig. 1C), we used murine FUS (Han et al.,
2012) and rat TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43)
(Sephton et al., 2011) (P—Values: 3e-05 and 0.002) as well as
human Crumbs homolog 3 (CRB3) 3’-untrans1ated region
(Iioka et al., 2011) and yeast small nuclear U2 (CVitkovic and
Jurica, 2012) (P-Values: 0.001 and 2e-0.6). To evaluate
catRAPID’s performances on high-throughput data, we

collected positive interactions (TDP43: 568, FUS: 99, SRSFl:
358, EZH2: 1141) as well as negative controls (same numbers
as positives and generated in four random extractions).
Comparing the interaction scores of positives and negatives, we
found enrichment (calculated as discriminative power) in 72%
(TDP43), 88% (FUS), 74% (SRSFl) and 56% (EZH2) of cases.
On the same datasets, SVM RPIseq showed enrichment in 58%
(TDP43; RF has enrichment in 53%), 83% (FUS; RF has en-
richment in 68%), 47% (SRSFl; RF has enrichment in 59%)
and 41% (EZH2; RF has enrichment in 48%) of cases.

4 CONCLUSIONS

Despite recent technical developments, detection of proteine
RNA associations remains a challenging task. For this reason,
we developed an algorithm that can be used to complement
experimental efforts (Zanzoni et al., 2013). The catRAPID
omics server offers unique features such as organism-specific
proteomic and transcriptomic libraries, possibility to generate
custom datasets, analysis of long sequences and calculation of
interaction specificities. Moreover, we implemented an algorithm
for the detection of RNA motifs as well as protein RNA binding
domains, which will help to retrieve recognition motifs embedded
in sequences. Our server enables fast calculations of ribonucleo-
protein associations and predicts RNA binding activity of pro-
teins with high accuracy, thus resulting in a powerful tool for
designing new experiments.

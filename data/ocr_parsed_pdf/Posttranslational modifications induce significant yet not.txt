ABSTRACT

Motivation: A number of studies of individual proteins have shown
that post-translational modifications (PTMs) are associated with struc-
tural rearrangements of their target proteins. Although such studies
provide critical insights into the mechanics behind the dynamic regu-
lation of protein function, they usually feature examples with relatively
large conformational changes. However, with the steady growth of
Protein Data Bank (PDB) and available PTM sites, it is now possible
to more systematically characterize the role of PTMs as conform-
ational switches. In this study, we ask (1) what is the expected
extent of structural change upon PTM, (2) how often are those
changes in fact substantial, (3) whether the structural impact is spa-
tially localized or global and (4) whether different PTMs have different
signatures.

Results: We exploit redundancy in PDB and, using root-mean-square
deviation, study the conformational heterogeneity of groups of protein
structures corresponding to identical sequences in their unmodified
and modified forms. We primarily focus on the two most abundant
PTMs in PDB, glycosylation and phosphorylation, but show that
acetylation and methylation have similar tendencies. Our results pro-
vide evidence that PTMs induce conformational changes at both local
and global level. However, the proportion of large changes is unex-
pectedly small; only 7% of glycosylated and 13% of phosphorylated
proteins undergo global changes >2 A. Further analysis suggests that
phosphorylation stabilizes protein structure by reducing global con-
formational heterogeneity by 25%. Overall, these results suggest a
subtle but common role of allostery in the mechanisms through
which PTMs affect regulatory and signaling pathways.

1 INTRODUCTION

Post-translational modiﬁcations (PTMs) refer to in vi v0 biochem-
ical processing events of a protein after its synthesis (Walsh,
2006). It is speculated that nearly every protein undergoes
some form of PTM (Lodish, 2004) and >400 types of PTMs
have been reported so far, spanning all domains of life.
Different PTMs display different physicochemical properties
(Mann and Jensen, 2003); thus, the same protein may exhibit
different functions upon different modiﬁcations (Jungblut

et al., 2008). As a result, the high diversity of PTMs, combined
with their reversibility and enzymatic control, makes them a Vital
component of molecular recognition, signal transduction and
protein degradation (Deribe et al., 2010; Uy and Wold, 1977;
Walsh et al., 2005; Wold, 1981). Dysregulation of PTMs and
mutation of PTM sites are implicated in a number of diseases
(Vidal, 2011), from various monogenic disorders (Li et al., 2010)
to complex diseases such as cancer (Bode and Dong, 2004;
Krueger and Srivastava, 2006; Radivojac et al., 2008), heart dis-
ease (Van Eyk, 2011) and neurodegenerative disorders (Gong
et al., 2005; Thomas et al., 2004).

The mechanisms through which PTMs regulate protein func-
tion are of great interest to biologists. Most PTM events intro-
duce additional chemical groups to residue side chains with the
potential to alter the energy landscape of a protein and subse-
quently lead to conformational changes observed in crystal struc-
tures. Various examples have shown that this structural change is
essential for the modified protein to display new functionalities
as in the case of phosphorylation (Blasie et al., 1990; Edreira
et al., 2009; Giannopoulos et al., 2009; Lee and Koland, 2005;
Menet and Rosbash, 2011), glycosylation (Arnold et al., 2007),
acetylation (Gu and Roeder, 1997) and sumoylation
(Geiss-Friedlander and Melchior, 2007). Additional mechanisms
include change of binding affinity or creation of binding sites
(Deribe et al., 2010; Nishi et al., 2011; Schaller and Parsons,
1995; Toh et al., 2001).

The most extensively studied PTM is phosphorylation that,
with some exceptions, adds a phosphoryl group to serine, threo-
nine or tyrosine residues in eukaryotes and to histidine or aspar-
tic acid residues in prokaryotes. The phosphoryl group has a
double negative charge under physiological conditions and is
anticipated to affect the energy landscape of the modiﬁed protein
(Stock and Da Re, 2000). In their review, Johnson and Lewis
(2001) analyzed 17 pairs of phosphorylated and non-phosphory-
lated structures to characterize the structural consequences of
phosphorylation. They showed that the dominant structural re-
sponse was an adjustment of protein conformation to accommo-
date for the electrostatic effects between the phosphate and
surrounding charged atoms. However, the types and extent of
structural changes were highly diverse: they observed both local
and long-range changes; both association and disassociation of
protein complexes and both order-to-disorder and disorder-to-
order transitions. In one extreme case, phosphorylation of Ser14
in glycogen phosphorylase results in a 50A shift of Ser14 itself.
In addition, this phosphorylation event alters the tertiary struc-
ture of enzyme’s catalytic site that is around 50A away from
Ser14. However, there are also situations in which

phosphorylation and other PTMs introduce no detectable con-
formational change. We found multiple such cases in this study;
for example, Pseudomonas putida benzoylformate decarboxylase
(lbfdA is phosphorylated; 3fst is not); Zea mays polyamine
oxidase (1b37C is glycosylated; 1h83C is not) or human lysine
methyltransferase SET7 (2f69B is methylated; 3m59B is not).
In each of these cases, the global root mean-square deviation
(RMSD) between two structures was 50.13A and the local
RMSD, within 6A of the modiﬁcation site, was 50.05

In addition to the analysis of experimentally determined struc-
tures, computational approaches have also been explored
(Narayanan and Jacobson, 2009). Common strategies include
molecular dynamics and conformational sampling. However,
both of these strategies are limited by several factors, including
computational requirements necessary for modeling micro- to
millisecond events on large molecules, assumptions on the scale
of conformational change or inﬂuence of a particular force field
(Lwin and Luo, 2006; Narayanan and Jacobson, 2009). Recent
studies have tested the accuracy of computational models by
predicting the structure of the phosphorylated molecule based
on the structure of the unmodiﬁed molecule and then comparing
the predicted with the actual phosphorylated structure (Groban
et al., 2006; Shen et al., 2005). The results of these and other
studies (Latzer et al., 2008) suggest that such methods may be
accurate enough to provide valuable insights into the structure
function relationship.

Despite the recent progress in understanding the structural
impact of PTMs, much of the focus has been on individual pro-
teins. However, with the rapid growth of protein structure data
as well as the presence of multiple structures corresponding to
the same amino acid sequence, larger scale studies focused on
characterizing the overall trends of the structural impact are
becoming realistic. This is further facilitated by the results of
recent work in which multiple X-ray structures of the same pro-
tein in Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Berman et al., 2000) were
reported to be similar to those observed in solution using nuclear
magnetic resonance (Lange et al., 2008), suggesting that different
X-ray structures of the same protein can in principle be used to
study and understand protein conformational flexibility.

In this study, we systematically analyze groups of protein
structures (corresponding to the same sequence) in their modiﬁed
and unmodified forms to address questions regarding the

universality, extent and signatures of structural changes upon
PTM. Our work provides evidence that PTMs, similar to
ligand binding, induce generally small but statistically significant
conformational changes.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data collection and experimental protocol

Protein structures and sequences corresponding to the SEQRES ﬁelds
were obtained from PDB. RNA, DNA and ligand sequences were dis-
carded and only polypeptide sequences were retained. CD-HIT (Yang
et al., 2010), which can cluster a sequence database at a given sequence
identity threshold, was used to form clusters of PDB chains correspond-
ing to identical sequences. Only clusters with two chains or more were
kept. We then examined corresponding PDB ﬁles to ﬁnd clusters in which
chains had different MODRES proﬁles.

We analyzed four PTMs in this study: glycosylation, phosphorylation,
acetylation and methylation. Regular expression patterns ‘GLYCO’,
‘PHOSPHO’, ‘ACETYL’ and ‘METHYL’ were used to retrieve clusters
that may contain any of the PTM types. Then, the chemical component
dictionary from PDB was consulted to retain proteins with appropri-
ate modiﬁcation descriptors (the list of descriptors is shown in
Supplementary Table S1). Only protein structures with resolution
52.5A and R-value 50.3 were retained. The ﬁnal dataset contained
276 clusters, each with at least one modiﬁed and one unmodiﬁed struc-
ture; see Table 1 for a detailed breakdown. The average sequence identity
between clusters was 19.2% (median was 18.6%), and the average
number of structures for each cluster was 7.9 (median was 4). The ex-
perimental protocol is illustrated in Figure 1.

2.2 Calculation of RMSD, hydrogen bonds, crystal
contacts and salt bridges

Although all PDB chains in a CD-HIT cluster had the same amino acid
sequence, calculating the RMSD between pairs was not straightforward
because missing residues in the corresponding 3D coordinate (ATOM)
ﬁelds led to situations in which two structures were not directly superim-
posable. We established residue correspondences in each pair of struc-
tures by performing a global alignment between the two sequences
concatenated from the 3D coordinate ﬁelds, allowing for gaps but not
for mismatches. Then, a least-squares ﬁtting of aligned amino acids was
used to calculate the RMSD. Only Cor atoms were used for RMSD
calculations.

Local structural environments were deﬁned as concentric shells using
radii 6, 12, 18 and 24A from a PTM site or its counterpart in an

Fig. 1. Experimental procedure for collecting RMSD data for statistical analysis. Considering a protein cluster with m = 3 modiﬁed and n = 4 unmodi-
ﬁed structures, we deﬁne the between-group RMSD (RMSDu’m), where RMSD,-j is the RMSD between i-th modiﬁed structure and j—th unmodiﬁed
structure. The two within-group RMSDs, RMSD’" and RMSD“, were calculated separately on the sets of modiﬁed and unmodiﬁed structures. The two
within-group RMSDs and one between-group RMSD were collected for each PTM site in a cluster and were then subject to a paired t-test to explore
whether the between-group RMSD is signiﬁcantly greater than the within-group RSMD corresponding to the unmodiﬁed structures, i.e. to test whether
PTMs signiﬁcantly change protein structure. In these experiments, any situation in which the between-group RMSD was greater than the within-group
RMSD (i.e. RMSDu’m >RMSD“) was interpreted as structural change upon modiﬁcation. On the other hand, comparisons between RMSD“ and
RMSD’" were used to suggest potential stabilizing or destabilizing effect upon modiﬁcation. For example, if the conformational heterogeneity upon
modiﬁcation increases, a particular modiﬁcation event has destabilized the protein, which could then be supported by the fact that RMSD’” > RMSD“

unmodiﬁed chain (the average longest distance between any two Cor
atoms of the protein structures involved in this study was 62A). Local
RMSD was calculated in a similar way as global RMSD but only
included amino acids within the local environment distance cutoffs.

Hydrogen bonds were calculated using HBPLUS (McDonald and
Thornton, 1994), but the bonds between main chain atoms and water
molecules were excluded since they were not expected to contribute to a
change in the number of hydrogen bonds when modiﬁed and unmodiﬁed
chains were compared. Crystal contacts were calculated using CryCo
(Eyal et al., 2005) with a default threshold distance of 10 A salt
bridge was reported when a positively charged atom was within 4A of
a negatively charged atom.

2.3 Statistical analysis

The paired t-test was used for hypothesis testing, with the signiﬁcance level
set to 0.05. Generalized linear model (GLM) ﬁtting was used to explore the
inﬂuence of various parameters on the structural effects upon PTM. We
brieﬂy summarize the GLM framework below (Agresti, 2007).

GLM is a generalization of the standard linear model in which the
target variable y is modeled as a linear combination of the predictor
variables (features) x1, x2, . . . , x", that is y = a0 + alxl + azxz + . . . +
anxn + e, where (new, 1,") are real valued coefﬁcients and e is a stochastic
error term modeled using a normal distribution N(0, 02). In GLM, the
target variable is modeled as y = g(a0 + alxl + azxz + . . . + anxn + e),

where the inverse function of g(), f(), is called the link function.
The GLM can be re-written using the link function as
f(E[y]) = a0 + alxl + azxz + . . . + anxn, where E[y] is the expectation
of y. GLM provides a convenient mechanism to model the error using
distributions other than normal (e.g. a binomial distribution is used in
logistic regression). An identity link function reduces GLM to a standard
linear regression model in which e:./\/(0, 02).

The quality of the ﬁt is tested using deviance, deﬁned as
D = —2(log(L) — log(L0)), where L is the likelihood for the ﬁtted model
and L0 is the likelihood for the full model which is a strict memorization of
each data point (Agresti, 2007). Deviance can be viewed as a log-likelihood
ratio statistic and thus it approximately follows a X2 distribution with the
degree of freedom equaling the number of data points minus the number
of parameters in the model. Deviance can be used to calculate P-values in
order to evaluate goodness-of-ﬁt. Small P-values indicate poor ﬁts,
whereas ones that are not very small indicate adequate ﬁts.

In our experiments, we seek to understand which predictor variables
contribute to the observed difference between modiﬁed and unmodiﬁed
structures within the same CD-HIT cluster (recall that all structures in a
cluster correspond to the same amino acid sequence). To accomplish this,
we used a vector-space representation in which each data point pertained
to either one cluster (in calculations of global structural changes) or one
PTM site (in calculations of local structural changes). The predictor vari-
ables included the following: (1) the difference between the indicator vari-
ables between modiﬁed and unmodiﬁed chains; since we compare a group
of modiﬁed with a group of unmodiﬁed structures within a cluster, this
value will be 1 for all data points (x1 = 1); (2) the difference between the
average number of crystal contacts in two groups (x2); (3) the difference
between the average number of chains in protein complex for two groups
(x3); (4) the difference between the average protein crystallization tem-
perature (x4); (5) the difference between the average pH (x5); (6) the
difference between the average protein structure resolutions (x6) and (7)
the difference between the average number of ligands in the protein com-
plex (x7).

Two target variables were used for the GLM ﬁtting: (1)
y = log(RMSDV) — log(RMSD“) and (2) y = RMSDV — RMSD“; and
the one with the better ﬁt was selected. Here, RMSDV represents
RMSDu’m in each analysis of structural change upon modiﬁcation and
RMSD’" in the analysis of stabilization or destabilization of protein struc-
ture. Both types of ﬁtting enable estimating the expected extent of struc-
tural change upon modiﬁcation as follows.

Let us first consider a situation where the target variable is deﬁned
as y = log(RMSDV) — log(RMSD“). Suppose that the ﬁrst predictor
variable is non-zero (i.e. x1 = 1, with the regression coefficient a1),
while the remaining variables all equal to zero
(x2 = x3 = . . . = x7 = 0), meaning that only PTM conditions are differ-
ent between the two structure subgroups.

Since the identity link function assumes a normally distributed noise
variable, the target can be expressed as

1 (RMSDV

 

g RMSD“) Z “1 + “2’

where a1 is the expectation of the target, a is the standard deviation of the
noise variable and Z is a standard normal variable. Both a1 and a can be
estimated via the GLM ﬁtting (Agresti, 2007). A normally distributed
target y : N(a1, 02) means that a transformed random variable ey follows
a log-normal distribution, i.e.

RSMDV _
RSMD“ _
Because the expectation of ey equals emﬁi, the structural change
upon PTM can be calculated as
RMSDV — RMSD“
RMSD“

m +aZ

a+ﬁ
=e' 2—1.

If the target variable is y = RMSD’” — RMSD“, instead of the relative
difference, we can only report the expected absolute structural difference,
which equals m.

It is important to note that because of the inﬂuence of other variables
such as pH or temperature, the structural change due to PTM cannot be
directly calculated from data as an average of the observed structural
differences. Therefore, in cases when the ﬁtting is adequate, the regression
step estimates the proportion of the structural impact that can be attrib-
uted to the ﬁrst predictor variable (x1).

3 RESULTS

The major goal of this study was to quantify the expected struc-
tural difference between unmodiﬁed and post-translationally
modiﬁed proteins and thus understand the allosteric potential
of PTMs. We exploited the presence of multiple structures with
identical amino acid sequence in PDB that provided us with a
means to approximate conformational ﬂexibility of each protein
(Lange et al., 2008). In order to work with a sufﬁcient number of
structures, we focused on the four most abundant PTM types in
PDB: glycosylation, phosphorylation, acetylation and methyla-
tion. Because the datasets for acetylation and methylation were
too small to carry out a reliable statistical analysis, our main
focus was on glycosylation and phosphorylation.

3.1 PTMs signiﬁcantly change protein local structure

We first asked to what extent the additional chemical group, or a
polysaccharide molecule, impacts the local structural neighbor-
hood around a PTM site. To understand this, for each PTM site,
we studied the average RMSD between sets of modified and
unmodiﬁed structures (RMSDu’m) and how it relates to the
RMSDs calculated on structures within each group (modiﬁed
or unmodified). We then tested the hypothesis that PTMs sig-
niﬁcantly alter protein structure. Note that by using this ap-
proach, we compared RMSDs calculated on structures with
similar number of atoms, as suggested previously by
Gutteridge and Thornton (2005).

We studied local RMSD in four concentric shells deﬁned by
the distance (d) from the PTM site and only residues whose Cu
atoms were within the shell were included in the RMSD calcu-
lation. We compared the within-group RMSD and between-
group RMSD for each local environment using a one-tailed
paired t—test with the null hypothesis that the within-group and
between-group RMSDs are identical and the alternative hypoth-
esis that between-group RMSD is larger than within-group
RMSD. The percentage of clusters for which RMSD“””>
RMSD", shown in Table 2, indicates preferences of all four
PTMs for local structural re-arrangements. The P—Values
shown in Table 3 provide statistical support that glycosylation
and phosphorylation affect protein local structure in all three
layers when d > 6. The results are not significant for the d 5 6
layer probably because there are on average <6 amino acids in
this layer. Although few tests for methylation and acetylation
suggest signiﬁcant structural changes, potentially due to a
small sample size (10 sites for methylation and 13 for acetyl-
ation), the results show a similar trend as those for glycosylation
and phosphorylation. This is suggested by the observation that
the majority of the cases have RMSDu’m larger than RMSD“.
Supplementary Figure Sl shows the distributions of all RMSDs

vironments have similar distributions; Supplementary Table S2).

Previous studies suggested that crystallization conditions, pro-
tein complex formation and crystal packing may inﬂuence pro-
tein structure (Mohan et al., 2009; Palaninathan et al., 2008) and
result in a difference between protein crystal structure and its
structure in vivo (Eyal et al., 2005). We therefore explored the
GLM ﬁtting to seek explanatory variables associated with struc-
tural changes. It can be observed from Table 4 that ﬁtting was
adequate (large P—Values for the goodness of fit). Furthermore,
the P—Values of coefﬁcients for PTM were significant for both
glycosylation and phosphorylation as well as for the four PTM
types together. Although some other factors also inﬂuenced the
ﬁt, PTM was a contributing factor explaining the observed struc-
tural change. The results suggest that glycosylation on average
increases local RMSD (d 5 6 A) by 0.074 A, while phosphoryl-
ation increases it by 0.651  Note that each of the statistical tests
shown in Table 3 was performed on a separate dataset and thus
does not require correction for multiple hypothesis testing.
Similarly, the GLM ﬁtting in Table 4 was run to test the hypoth-
esis that a particular PTM is a signiﬁcant explanatory variable
for the observed change in structure, as opposed to a ‘discovery
mode’ in which one seeks to identify and report any subset of
explanatory variables for a particular phenomenon.

An interesting question arises regarding the percentage of
cases with large conformational changes upon PTM. We find
that changes >0.5A occur in 8.1% and 20.0% of cases for gly-
cosylation and phosphorylation, respectively. Similar percent-
ages were also observed for acetylation and methylation.

3.2 PTMs signiﬁcantly change protein global structure

We next investigated whether PTMs induce structural change
at a global protein level. Although our general approach is
similar to that in Section 3.1, in this case all comparisons
were carried out at the level of unique protein chains instead
of at the level of PTM sites. Thus, some of the protein struc-
tures unavoidably contained more than one modiﬁed residue.
As shown in Table 1, the data contained 121 protein chains
(clusters) for glycosylation (236 sites), 54 chains for phosphor-
ylation (55 sites), 14 chains for acetylation (13) and 13 for
methylation (10).

Analyses and statistical tests summarized in Tables 578 pro-
vide evidence that PTMs signiﬁcantly change protein structure at
the global level for both glycosylation (P = 5.7 x 104) and
phosphorylation (P = 4.0 x 103) compared with the unmodi-
ﬁed structures. In addition, observed structural changes are
strongly related to PTM rather than any other factor. As
shown in Table 7, large P—Values for GLM fitting suggest ad-
equate linear fitting and signiﬁcant P-Values for the coefﬁcient of
PTM but not any other explanatory factor (4.0 x 10’4 and
8.8 x 10’7 for glycosylation and all four PTMs together). The
P—Value of the PTM coefﬁcient for phosphorylation was not
signiﬁcant at a 0.05 level but it was considerably smaller than
P—Values for any other factor (Table 7), suggesting the need for
more data (there were only 54 data points for phosphorylation).
Coefficients of GLM ﬁtting suggest that glycosylation on aver-
age increases protein global structure RMSD by 69.7%
(a1 = 0.336, a = 0.621). Similarly, phosphorylation increases
global RMSD by 122.6% (a1 = 0.421,a = 0.871).

In terms of extreme changes, structural changes >2A were
observed in only 13.0% and 6.6% of cases for phosphorylation
and glycosylation, respectively. These results were similar for
acetylation and methylation and were consistent with those
observed at the local structure level.

3.3 Phosphorylation stabilizes protein structure at
a global level

When comparing within-group RMSDs and between-group
RMSDs, we compared RMSD’" and RMSD“ with RMSDu’m
separately and found similar results. In order to understand the
conformational ﬂexibility between unmodiﬁed and modiﬁed
forms of the proteins, we next studied the difference between
RMSD’" and RMSD“. The results of this analysis are shown
in Supplementary Figures SI and S2 and Tables 578.

The distributions of the two within-group RMSDs show a
similar trend observed in the comparison between within-group
and between-group RMSDs (Supplementary Figs SI and S2).
The distributions of RMSD“ shift toward the right-hand side

global levels, suggesting that PTMs might be able to reduce in-
ternal structural movements and thus stabilize protein structures.
GLM ﬁtting was performed on those signiﬁcant comparisons to
explore whether PTM was the main explanatory variable. For
local RMSDs, the significant explanatory factors include the
number of crystal contacts and crystallographic resolution,
whereas the presence of a PTM was not signiﬁcant. For global
RMSD of phosphorylation, PTM was signiﬁcant (P:0.036),
along with temperature (P:0.036) and resolution (P:0.017),
suggesting that phosphorylation signiﬁcantly stabilizes protein
structure. The correlation between the temperature value, reso-
lution and RMSD suggest that both larger difference in crystal-
lographic resolution and larger temperature difference result in
larger RMSD difference. The coefﬁcient of PTM from GLM
fitting results provides evidence that on average phosphorylation
reduces the global structural difference between two proteins by
25.2% (a1 = —0.696, a = 0.900).

To explore the mechanism of PTM-induced structural
changes, we analyzed the change in hydrogen bonds and the
number of salt bridges between modiﬁed and unmodified struc-
tures. For both glycosylation and phosphorylation, we observed
a signiﬁcant increase in the number of hydrogen bonds in the
local environment (P: 1.57 x 10’4 and 7.84 x 10’5 for d5 6A).
The analysis of salt bridges showed that the phosphoryl group
introduced new salt bridges in 45 of 70 protein structures (64.3%;
P = 0.03 6).

4 DISCUSSION

Although the importance of PTMs as functional modulators
has been established, the mechanisms through which most of
the regulation is carried out are still not well understood
(Walsh, 2006). In this study, we investigated the potential for
allosteric regulation in PTM-mediated functional changes by
quantifying structural impact upon PTM (allosteric effect is usu-
ally seen as a speciﬁc form of structural change in which binding
of an effector molecule at one site in a protein alters the local
structure around a functional site elsewhere in the protein, thus

affecting overall protein activity; Swain and Gierasch, 2006). Our
results provide quantitative evidence that PTMs induce signiﬁ-
cant conformational changes to protein structure and suggest
that PTMs act in similar ways as small-molecule allosteric
effectors.

We investigated four PTMs, glycosylation, phosphorylation,
methylation and acetylation, and showed that all exhibit similar
effects in local (Tables 24) and global (Tables $8) conform-
ational changes. In addition, phosphorylation has showed an
effect of stabilizing protein structure by introducing new hydro-
gen bonds and salt bridges in the local neighborhood of the
modiﬁed residue. Putting these results together, we speculate
that the predominant mechanism of PTM action is alteration
of the energy landscape, as shown in Figure 2. Speciﬁcally, we
believe that glycosylation and phosphorylation frequently lead to
a conformational shift of the lowest valley in the energy land-
scape; however, while glycosylation likely retains the approxi-
mate abundance of the conformation with the lowest energy,
phosphorylation results in an enriched abundance in the lowest
energy form thus restricting conformational ﬂexibility. Similar
conclusion has been speculated for intrinsically disordered pro-
teins (Ma and Nussinov, 2009). For phosphorylation, the stabi-
lizing effects might be a driving force to populate protein
conformations to a new state, which has been suggested for
ligand binding (Hilser, 2010). Conformational changes were
also found in methylation and acetylation; however, due to the

problems of dataset size, only glycosylation and phosphorylation
showed statistically significant differences in most experiments.

Although these results suggest preferences among PTMs for
conformational shifts, only a small fraction of structures go
through extreme changes. At a global level, glycosylation and
phosphorylation introduce structural changes >2A in only
743% of cases. These results are similar to those observed for
ligand binding where 9% of enzymes showed >2A structural
changes (Gutteridge and Thornton, 2005). These results strongly
suggest that despite the importance of structural change for the
modiﬁed protein to modulate its function, small-to-moderate
structural changes are usually sufﬁcient.

Experiments in this study were carried out with strict controls.
We only compared conformational heterogeneity between
(groups of) protein structures corresponding to identical amino
acid sequences. Although such a requirement greatly reduced the
number of data points that can be used for statistical analyses
(one data point per sequence cluster or PTM site), the approach
was necessary since absolute RMSD values are not directly com-
parable when calculated on very different numbers of atoms. In
addition, since RMSDs were calculated using Cot atoms only,
side-chain alterations that may also be critical for protein func-
tion (Lee et al., 2008) could not be observed. We believe this
resulted in more conservative estimation of the prevalence of
structural change (note that allostery may occur without any
observable backbone changes; Tsai et al., 2008). Another
reason that the estimates of conformational changes may be con-
servative is the inﬂuence of the expression system when studying
PTMs. In particular, non-observed N—linked glycosylation sites
expressed in eukaryotic systems may still be glycosylated in
the protein, but with the polysaccharide molecule missing from
the structural model due to static disorder (Rhodes, 2006). On
the other hand, proteins expressed in bacterial systems would be
less likely to include such problems.

A potential limitation of this study stems from the suitability of
crystallographic data for the study of conformational changes as
well as the assumptions used in our statistical analysis. Although
crystallographic data are generally reliable, its limitations are
related to the inherent biases in PDB (Peng et al., 2004) and its
ability to provide high-resolution insight into conformational
ﬂexibility of macromolecules. For example, PTMs that increase
ﬂexibility of protein regions leading to order-to—disorder transi-
tion could not be analyzed in this study. Statistically, one limita-
tion stems from GLM fitting where we included seven variables
that are believed to be the most important factors leading to
observed structural differences. However, other factors may also
exist as well as an interplay between them. For example, a PTM
can lead to protein complex formation (Nishi et al., 201 1), while in
the GLM fitting they would be considered as independent events.
Another limitation comes from the fact that a large enough data-
set could not be collected to investigate the inﬂuence of modifica-
tions of different amino acid residue types. As the size of PDB
increases, it will become possible to further reﬁne the analysis.

It is important to mention that PTMs have also been linked to
intrinsically disordered protein regions, i.e. regions without a
single dominant conformational macro-state under physiological
conditions (Radivojac et al., 2007). For example, phosphoryl-
ation, ubiquitination, methylation and others have been asso-
ciated to disordered regions either statistically (Daily et al.,

2005; Iakoucheva et al., 2004; Radivojac et al., 2010; Xie et al.,
2007) or experimentally (Collins et al., 2008; Gsponer et al.,
2008). Although such associations are certainly useful for our
understanding of the mechanisms underlying PTM regulation
and signaling, a large number of proteins do contain PTM
sites in their structured regions. Therefore, the results obtained
through our experiments are of broad importance.

Finally, in this work we provide evidence that the observed
differences between modiﬁed and unmodiﬁed structures are sig-
niﬁcant and can be attributed to PTM. However, the available
data do not contain intermediate structures that lead from one
observed conformation to another. Thus, the structural differ-
ences between modiﬁed and unmodiﬁed structures could be ex-
plained equally well by two alternative mechanisms: structural
change upon modiﬁcation and conformational selection from a
pre-existing structural ensemble (our preliminary analyses sug-
gest that both may be at play). Regardless of the underlying
mechanism, PTMs are associated with small but common con-
formational changes of their target proteins.

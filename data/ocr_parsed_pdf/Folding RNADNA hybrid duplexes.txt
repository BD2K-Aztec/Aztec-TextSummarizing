Fig. 1. Using hybrid instead of RNA parameters leads to very different structure prediction as summarized in a boxplot of the tree edit distances (A) for
all interactions between ANRIL and a putative target region at human chr l, 36 269 747 to 36 272 043 (hgl9). (B—D) Predicted secondary structures for
one example binding site (light: ANRIL), (B) DNA parameters, (C) RNA parameters and (D) mixed parameters

parameters (Supplementary Fig. S1), so we simply use the aver—
age of RNA and DNA ER/D = (ER+ED)/2 for all missing
values. We are aware that this formula gives an at best crude
approximation of the actual folding energies, but note that new
parameters can easily be incorporated. We hope that the
availability of prediction tools for RNA/DNA hetero—dimers
will encourage experimentalists to provide the missing energy
parameters.

2.3 Inclusion into the ViennaRNA package

Our approach to just adapt the energy computations enabled us
to easily include the RNA/DNA hetero—dimer support into all
parts of the ViennaRNA Package that compute dimer struc—
tures, namely, RNAco fold (Bernhart et al, 2006),
RNAup (Muckstein et al, 2008) and RNAduplex (Tafer and
Hofacker, 2008). RNA/DNA hetero—dimers are supported for
both the minimum free energy as well as the partition
function—based calculations. Furthermore, all programs can
read in user—supplied energy parameters. In particular, this
allows to make immediate use of any newly determined param—
eters for mixed RNAiDNA loops, or enables scientists to easily
evaluate different energy models as soon as sufficient RNA/
DNA structure data are available.

3 RESULTS

In the absence of programs that can deal with RNA/DNA
dimers, researchers have resorted to simply treating both parts
of the dimer as RNA. To test the effect of applying the right
(DNA or RNA) parameters to the single molecules and using
explicit RNA/DNA interactions, we chose ANRIL, a long
non—coding RNA that is suspected to have a DNA target
sequence, and one of its putative targets. In order to simulate
the size of the transcription bubble, we chose a sliding window
approach with DNA pieces of length 50, step size 25 for our
computations. Even though ANRIL (1500 nt) is much longer
than the pieces of DNA bound to it, we sometimes observe a
dramatic effect on the structure of the hybrid molecule. The tree
edit distance of the hybrid structures predicted with RNA par—
ameters and with our hybrid approach rises up to 900, and the
structure of the binding site can vary greatly (Fig 1).

Another example for the usefulness of the mixed parameters is
the strand dependency of R—loop formation (Reddy et al, 2011).
A r(GAA),, trinucleotid repeat can form R—loops while its reverse
complement r(UUC),, cannot. The non—symmetric mixed
parameters can explain that: addition of another trinucleotid
will give 41.1 kcal/mol for r(GAA), but only 72.6kcal/mol for
r(UUC). In contrast to RNA or DNA parameters, the mixed
parameters can also explain the changes in R—loop formation
of other trinucleotides investigated (see Supplementary Fig. S2).

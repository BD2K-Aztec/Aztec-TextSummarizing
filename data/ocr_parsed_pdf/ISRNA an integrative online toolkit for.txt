ABSTRACT

Summary: Integrative Short Reads NAvigator (ISRNA) is an online
toolkit for analyzing high-throughput small RNA sequencing data.
Besides the high-speed genome mapping function, ISRNA provides
statistics for genomic location, length distribution and nucleotide com-
position bias analysis of sequence reads. Number of reads mapped to
known microRNAs and other classes of short non-coding RNAs,
coverage of short reads on genes, expression abundance of sequence
reads as well as some other analysis functions are also supported.
The versatile search functions enable users to select sequence reads
according to their sub-sequences, expression abundance, genomic
location, relationship to genes, etc. A specialized genome browser
is integrated to visualize the genomic distribution of short reads.
ISRNA also supports management and comparison among multiple
datasets.

Availability: ISRNA is implemented in Java/C++/Perl/MySQL and
can be freely accessed at http://omicslab.genetics.ac.cn/ISRNAl.

Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at
Bioinformatics online.

1 INTRODUCTION

The wide application of high-throughput sequencing technology
has given rise to signiﬁcant needs for powerful bioinformatics
tools to analyze the resulting data and retrieve useful informa-
tion. Although there have been some web-based and standalone
tools for high-throughput small RNA analysis available, many
of them mainly focus on microRNA (miRNA) identiﬁcation (An
et al., 2013; Hackenberg et al., 2011; Ronen et al., 2010; Sablok
et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2010) or small RNA
characterization (Chen et al., 2012; Fasold et al., 2011; Gupta
et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2010; Pantano et al., 2011; Stocks et al.,
2012; Zhang et al., 2012); few provide comprehensive feature
analysis, mining as well as Visualization and cross-sample com-
parison functions (see Supplementary Table S1 for detailed
comparison).

Here we introduce Integrative Short Reads NAVigator
(ISRNA), an online toolkit for searching, analyzing, Visualizing
and comparing short sequence reads. ISRNA integrates
several useful tools in a user-friendly way. Besides mapping

short sequence reads to a given genome and allowing a
genome browser to Visualize the position and distribution of se-
quence reads, ISRNA also calculates nucleotide composition,
identiﬁes known miRNAs and their homologous sequences,
predicts the secondary structure for the surrounding genomic
region of a short sequence and reveals genomic small RNA clus-
ters and genes producing small RNAs. It also provides versatile
searching functions and allows cross-dataset comparisons. All
these functions are easy to use with user-friendly outputs, making
ISRNA suitable for researchers with limited bioinformatics
skills.

2 DESIGN AND KEY FEATURES

2.1 Data processing and genome mapping

ISRNA takes raw FASTQ files or text ﬁles with sequence
and read count information, which can be generated by the
Perl script provided by ISRNA as inputs. For details, please
refer to the online user manual. The uploaded sequences
will be mapped to the corresponding genome by Bowtie
(Langmead et al., 2009) with user-defined parameters and
stored in a MySQL database. Sequences with a number
of mapped loci exceeding the threshold value will be
discarded.

2.2 Sequence analysis
The analysis functions of ISRNA include:

2.2.] Data overview This module analyzes some basic features
of the uploaded dataset to provide users the general information,
including sequencing depth, genome mapping results, sequence
length distribution, etc.

2.2.2 Nucleotide preference analysis This module enables users
to calculate the nucleotide composition at any defined position
among sequence reads with genomic matches, in both total and
non-redundant datasets.

2.2.3 Sequence annotation ISRNA uses the BLAST+ program
(Camacho et al., 2009) and Rfam (Burge et al., 2013) database to
annotate short sequence reads. The classiﬁcation results of se-
quences will be provided in a pie chart and be downloaded Via
the ‘Export’ function.

2.2.4 Known miRNA identification ISRNA identiﬁes known
miRNAs as well as isomiRNAs by mapping reads to the

mature and precursor sequences of known miRNAs collected in
the miRBase. The abundance of miRNAs or isoforms of
miRNAs (isomiRNAs) is estimated by the reads per million
values.

2.2.5 Secondary structure prediction ISRNA extracts the sur-
rounding genomic regions of input sequences and predicts their
secondary structures using the CentroidFold program (Sato
et al., 2009), which allows users to identify new miRNAs or
other classes of small RNAs with precursors of deﬁned structural
features.

2.3 Search functions

ISRNA provides powerful search functions that enable users to
analyze and curate their data with different needs (Fig. 1a),
including search by sequences (allowing mismatches, Fig. 1b),
search by miRNA, search by short read count, search by gen-
omic location, search by related genes/gene families and search
by read coverage on genes. A detailed description of the search
functions can be found in the Supplementary File.

2.4 Cross-dataset comparison

ISRNA supports comparison among multiple datasets within a
project. Differentially expressed sequence reads among datasets
can be identiﬁed by the implemented edgeR package (Robinson
et al., 2010), with user-adjustable P-Value and false discovery rate
thresholds. Genome distribution of sequence reads in multiple
datasets can be examined Via the cross-dataset comparison func-
tion (Fig. 10), which assists users in identifying differentially ex-
pressed genomic regions.

2.5 Genomic cluster analysis

This function permits users to identify clustered short sequences
on the genome, such as piwi-interacting RNAs or phased small

RNAs. Comparing the genomic cluster distribution of sequence
reads can also help to identify highly expressed sequence loci and
sequence read production hotspots.

2.6 Sequence read browser

In all search result display pages, a specialized genome browser is
integrated to show the genomic mapping results of short se-
quence reads and genes. Users can easily identify the positional
relationship among short sequence reads, as well as between
short sequence reads and annotated genes. The ID, genomic pos-
ition and annotation of genes, together with the information of
sequence reads, will be displayed Via mousing over the corres-
ponding gene or sequence read. Short reads are displayed by
cumulated short segments with color gradients representing the
sequence abundance (Fig. 1d). The genome browser also enables
users to examine the overall sequence distribution on each
chromosome, and therefore to identify regions enriched or
deprived of sequence reads.

3 CONCLUSIONS

We introduce ISRNA, a piece of online software designed for
storage, Visualization and analysis of small RNA sequencing
data produced by high-throughput sequencing technologies.
The comprehensive data analysis, search and cross-dataset com-
parison functions, as well as the user-friendly output of ISRNA,
make it a practical and easy-to-use tool for researchers with
limited bioinformatics analysis skills.

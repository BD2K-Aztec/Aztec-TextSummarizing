Relative effect size

Fig. 3. The densities of effect sizes for DE genes for different values of 71A
with pa = 1

values were chosen so that the proportion of genes identified as
significantly DE in our simulation study would range over values
typically seen in practice.

For each simulation setting in each simulation study, 500 data—
sets were randomly generated and analyzed.

3.1 Simulations using independent normal data

In the first simulation study, data were randomly generated from
independent normal distributions. For each dataset, data for
each gene j= l,  , 10000 were generated as follows. The vari—
ance of was randomly selected from an inverse gamma distribu—
tion. The parameters of the inverse gamma distribution were
calculated from the dataset of an experiment described in
Hannenhalli et a]. (2006) using methods proposed by Smyth
(2004). If gene j was EE, then [Ll/1:12]? =0. If gene j was DE,
then Mil = 0 and the effect size [2/2 = 6/ was randomly drawn from
the mixture distribution

h1(6) = MN; M501» 0})+ (1 — m)¢(6; 4w.» Of), (5)

where ¢(6; y, 12) is the normal density with mean y and variance
12 evaluated at 6. Finally, 11 values were randomly drawn from a
Normal(/ij,, a?) distribution for each treatment I = l, 2.

3.2 Simulations using gene expression data

The second simulation study used microarray data from an ex—
periment in which gene expressions were measured from the
heart tissue of N = 108 human subjects suffering from idiopathic
dilated cardiomyopathy. This experiment is described in detail in
Hannenhalli et a]. (2006), and the data generated from this ex—
periment are available from the Gene Expression Omnibus under
accession number GSE5406. Although this dataset contains data
from over 20 000 genes, m = 10 000 genes were randomly selected
for analysis in the simulation study. The expression values for
each dataset were generated as follows. For each gene
j= l, . . . , m, the variance s]? was calculated from all N subjects.
Then, data from two 11 subjects were randomly drawn, without
replacement, from the microarray dataset. From this subset of
data, the data from 11 subjects were randomly chosen to be in the
first treatment, and the data from the remaining 11 subjects were
assigned to the second treatment. Note that, at this point, be—
cause the data from both treatments were randomly drawn from

the same population, the population treatment means were equal
(i.e. [,le = [2/2) for each gene. If gene j was EE, the data from this
gene was not altered in any way. If gene j was DE, then the effect
size, 6], was randomly chosen from mixture model (5), but by
replacing a} with s_,-. Then (3, was added to the data from gene j in
the second treatment. Note that this method of data generation
did not change the correlation structure of the data in any way
but only shifted the mean of the data between the two treatments
for DE genes.

3.3 Results

Tables 1 and 2 as well as Supplementary Tables $1 and S2 (pro—
vided in the Supplementary Materials) present the results of the
simulation studies. For each setting in each simulation study, the
mean (based on the 500 simulated datasets) partial area under
the receiver—operating characteristic (ROC) curve (pAUC) is
given with its corresponding standard error in parentheses.
These are partial areas because we considered only the most
relevant region of the ROC curve where the false—positive rate
was 30.10. The method that ranks the genes better with regard
to differential expression will have a higher pAUC. For each
simulation setting, a traditional paired t—test was performed to
test for a difference in the mean pAUCs of the proposed method
and the traditional q—value method. If this test was significant at
5%, then the higher mean pAUC is presented in bold font in
Tables 1 and 2 and the supplementary tables. Additionally, if the
higher mean pAUC is at least 5% greater than the lower mean
pAUC, then the higher mean pAUC is also underlined, and this
method was considered to ‘outperform’ the other method. The
5% improvement criterion was used to avoid situations where
the mean pAUC was very similar between the proposed and
traditional methods, in some cases equal when rounded to one
decimal, but the t—test indicated a statistically signiﬁcant (though
not practically signiﬁcant) difference. The combination of the
two criteria allowed for the identification of simulation settings
where both practical and statistical significance were present. In
addition, mean S, the mean number of DE genes that were
declared to be DE when FDR is nominally controlled at 5% is
also given for each setting to observe the number of correctly
identified DE genes, on average. Similar to the pAUCs, t—tests
were used to determine whether one method produced a larger
mean S and whether the higher mean S was at least 5% greater
than the lower mean S. Also, to verify that each method ad—
equately controls FDR, the empirical approximation of FDR
was calculated for each method while nominally controlling
FDR at 5%. We will call this quantity m, which is the average
of the dataset—specific fractions defined as the proportion of EB
genes among all genes with q—values £0.05 or 0 if no genes have
q—values £0.05.

Regardless of data type, both mean pAUC and mean S in—
crease as the sample size increases as well as when the mean effect
size increases for both the proposed and traditional q—value
methods. This is unsurprising, as increasing the sample size or
the mean effect size increases the power for detecting differential
expression.

For the simulations involving normally distributed data with
M5 = 1 (see Table l), the proposed method performed better in 12
of 60 simulation settings with regard to mean pAUC, including

Note: For each setting, for both the mean pAUC and mean S, the highest values are given in bold font if a t—test has determined that there is a difference in the means of the
proposed and traditional methods at 5% signiﬁcance. If the t—test was not signiﬁcant, bold font is not used. Statistically signiﬁcant improvements that we deemed practically

signiﬁcant (at least 5% improvement) are indicated by underlining.

12 of 20 simulation settings with n = 4. In regard to mean S, the
proposed method performed better in 25 of 60 simulation set—
tings, including 18 of 20 settings with n = 4. The traditional
method did not perform better than the proposed method in
any simulation setting in terms of mean pAUC or mean S.
When the mean effect size is increased to M5 =2 (see
Supplementary Table S1 in the Supplementary Materials), the
proposed method outperformed the traditional method with
regard to pAUC in 8 of 60 settings, all of which are in simulation
settings with n = 4. For mean S, the proposed method outper—
formed the traditional method in 16 of 60 settings, including 14
of 20 settings with n = 4. As with M5 = l, the traditional method
did not outperform the proposed method in terms of mean
pAUC or mean S in any simulation setting.

For simulations involving microarray data with u5=1, the
proposed method performed better than the traditional methods
in 17 of 60 (14 of 20 settings with n = 4) and 23 of 60 (17 of 20
settings with n = 4) simulation settings in regard to mean pAUC
and mean S, respectively. The traditional method did not perform
better than the proposed method in any simulation setting in
terms of mean pAUC or mean S. When M5 =2 (see
Supplementary Table S2 in the Supplementary Materials), the
proposed method outperformed the traditional method in mean
pAUC in only 5 of 60 simulation settings, all when n = 4. In
terms of mean S, the proposed method outperformed the trad—
itional method in 15 of 60 settings, 13 of which when n = 4. The
traditional method did not outperform the proposed method in
any simulation settings in terms of mean pAUC or mean S.

When taking into account all simulation settings with nor—
mally distributed data, all of the 20 simulation settings in
which the proposed method outperformed the traditional
method in terms of mean pAUC were with 71A 3 0.8. For
mean S, 33 (80.1%) of the 41 simulation settings in which the
proposed method performed better had 71A 3 0.8. Among all
simulation settings involving microarray data, 18 (81.8%) of
the 22 simulation settings in which the proposed method outper—
formed the tradition method in terms of pAUC occurred when
71A 3 0.8. For mean S, this occurred in 31 (81.6%) of 38 settings.
Additionally, among the 42 simulation settings across all 240
simulations in which the proposed method outperformed the
traditional method in terms of pAUC, 39 (92.9%) occurred in
simulation settings with n = 4. Among the 79 simulation settings

where the proposed method outperformed the traditional
method in terms of mean S, 62 (78.5%) occurred in simulation
settings with n = 4. The proposed method never outperformed
the traditional method in simulation settings with n = 20 with
regard to either mean pAUC or mean S. The traditional method
did not outperform the proposed method in any simulation
setting.

As shown in the last two columns of Tables 1 and 2 and
Supplementary Tables S1 and S2, both the proposed and trad—
itional methods adequately controlled FDR near the 5% level
across all simulation settings and data types.

4 REAL DATA ANALYSIS

4.1 Thale cress seedlings

In this section, we analyze data from a study described in Jang
et a]. (2014) using both the proposed and traditional q—value
methods. In this study, expressions from m = 22810 genes in
thale cress seedlings were compared between two genotypes,
wild—type and mutant, using six Affymetrix Arabidopsis
Genome ATHl Arrays, with n = 3 for each genotype. Mutant
seedlings contained a transfer DNA insertion that the wild—type
seedlings did not. Data from this experiment are available from
the Gene Expression Omnibus under access number GSE48114.

The test statistics from this experiment are shown in the histo—
gram in Figure 1. There is asymmetry in this histogram, as there
are more negative test statistics than positive test statistics, sug—
gesting asymmetry in the effect sizes. More speciﬁcally, there are
m1 = 12355 genes with negative test statistics and m2= 10455
genes corresponding to positive test statistics. The asymmetry
becomes more evident in Figure 2, where P—values corresponding
to negative test statistics follow a distribution that is stochastic—
ally smaller than the distribution of P—values corresponding to
positive test statistics.

Using Storey and Tibshirani’s (2003) natural cubic spline
method, the estimated number of EB genes in this experiment
is rho = 17933.75. Because we expect there to be the same
number of negative and positive test statistics among the EB
genes, we estimate that there are rho/2=8966.875 EE genes
with negative test statistics and rho/2=8966.875 EE genes with
positive test statistics. From these estimates, we can also estimate

Note: For each setting, for both the mean pAUC and mean S, the highest values are given in bold font if a t—test has determined that there is a difference in the means of the
proposed and traditional methods at 5% signiﬁcance. If the t—test was not signiﬁcant, bold font is not used. Statistically signiﬁcant improvements that we deemed practically

signiﬁcant (at least 5% improvement) are indicated by underlining.

that there are approximately 12 355 — 8967=3388 DE genes
with negative effect sizes and 10455 — 8967=l488 DE genes
with positive effect sizes. This results in a final estimate of
3388/(3388-l- 1488) B 69.4% of DE genes with negative effect
sizes. Therefore, although asymmetry in the test statistics is not
visibly obvious, it is likely that there is a high degree of asym—
metry in the distribution of effect sizes of DE genes. Based on the
results of the simulation studies in Section 3.3, it is appropriate to
use the proposed method for computing q—values to identify DE
genes. This can be done by using (3) to estimate the FDR for

each gene k= 1, . . . , 12 355 with a negative test statistic as
(l) 8 966.875
qf3=mianzr=k,...,12355}, (6)
and we can estimate FDR for each gene k= 1, . . . , 10 455 with a

positive test statistic as

=k,...,10455}. (7)

Figure 4 plots the log ratio of the q—values versus the test
statistics from the proposed and traditional method for the
gene expression experiment in thale cress seedlings. Negative
log ratios correspond to cases where the q—value from the pro—
posed method was less than the q—value from the traditional
method. Positive log ratios correspond to larger q—values for
the proposed method. From this scatterplot, we can clearly see
that the proposed method produces smaller q—values than the
traditional method for genes with negative test statistics and
larger q—values for genes with positive test statistics, with a
clear separation when the test statistic is 0. This is not surprising
based on Figure 2 and the discussion in Section 2.3.

Using the traditional q—value method, 490 genes were declared
to be DE when controlling FDR at 5%. The proposed method
declared 617 genes DE, a 25.9% increase over the traditional
method. There were 417 genes that both methods declared to
be DE. All 200 of the genes that were only declared DE by the
proposed method had negative test statistics. Similarly, all of the
73 genes that were only declared DE by the traditional method
had positive test statistics. This is what we would expect based on

4.2 Maize leaves

The analysis of data from a microarray experiment described in
Covshoff et a]. (2008) is brieﬂy summarized here. In this study,
expressions from m = 7377 genes in the mesophyll cells of maize
leaves were compared between two genotypes, wild—type and
mutant, using 11 = 6 two—color microarray slides. Mutant
plants lacked the PSII activity of wild—type plants, and re—
searchers were interested in identifying genes that have different
mean expressions due to this lack of activity. Data from this
experiment are available at the Gene Expression Omnibus
under accession number GSE9698.

The empirical distribution of test statistic values, shown in the
histogram in Figure 5, is clearly asymmetric. There are m1 = 4141
genes with negative test statistics and m2 =3236 genes corres—
ponding to positive test statistics. Estimating the number of EE
genes results in rho =2907.11. Using similar methods as in
Section 4, we estimate that ~2687 genes are DE with negative
effect sizes, and 1782 genes are DE with positive effect sizes,
resulting in an estimated 60.1% of DE genes having negative
effect sizes.

The proposed method declares fewer genes to be DE than the
traditional method (2260 versus 2446). Similar to the analysis of

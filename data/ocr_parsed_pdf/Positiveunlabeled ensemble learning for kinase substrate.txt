Abstract

Motivation: Protein phosphorylation is a post—translational modification that underlines various as—
pects of cellular signaling. A key step to reconstructing signaling networks involves identification
of the set of all kinases and their substrates. Experimental characterization of kinase substrates is
both expensive and time—consuming. To expedite the discovery of novel substrates, computational
approaches based on kinase recognition sequence (motifs) from known substrates, protein struc—
ture, interaction and co—localization have been proposed. However, rarely do these methods take
into account the dynamic responses of signaling cascades measured from in vivo cellular systems.
Given that recent advances in mass spectrometry—based technologies make it possible to quantify
phosphorylation on a proteome—wide scale, computational approaches that can integrate static fea—
tures with dynamic phosphoproteome data would greatly facilitate the prediction of biologically
relevant kinase—specific substrates.

Results: Here, we propose a positive—unlabeled ensemble learning approach that integrates
dynamic phosphoproteomics data with static kinase recognition motifs to predict novel substrates
for kinases of interest. We extended a positive—unlabeled learning technique for an ensemble
model, which significantly improves prediction sensitivity on novel substrates of kinases while re—
taining high specificity. We evaluated the performance of the proposed model using simulation
studies and subsequently applied it to predict novel substrates of key kinases relevant to insulin
signaling. Our analyses show that static sequence motifs and dynamic phosphoproteomics data
are complementary and that the proposed integrated model performs better than methods relying
only on static information for accurate prediction of kinase—specific substrates.

correct for prediction bias. These corrected base classifiers are then
integrated to form the ensemble of SVMs, and the final predictions
are made based on the combined probability from all base
classifiers.

2.1 Base classifier

Let xi (1' : 1. .... n) denote phosphorylation sites and let 3/, E {—1.1}
be a binary label indicating whether xi is a substrate (31,: 1) of a kin—
ase or not (3/, : —1). We use SVM, implemented by Chang and Lin
(2011), to form the bases of an ensemble classifier. In dual formula—
tion, an SVM is expressed as

n 1 n n
maxaL(oc) I :09 — EZZyiyyociocyk(xi.xy)
i:1

i:1 ;:1

n
subject to : Zyioci : 0. 0 S or, S C.
i:1

where or, are Lagrange multipliers and xi for which or, > 0 are sup—
port vectors. The parameter C controls the fraction of support vec—
tors, and the kernel of the classifier is defined by k(xi.x;).
Specifically, we use nonlinear classifiers with radial basis function
kernels, which is expressed as

1 2
k§3F(xi,x;) = eXp(-; llxi — #1) )7

where a is a parameter that controls the width of the radial basis
function. When data are linearly inseparable, using SVMs
with nonlinear kernel functions can provide better classifica—
tion accuracy while also retaining the robustness of linear classi—
fiers on background noise. The default parameters were used in
this study where C : 1 and 0 equals to the feature dimension of the
data.

2.2 Ensemble model

Kinase substrate prediction can be formulated as constructing a
model f(x), such that f(x) : p(y : 11x) approximates the truth.
For most kinases, often there are only a handful of experimentally
validated substrates. We denote them as x E P, where P is the set
of validated substrates and hence positive. After excluding these
positive substrates, the number of remaining phosphorylation
sites (denoted by set U) profiled from a large—scale phosphoproteo—
mics studies can easily exceed several thousand. This makes the
prediction of kinase substrates from phosphoproteomics data an
inherent class imbalanced learning problem, because the number
of positive instances are significantly outnumbered by the rest of
the profiled but as yet unannotated phosphorylation sites (P < U).
Many popular classification algorithms, including SVMs that were
used as the base classifiers of the ensemble, are sensitive to the
imbalanced class distribution and would perform poorly without
correction of the class distribution of the training instances (Tang
et al., 2009).

An effective approach to address this class imbalance is to create
an ensemble classifier by sampling from the original dataset and cre—
ating base classifiers, each trained on a balanced subset (Yang et al.,
2014). This strategy can be modified for solving the imbalanced
class problem in our phosphoproteomics application by randomly
sampling from U and combining them with members of P to form
balanced subsets (U1 U P. U2 U P. .... U, U P), where r is the number
of sampling operations performed. These subsets can then be used to

train the base classifiers from which the ensemble is obtained for
prediction:

. 1 ’
phry : 11x) :;Zp(y : 11x; U,- UP)
i:1

The above prediction is an estimate of the combined probability 17E of
a given phosphorylation site x to be a positive substrate of a kinase.

2.3 Positive—unlabeled learning in ensemble

One complication in applying the ensemble model described above
is that U is an unannotated set that comprises a mixture of unidenti—
fied substrates of a given kinase as well as negatives. This is known
as the positive—unlabeled learning problem where only a small set of
positive instances are known, while the rest of the data contains
both positive and negative instances but are unlabeled (Letouzey
et al., 2000). The ensemble model described above makes a naive as—
sumption by treating all members of U (that is, x g P) as negative in—
stances for sampling and training the base classifiers. The model
would therefore predict conservatively and may penalize heavily on
novel substrates because they may be selected as negative instances
in model training. This is undesirable since our goal is precisely to
discover from U the set of novel substrates.

It has been shown that by multiplying a correction factor, esti—
mated from a data repartitioned approach, one can correct for the
prediction bias on the unannotated set (Elkan and Noto, 2008). Here,
we extend this positive—unlabeled learning technique for our ensemble
classifier by estimating the correction factors for individual base clas—
sifiers and subsequently correcting their prediction bias in ensemble
classification. Let s : 1 if the instance x is labeled, and s :—1 other—
wise. Since only experimentally validated substrates are labeled, 3/ : 1
is certain when 5: 1, whereas 3/ could be 1 or —1 when 52—1.
Therefore, by treating all labeled instances as positive and all un—
labeled ones as negative, we are in fact learning g(x) : p(s : 11x)
and using this as approximation to p(y : 11x). Elkan and New
(2008) have mathematically proved that p(y : 11x) : p(s : 1)x)/c,
where c : p(s : 11y : 1) and by reserving a subset of validation data
from the training data the value of c can be estimated as

1
c I ; X:xeP‘g<x>7

where P" is a set of labeled instances in the validation dataset and m
is the cardinality of P".

For our ensemble classifier, we have, for each base classifier,
gi(x) : p(s : 11x; U, U P). (i : 1.....1’). Therefore, a correction fac—
tor can be estimated by reserving a validation dataset for each base
classifier gi(x) and ensemble model with prediction correction can
then be expressed as

. 1 r
1750 = 11x) = ;Zp(s = 11x; U1 U P)/ci
i:1

1
Ci : EerPfgi

The corrected and combined probability pf is the estimation of x
being a positive substrate of a given kinase.

2.4 Static and dynamic feature extraction from
phosphoproteomics data

We demonstrate the proposed approach on a previously published
phosphoproteomics dataset where insulin stimulation of 3T3—L1
adipocytes was performed to quantify the insulin signaling

Positive—unlabeled ensemble learning for kinase substrate prediction 255

 

phosphoproteome in adipocyte cells (Humphrey et al., 2013). The
phosphopeptides were quantified in biological triplicates and
included a serum—starved (‘basal’) control and a time—course of insu—
lin treatment (at 15 s, 30 s, 1 min, 2min, 5 min, 10min, 20min and
60min), as well as cells treated with or without PI3K/mTOR or Akt
inhibitors (LY294002 and MK2206, respectively) applied for
30min prior to a 20—min insulin treatment. Data were filtered to se—
lect phosphorylation sites that are quantified in at least one of the
three biological replicates in each time point and the basal condi—
tion. This resulted in 12 289 phosphorylation sites.

For each kinase of interest, a positive training set of annotated
substrates was curated from a combination of PhosphoSitePlus
(Hornbeck et al., 2011) database and manual extraction from litera—
ture. Next, the PSSM was calculated for each kinase of interest using
the six amino acids flanking the actual phosphorylation site (total
length: 13) of its annotated substrates as

where l is the number of annotated substrates, / is the sequence win—
dow size and k is the set of 20 amino acids. All identified phosphor—
ylation sites are then scored against Mk,- to determine their

similarity to the annotated substrates.

For dynamic features from phosphoproteome profiling, we cal—
culate, for each phosphorylation site, the log 2—fold change at each
time point compared with basal control and the log 2—fold change
before and after inhibitor treatments. In addition, we extracted
several secondary features for each phosphorylation site from its
temporal pattern. These include the mathematical mean of the
log 2—fold change at each time point compared with basal control,
the area under the temporal profile calculated as follows:

and the goodness of a polynomial (degree of two) curve fit measured
by F—test as follows:

where t is the number of time points, 3!, is the standardized log 2—
fold change at time point i, )9,- is the fitted value of y, and Si is the
unfitted residuals from the model at time point i.

2.5 Performance evaluation and comparison

To compare the performance of our models and other commonly
used kinase—specific substrate prediction tools, we used an array of
evaluation metrics including sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), F1
score, geometric mean (GM) and Matthews correlation coefficient
(MCC) defined as follows:

5 7 TP . S 7 TN .
e’T1>+1:N’ p’FPHN’
ZTP TP TP
F1’2TP+FP+FN; GM’ TP+FNXTP+FP;
Mcc: TPxTNiFPxFN

 

\/(TP+FP) >< (TP+FN) >< (TN+FP) >< (TN+FN)’

where TP, TN, PP and FN denote the number of true positives, true
negatives, false positives and false negatives, respectively.

Beside using metrics defined above for evaluating a single classi—
fication threshold, we also generated Precision/Recall curves to
evaluate the performance of the model trained using both motif and
phosphoproteomics data and those trained using only motif or phos—
phoproteomics data across a range of threshold by varying the clas—
sification cutoff c as follows:

. . TP(c) TP(c)
Preclslon(c) :T—P(C) + 1:P(C); Recall(c) :—TP<C) + FN<C> .

Methods with predefined prediction thresholds that cannot be
adjusted to an arbitrary cutoff are represented as single points in the
Precision/Recall comparison plot.

In the simulation study, we repeatedly generated 10 simulation
datasets and for each dataset we trained and compared the predic—
tion accuracy of a single SVM model, an uncorrected ensemble mod—
el and a corrected ensemble model using the evaluation metrics
described above. To evaluate the individual contributions of the
‘static’ motif information and the dynamic phosphoproteome infor—
mation, we created partial models using either motif or phosphopro—
teomics data and compared these with the model trained with both
using the dynamic phosphoproteomics data. In addition, we also
compared the performance of our approach with other commonly
used kinase—specific substrate prediction tools including GPS 3.0
(Xue et al., 2008), iGPS 1.0 (Song et al., 2012), KinasePhos 1.0
(Huang et al., 2005), KinasePhos 2.0 (Wong et al., 2007), NetPhosK
1.0 (Hjerrild et al., 2004) and NetworKIN 3.0 (Horn et al., 2014).
We used the default/suggested parameters for each prediction tool.
Specifically, the prediction specificity of HMM is set to 0.9 for
KinasePhos 1.0, the prediction specificity of SVM is set to 0.8 for
KinasePhos 2.0, the minimum score of 2.0 and the max difference of
4.0 is set for NetworKIN 3.0, the prediction threshold is set to 0.5
for NetPhosK 1.0, high for GPS 3.0 and high for iGPS 1.0. For cal—
culating sensitivity, the annotated substrates were treated as positive
instances, and leave—one—out cross—validation was used for our
model evaluation. For calculating specificity, since we do not know
the set of true negative phosphorylation sites, we assumed that only
a very small fraction of phosphorylation sites in the unlabeled set of
U are positive instances with most of them being negative instances.
On the basis of this assumption, we randomly sampled five sets of
phosphorylation sites from all profiled phosphorylation sites,
excluding annotated substrates of Akt and mTOR and evaluated
each method on each of the five negative sets. The performance of
each method is reported as the mean plus and minus the standard
deviation.

3 Results

3.1 Evaluation of positive—unlabeled ensemble

learning on synthetic data

We generated synthetic datasets to analyze the behavior of different
classification models in classifying data with highly imbalanced class
distribution and with positive and unlabeled instances. Figure 2a
shows a typical example where a synthetic dataset is simulated with
10 positive instances (red points) with two features both generated
from a Gaussian distribution N(6.5. 1) and 10500 unlabeled in—
stances, of which 500 are unannotated positive instances (dark blue
points) and the remaining 10 000 are negative instances (cyan
points) generated from a Gaussian distribution N(4.5. 1). In this ex—
ample, a single SVM would predict every instance, including the 10
positives, as a negative (purple region in Fig. 2b). This is because the
negative class is significantly over—represented in the training data.

performance of the models using both types of information performed
better in both Akt and mTOR substrate prediction. This is especially

88.5%, while for the models trained on only motif or phosphopro-
teome data, this is 80.8%. It is evident that PUEL performs better
across the range of classification thresholds for mTOR and Akt, based
on Precision/Recall curves (Fig. 6a). These results demonstrate the
complementary nature of static sequence motifs and dynamic phos-
phoproteome data in kinase substrate prediction. It is also evident that
PUEL outperforms the ensemble model without positive-unlabeled
learning (‘EL’) (Table 2), which demonstrates a contribution by posi-
tive-unlabeled ensemble learning toward kinase substrate prediction.

To assess the performance of our approach in relation to that of
other approaches, we evaluated substrate prediction accuracy for
Akt and mTOR kinases using six popular kinase substrate predic-
tion tools (Table 2). For Akt substrate prediction, our ensemble ap-
proach achieved the highest sensitivity and specificity. NetworKIN
and NetPhosK 1.0 performed comparably with high specificity but
with relatively low sensitivity. Compared with KinasePhos 2.0,
KinasePhos 1.0 offers good sensitivity but lower specificity. GPS 3.0
has a perfect prediction sensitivity for Akt substrate prediction.
However, this seems to be achieved by sacrificing specificity. iGPS
1.0 improves the specificity compared with GPS 3.0 but at the cost
of sensitivity. For mTOR substrate prediction, GPS 3.0 did not per-
form as well as our approach. Its variant iGPS 1.0 did not predict
any tested phosphorylation sites to be a positive substrate of mTOR.
The pre-trained models used by KinasePhos 1.0/2.0, NetPhosK 1.0
and NetworKIN 3.0 preclude them from making substrates predic-
tions for mTOR. Overall, the positive-unlabeled ensemble model
performed better than other methods in predicting both Akt and
mTOR substrates according to the evaluation metrics (Table 2) as
well as the Precision/Recall curves (Fig. 6a).

Figure 6b shows the prediction scores (z-axis) of Akt and mTOR
substrates, respectively, using the positive-unlabeled ensemble model
with both motif features and phosphoproteome features. The contri-
bution of motif feature and the phosphoproteome features are plot-
ted on x-axis and y-axis. A complementarity pattern of motif score
and phosphoproteome score can be seen in both Akt and mTOR

predictions. These results argue for the utilization and integration of
dynamic features extracted from phosphoproteomics data with trad—
itional motif features. Table 3 lists the top 20 substrates predicted
for Akt and mTOR, with Supplementary Table 52 containing the
full list of predictions.

4 Conclusion

In this study, we developed a positive—unlabeled ensemble learning ap—
proach that enables the accurate prediction of kinase—specific substrates
by integrating motif information derived from amino acid sequences
surrounding the phosphorylation recognition sites with dynamic
phosphorylation patterns quantified in large—scale time—series phospho—
proteomics studies. We extended the positive—unlabeled learning tech—
niques for ensemble learning and illustrated how such an application
can improve the prediction sensitivity while retaining high specificity
for kinase—substrate prediction. Finally, we demonstrated the comple—
mentary nature of the static features extracted from sequence motif
and the dynamic features extracted from phosphoproteomics data.
Compared with traditional sequence motif—centric methods, our study
suggests an alternative approach for predicting kinase—specific sub—
strates that incorporates and exploits the wealth of physiological infor—
mation captured by large—scale phosphoproteomics studies.

With the recent development of high—throughput methods prom—
ising to streamline the generation of large—scale phosphoproteomics
data (Humphrey et al., 2015), we anticipate that the methods
described here will become an increasingly valuable approach for
enabling prediction of kinase substrates, while preserving the dy—
namic and cellular context of the biological system being studied.

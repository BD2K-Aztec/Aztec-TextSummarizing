Abstract

Summary: Breast cancer is one of the most frequent cancers among women. Extensive studies into
the molecular heterogeneity of breast cancer have produced a plethora of molecular subtype classifica—
tion and prognosis prediction algorithms, as well as numerous gene expression signatures. However,
reimplementation of these algorithms is a tedious but important task to enable comparison of existing
signatures and classification models between each other and with new models. Here, we present the
genefu R/Bioconductor package, a multi—tiered compendium of bioinformatics algorithms and gene
signatures for molecular subtyping and prognostication in breast cancer.

Availability and implementation: The genefu package is available from Bioconductor. http://www.
bioconductor.org/packages/deveI/bioc/htmI/genefu.html. Source code is also available on Github

1 Introduction

Breast cancer is a devastating disease whose management is compli-
cated by its high molecular heterogeneity. Breast cancer is categorized
into at least four clinically relevant molecular subtypes that reﬂect
upon expression levels of specific genes (Koboldt et (11., 2012).
These are ‘HerZ-enriched’ (also called HER2+), ‘Triple-negative breast
cancers” (ERi/HERlilPRi, similar to basal-like) and ‘Luminal-like’
which are mainly ER+/HER27 that could be further discriminated
into luminal A and B based on their low and high proliferative

phenotype, respectively. These classifications have showed that breast
cancer is not a single disease but is rather highly heterogeneous. Breast
cancer subtypes exhibit distinct transcriptomic patterns that are associ-
ated with outcome, which emphasizes the relevance of these subtypes
for basic and translational research (Sotiriou and Pusztai, 2009).
Among various molecular techniques, gene expression profiling in
particular has increasingly been used to refine breast cancer stratifica-
tion, and to assess prognosis and response to therapy (Prat et (11., 2012).
Studies to identify gene expression patterns of clinical potential have

produced a considerable number of prognostic predictors and subtype—
specific prognostic signatures. However, varying reports of prognostic
signatures across breast cancer subtypes render comparison of these
approaches difficult. Multiple meta—analyses of gene signatures indi—
cated that the majority share similar performance, despite the limited
overlap of genes (Desmedt et al., 2008; Fan et al., 2006). Importantly,
the prognostic value of the vast majority of these signatures were lim—
ited to luminal—like breast tumors, calling for the development of sub—
type—specific prognostic models (Haibe—Kains et al., 2010). Subtype—
specific prognoses however are also largely dependent on the proper
identification of the major biological subtypes. The parallel develop—
ment of breast cancer subtyping methods has also produced a signifi—
cant number of classification algorithms, with diverse taxonomies.

The large body of literature on the molecular complexity of breast
cancer has introduced a burden of computational complexity for re—
searchers. The advent of high—throughput genomics and next—gener—
ation sequencing promises unprecedented views into the major
biological breast cancer subtypes (Schnitt, 2010). However, there is a
dire need for an accessible, computational platform that can easily sus—
tain the growing variety of breast cancer classification and prognostic
algorithms. This will facilitate both meta—analyses of breast cancer data
as well as cross comparison of different computational methods. Here,
we have developed the genefu package, a multi—leveled compendium
that provides bioinformatics implementations of classification algo—
rithms to identify molecular subtypes, as well as prognostic predictors
along with their published gene signatures (Table 1, Supplementary
Fig. 51). Notably, we have incorporated the most recently developed
molecular subtyping algorithms in the field, including the IntClust
(Curtis et al., 2012), the IHC4 prognostic scoring algorithm (Dowsett
et al., 2013), the Absolute Intrinsic Molecular Subypting (AIMS) algo—
rithm (Paquet and Hallett, 2015), as well as the classification algorithm
for prediction of claudin—low breast cancer samples (Prat et al., 2010).
The package also includes other functions to facilitate quick manipula—
tion of gene expression datasets, including gene selection and probe—
gene mapping across microarray platforms.

2 Molecular subtyping

We have implemented nine molecular subtyping algorithms within
genefu, which facilitates the identification of molecular subtypes as
well as assessment of stratified patient data. We compare here the
molecular subtype predictions across five public datasets using the

PAM50 and SCMOD2 algorithms. Both PAM50 and SCMOD2 pre—
dict patients that belong to the Basal—like, and Her2—enriched sub—
types, as well as distinguish between the Luminal A (LumA) and
Luminal B (LumB) subtypes. PAM50 additionally identifies ‘nor—
mal—like’ patients. Overall, there is a concordance of ~85% between
both predictors (Supplementary Data 51). Despite the lack of com—
plete concordance between the two algorithms, patient survival
across subtypes is virtually identical between the two subtyping
schemes (Fig. 1A). Notably, survival is the highest for LumA pa—
tients, while patients LumB, Her2—enriched and Basal—like tumors
display the poorest survival. This indicates that different molecular
subtyping algorithms are consistent and yield similar prognostic
value across breast cancer subtypes.

3 Prognostication of breast cancer

Our implementation of numerous prognostic predictors as part of
genefu facilitates meta—analysis of prognostic signatures across sev—
eral breast cancer datasets. We previously demonstrated that the
majority of prognostic signatures show similar performance despite
limited genetic overlaps between them (Desmedt et al., 2008;
Wirapati et al., 2008). We showed that many of published gene sig—
natures were affected by the presence of proliferation—related genes,
rendering the signature informative for prognosis of ER+/HER2—
patients, but less informative for basal—like and HER2—enriched pa—
tients. To improve prognostication for these subtypes, we imple—
mented a new risk prediction model, called GENIUS, which uses a
fuzzy computational approach combining risk prediction models
specific to each molecular subtype (Haibe-Kains et al., 2010). We
have subsequently demonstrated that Gaussian—based clustering
based on gene sets specifically correlated with the ER, HER2 and
AURKA genes can robustly identify breast cancer molecular sub—
types (Haibe-Kains et al., 2012).

In this case study, we used genefu to conduct a meta—analysis of 12
risk predictors across 713 node—negative, untreated breast cancer patients
(Supplementary Data 51). For comparison, three of our predictors were
based on using just one of three key breast cancer genes (represented
here as AURKA, ESR1 and ERBB2). We calculated the risk score per—
formance of each predictor, measured by the concordance index, across
the five breast cancer datasets (Supplementary Fig. S2). The concordance
index estimates the probability that, for a random pair of patients, the

tant metastasis free survival or recurrence-free survival sample time points,
dependent on the dataset. Dataset-specific concordance indices were finally
combined into overall estimates for each risk prediction model. The per-
formed analysis includes biology-driven signatures (AURKA, ESR1, ERBB2
and PIK3CA) as well as prognostic-driven signatures

patient with earlier recurrence has a higher risk score than the patients
with either later or no recurrence. Using a random-effects model, we
combined the dataset—specific performance estimates into an overall per-
formance estimate for each risk prediction model (Fig. 1B). Our findings
suggest significant prognostic value for all multi—gene predictors.
Notably, using a single proliferation gene (AURKA) produces a similar
performance to the majority of other predictors.

4 Application across data platforms

Many of the molecular subtyping algorithms and gene expression sig-
natures implemented within genefu have originally been derived from
microarray gene expression data. This raises an important question as
to whether such methods can be used on data generated on RNA
sequencing platforms. We have previously compared the agreement
between microarray and RNAs sequencing platforms on several prog-
nostic signatures and classifiers from genefu (Fumagalli et al., 2014).
This analysis was conducted on six molecular subtyping algorithms
(SCMOD1, SCMO2, SCMGENE, SSP2003, SSP2006 and PAM50)

and several prognostic-driven signatures including GENE70, GGI,
RORS, ENDOPREDICT, among other gene expression signatures.
We have demonstrated that the clinically relevant single genes and
gene expression signatures originally defined by microarray technol-
ogy can be used to reliably evaluate RNA sequencing data. The code
for this analysis is additionally available on github at https://github.
com/bhklab/DNA11161.

5 Conclusions

The genefu package provides a unified framework for integration of
molecular subtype and survival analysis of breast cancer. We have
demonstrated how the package can be utilized to perform both
meta-analyses across datasets and across algorithms, to facilitate
integrated analysis of breast cancer gene expression profiles.

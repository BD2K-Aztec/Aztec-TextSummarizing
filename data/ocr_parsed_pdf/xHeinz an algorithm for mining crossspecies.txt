Abstract

Motivation: Integrative network analysis methods provide robust interpretations of differential
high—throughput molecular profile measurements. They are often used in a biomedical context—to
generate novel hypotheses about the underlying cellular processes or to derive biomarkers for
classification and subtyping. The underlying molecular profiles are frequently measured and vali—
dated on animal or cellular models. Therefore the results are not immediately transferable to
human. In particular, this is also the case in a study of the recently discovered interleukin—17 pro—
ducing helper T cells (Th17), which are fundamental for anti—microbial immunity but also known to
contribute to autoimmune diseases.

Results: We propose a mathematical model for finding active subnetwork modules that are con—
served between two species. These are sets of genes, one for each species, which (i) induce a con—
nected subnetwork in a species—specific interaction network, (ii) show overall differential behavior
and (iii) contain a large number of orthologous genes. We propose a flexible notion of conserva—
tion, which turns out to be crucial for the quality of the resulting modules in terms of biological
interpretability. We propose an algorithm that finds provably optimal or near—optimal conserved
active modules in our model. We apply our algorithm to understand the mechanisms underlying
Th17 T cell differentiation in both mouse and human. As a main biological result, we find that the
key regulation of Th17 differentiation is conserved between human and mouse.

Availability and implementation: xHeinz, an implementation of our algorithm, as well as all input
data and results, are available at http://software.cwi.nI/xheinz and as a Galaxy service at http://services.

otherwise. The objective function (1) uses these variables to express
the activity of the solution, which we aim to maximize. Variables m
E {0,1}V1UV2 encode the presence of conserved nodes in the solu—
tion. Constraints (2) encode that a node 14 6 V1 that is present in the
solution (xM: 1) is conserved if there exists a related node U 6 V2
(1w 6 R) that is also present in the solution (x1, : 1). Similarly, con—
straints (3) define conserved nodes in V2 that are present in the solu—
tion. The fraction of conserved nodes in the solution is at least at as
captured by Constraint (4). In addition, we satisfy the modularity
property by requiring in Constraint (5) that G1[x] and Gzlx] are con—
nected. In Supplementary Text A.1 we give further details on how to
model Constraints (2), (3) and (5) as linear inequalities and on the
implementation that solves this formulation.

3 Material and methods

3.1 Experimental procedure

We summarize here the experimental procedure followed by
Tuomela et al. (2012) and Yosef et al. (2013) to generate transcrip—
tomic profiles. In (Tuomela et al., 2012), CD4 +T—cells were iso—
lated from umbilical cord blood of several healthy neonates,
arranged in three different pools, then activated with anti—CD3
and anti—CD28. Cells from each pool were then divided in two
batches, one to be polarized toward Th17 direction, and one serv—
ing as control (Th0). Th17 differentiating cytokines consisted of
IL6 (20ng/mL), IL1B (10ng/mL) and TGFB (10ng/mL), along
with neutralizing anti—IFNG (1 ,ug/mL) and anti—IL4 (1 ug/mL).
Three biological replicates of human cells, for both conditions
(coming from each pool), were collected between 0.5 and 72h
(0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72h time points) and hybridized on
Illumina Sentrix HumanHT—12 Expression BeadChip Version 3.
The microarray data were analyzed using the beadarray
Bioconductor package (Dunning et al., 2007). In (Yosef et al.,
2013), CD4+T—cells were purified from spleen and lymph nodes
from wild type C57BL/6 mice, then activated with anti—CD3 and
anti—CD28. For Th17 differentiation, cells were cultured with
TGFB (2 ng/mL), IL6 (20 ng/mL), IL23 (20 ng/mL) and IL1B
(20 ng/mL) during 0.5—72h (at time points 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10,
12, 16, 20, 24, 30, 42, 48, 50, 52, 60, 72 h), and finally hybridized
on an Affymetrix HT_MG—430 A.

3.2 Microarray processing, statistical analysis and node

scoring

Preprocessed and quantile normalized data sets were downloaded
from GEO under the accession numbers GSE43955 and GSE35103.
As downloaded from GEO, both the human and the mouse time—ser—
ies were already filtered by retaining only the probes with detection
P—values < 0.05 in at least one time point and one condition.
Following the original studies, we further only retained probes hav—
ing a standard deviation > 0.15 over all the conditions and time
points; as well as being annotated by a single ENSEMBL gene.
Finally, a single probe was selected for each gene by taking, for each
ENSEMBL gene, the probe having the largest variance accross all
samples. In total, 12 307 and 18 497 probes passed the filters for the
mouse and human data set, respectively.

Differential expression between Th17 and Th0 conditions were
estimated using the limma package (Smyth, 2005). Human samples
were indicated as paired according to the experimental design so as
to account for the pooled human samples. For mouse samples, call—
ing was performed on all Th0 versus Th17 samples, regardless of the
mouse donor. To determine which genes were differentially

expressed at a given time point, we used a linear model to estimate
the interaction between the treatment and the time effect. The linear
models used for the human and mouse studies include one inter—
action term for each time point and exclude the intercept (In R, the
formula reads: ~ 0+treat : time). Differential expression at any
time point K of interest were determined by the contrasts
Th17.timeK —Th0.timeK. We report in this study results for the fol—
lowing time points: 2, 4, 24, 48, 72 h.

Following (Dittrich et al., 2008), we computed positive and
negative scores for each gene at each time point by fitting a beta—uni—
form mixture model using the implementation in the BioNet pack—
age (Beisser et al., 2010). For a detailed description of this
procedure, see Supplementary Text A.2. Throughout this study,
FDR : 0.1 was used for all samples and species.

Due to the experimental noise and paired design, the human
samples have much higher intra—group variance, resulting in signifi—
cant calls having p—values orders of magnitude higher than the
mouse calls. This results in a range of scores that is much narrower
for human than for mouse, possibly imbalancing results towards
mouse modules. To correct for this effect, scores of mouse genes
were rank normalized to the scores of the human genes as follows:
the scores were sorted, and for each gene the score of the ith mouse
gene was set to the score of the ith human gene. Comparison of the
distribution of scores before and after normalization showed that
compared to usual Benjamini—Hochberg FDR and log fold change
cut—offs (Ilog FCIZl), the loss in statistical power was inconsequen—
tial and that this procedure ensured that mouse and human genes
had comparable score distributions.

3.3 Network and orthology databases
The human and mouse background networks were downloaded
from STRING v9.1, protein.actions.detailed.v9.1.txt (Franceschini
et al., 2013), which is a database that contains experimentally veri—
fied direct protein interactions. Note that this network also contains
interactions predicted based on orthology, so—called interologs.
Ideally, we would prefer to use only experimentally predicted inter—
actions, but currently, for mouse, such available data is too incom—
plete to result in a meaningful background network. Outlier nodes
with a degree above 40 times the interquartile range plus the 75th
percentile of the distribution of all node degrees were removed
(ELAVL1, UBC, Ubb, ch). The resulting mouse network has
16 821 nodes and 483 532 edges and the human network has 16 255
nodes and 315 442 edges.

Orthology information was downloaded from Ensembl release
59 (Flicek et al., 2013) and all human and mouse orthologs were
kept, regardless of the identity scores. The orthology mapping cor—
responds to a bipartite graph involving 67304 human proteins and
43 953 mouse proteins linked by 104 007 edges, grouped in 16552
bicliques with an average size of 6.72 proteins (SD: 5.34).

3.4 Implementation, input and output
xHeinz is implemented in modern C++, using the boost libraries
and the LEMON graph library (Dezsb’ et al., 2011). CPLEX 12.6 is
used to solve the ILP. The source code is publicly available in a git
repository linked to from http://software.cwi.nl/xheinz.

xHeinz takes as input (i) two species—specific networks, (ii) an
orthology mapping between the nodes of the two networks, (iii)
scores associated to each of the nodes, e.g. derived from the P—value
of the moderated t—test, (iv) the threshold value or and (v) an optional
time limit.

(Ruan et al., 2010). We also observe the conserved down-regulation
of GATA3/Gata3, which is known to be the master regulator of Th2
cells (Zheng and Flavell, 1997), and is likely to constrain the Th17
regulation program (van Hamburg et al., 2008). Similarly to the
modules found at 2 h, the 48 h modules are centered around STAT3,
although at the 48 h time point this gene is not differentially
expressed anymore neither in human or mouse (resp. logFC of 0.17,
score of —4.59 for human, and logFC 0.52, score of —3.21 for
mouse). This observation is in line with the major role of STAT3
along the differentiation process at all time points (Yosef et al.,
2013). To the contrary, STAT1 has been indicated as an exclusively
early regulator (Yosef et al., 2013) in mouse and is indeed not pre-
sent anymore in the 48 h modules. We also observe the presence of
the RORA/RORC/Rora/Rorc members of the RORs family of intra-
cellular transcription factors, which are considered to be the master
regulators of the Th17 lineage (Yang et al., 2008), and have been
implicated in both species (Crome et al., 2009). Interestingly, these
regulators are linked to the up-regulation of the vitamin-D receptor
(VDR/Vdr), whose role in Th17 differentiation and several human
auto-immune related disease have been recently studied (Chang
et al., 2010).

In summary, our findings show the relevance of the identified
conserved active modules with regard to the biological process of
interest. By requiring the active modules to contain a certain
fraction of conserved nodes, xHeinz identifies the main core pro-
teins involved in the differentiation of Th17. Our analysis con-
firms that these proteins are very likely to have similar roles in
both species.

4.3 Comparison to neXus

We compare the 48 h xHeinz modules (cf. Fig. 4) with subnetworks
computed by neXus version 3 (Deshpande et al., 2010). neXus uses
a heuristic technique to grow subnetworks from seed nodes simul-
taneously in two species. This is done in an iterative fashion.
Neighborhoods of the two current modules are determined using a
depth-first search. This search is restricted to only consider nodes
that have a path to the seed node with a confidence larger than the
user-specified parameter dfscutoff. The confidence of a path is
defined as the product of the confidences of the edges comprising
that path. The modules are extended to include the most active pair
of orthologous nodes in the neighborhoods—where activity is
defined as normalized log fold change and thus differs from the
definition of activity used in xHeinz. This whole procedure is
repeated until either the cluster coefficient drops below the user-
specified parameter cc, or the average activity scores of one of the
two modules drops below parameter scorecutoff. We ran neXus
with the default parameters cc:0:1, 0:2, scorecutoff:0:15
and dfscutoff : 0:3, 0:8 for mouse and human respectively for all
time points. Table 1 gives the resulting module sizes for human and
mouse.

Table 1. Modules calculated with neXus for all time points

neXus finds 1 module for time point 48h which is shown in
Figure 5 for human (A) and mouse (B). In total 5 genes are contained
in the module, which are identical for human and mouse, but the
number of edges differs. Only one of the genes is significantly differ-
entially expressed, CCL20, which has an absolute log fold change
bigger than 1 and a BH FDR smaller than 0.1. Since neXus does not
use p-values as an input, but log fold-changes which are normalized
to activity values, the genes CCL20 and CXCR3 are considered as
active nodes with a value above 0.15. These genes show changes in
expression, but only two of these changes are statistically significant.
The low number of active nodes points to a drawback in the neXus
algorithm: due to the locality of the greedy search strategy it may
happen that the average activity of the subnetwork in construction
keeps on degrading without reaching the next active node. The
effects of this issue can be seen, for example, in Figure 5, where
CCL20 is the seed node and the majority of other neighboring nodes
are not differentially expressed.

Another consequence of the neXus search strategy is that the
module sizes are small (cf. Table 1) and thus only give a limited view
of the molecular mechanisms at play. Theoretically, the parameter
dfscutoff can be decreased to increase the module size. Doing so,
however, produces only slightly larger modules, but drastically
increases the running time (Supplementary Table 51). Changes in
the clustering coefficient parameter cc only reduce the module size
with increasing cc (Supplementary Table 52).

Conservation in neXus is enforced stringently by only allowing
pairs of orthologous genes or genes that are only present in one of
the networks to be included in the subnetworks (see Fig. 5). This is
too restrictive if the underlying mechanisms in the two species differ.
For instance, for time point 48h and all but or: 1 values, xHeinz
finds the non-conserved gene IL23R (BH FDR 3.52 e—8, score
14.50, logFC 1.38) in human, which is involved in Th17 autocrine
signaling (Wei et al., 2007) but which is not differentially expressed
in mouse. xHeinz also finds JUNE, which at the 2h time point is
up-regulated in human data (BH FDR 1 e—2, score 0.02, logFC 1.3)
and not detected as differentially expressed in the mouse data (BH

FDR 0.48, score —4.01, logFC 0.65). JUNB is a known partner of
BATF with which it heterodimerizes preferentially during Th17 dif—
ferentiation (Sehraml et al., 2009), indicating its relevance. Both
important genes would have been missed by a more restrictive con—
servation setting. Indeed, both neXus and xHeinz at 51:1 fail to
find these genes showing that a more flexible view on conservation
is required to adequately deal with transferability.

5 Conclusion

We introduce a mathematical model for the problem of finding
active subnetwork modules that are conserved between two species
and thus contribute to formalizing the notion of conserved active
modules. A key feature of our model is a flexible notion of conserva—
tion, which is controlled by a parameter a E [0.1]: We require that
at least a fraction 01 of the nodes are conserved between the species—
specific modules of a solution. Note that in case of more distantly—
related species a smaller at value may be more appropriate. We have
translated our model into an integer linear programming formula—
tion and have devised and implemented an exact branch—and—cut
algorithm that computes provably optimal or near—optimal con—
served active modules in our model.

Our computational experiments for understanding the mechan—
isms underlying Th17 T cell differentiation in both mouse and
human demonstrate that the flexibility in the definition of conserva—
tion is crucial for the computation of meaningful conserved active
modules. We have found two conserved Th17 modules at time
points 2h (5: : 0.8) and 48h (a : 0.8) that thoroughly encompass
the biphasic Th17 differentiation process. This result can not be
revealed by requiring full conservation (a: 1) or by independent
modules without requiring conservation (a : 0). Likewise, neXus,
an alternative approach based on a stringent conservation model, is
not able to capture the key regulatory program of the differentiation
process.

A key characteristics of our model is its flexibility. This allows
its extension to multiple species and time points, which we will
address in future work. In this case, however, realistic instances will
be harder to compute to optimality and will require the development
of powerful algorithm engineering techniques.

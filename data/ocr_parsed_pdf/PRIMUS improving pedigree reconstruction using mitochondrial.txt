Abstract

Summary: PRIMUS is a pedigree reconstruction algorithm that uses estimates of genome—wide
identity by descent to reconstruct pedigrees consistent with observed genetic data. However, when
genetic data for individuals within a pedigree are missing, often multiple pedigrees can be recon—
structed that fit the data. We report a major expansion of PRIMUS that uses mitochondrial
(mtDNA) and non—recombining Y chromosome (NRY) haplotypes to eliminate many pedigree
structures that are inconsistent with the genetic data. We demonstrate that discordances in mtDNA
and NRY haplotypes substantially reduce the number of potential pedigrees, and often lead to the

identification of the correct pedigree.

Availability and Implementation: We have implemented PRIMUS updates in PERL and it is avail—

able at primus.gs.washington.edu.

1 Introduction

Correctly determining pedigree structures is key to identifying the
causes of genetic disorders (Riordan et (11., 1989). In some cases, re—
ported pedigree structures are inconsistent with observed genetic
sharing (Kerr et (11., 2013), which may result in a loss of power and
failure to find the disease causing variant(s) (Boehnke and Cox,
1997). Cryptic relatedness within datasets and sample swaps are fre—
quently observed. Pedigree reconstruction can find cryptic relation—
ships and correctly fit them into a pedigree structure (Staples et al.,
2014). Early methods for checking pedigrees applied pairwise rela—
tionship prediction approaches that use co—dominant genetic
markers (Epstein et (11., 2000; Sun et (11., 2002); however, pedigree
reconstruction can more accurately predict relationships, find the
correct pedigree, and identify cryptic pedigrees (Staples et (11., 2014).

Pedigree Reconstruction and Identification of a Maximum
Unrelated Set (PRIMUS; Staples et (11., 2014) uses estimates of
genome—wide identity by descent (IBD) to reconstruct pedigree
structures that fit the IBD estimates.

Missing genetic data for a set of people in a family often leads to
the identification of multiple pedigrees that fit the data. We show
that by using inconsistencies in the inheritance patterns of the
human mitochondria (mtDNA) and non—recombining Y chromo—
some (NRY) haplotypes captured by genotyping arrays or by high—
throughput sequencing (Lippold et (11., 2014), improves the accuracy
of pedigree reconstruction. We describe the utilization of mtDNA
and NRY data for pedigree reconstruction in PRIMUS (v1.8.0) to
reduce the number of generated pedigrees and improve the chance
of identifying the correct pedigree structure.

2 Methods

2.1 Identifying discordant mtDNA and NRY haplotypes
PRIMUS supports standard PLINK format. Human NRY and
mtDNA can be encoded as chromosome 24 and 26, respectively.
For a pair of individuals, PRIMUS calculates the concordance of
mtDNA and NRY haplotypes. The percent concordance of a haplo—
type is calculated as the percentage of matching mtDNA and NRY
nucleotide positions across the total number of variable mtDNA and
NRY positions and excludes positions with missing calls. A ‘discord—
ant’ prediction between the NRY or mtDNA haplotype of two
individuals occurs when concordance is below a user definable cut—
off (a 99% default works well for many datasets), otherwise the
NRY or mtDNA haplotype is predicted to be ‘concordant.’
Discordant status indicates that a pair of individuals has not co—
inherited the mtDNA or NRY haplotypes from a recent common
ancestor. Therefore, PRIMUS eliminates any pedigree structure
in which two individuals with discordant mtDNA or NRY
haplotypes shares a recent common maternal or paternal lineage,
respectively.

By default, PRIMUS only eliminates pedigree structures that are
inconsistent with the discordant mtDNA and NRY predictions, which
we demonstrate are very informative and reliable. For example, in
both sequencing and genotyping datasets, we observed a nearly 100%
haplotype concordance between individuals who have inherited
mtDNA or NRY from a recent common ancestor (i.e. fewer than four
generations of separation; Supplemental Table S1); therefore, individ—
uals with discordant predictions are very unlikely to be related
through a recent common ancestor of the sex that corresponds to the
discordant mtDNA or NRY prediction.

Although discordant mtDNA and NRY haplotypes are very use—
ful in rejecting genetically inconsistent pedigrees, concordant haplo—
types are less so. Because recombination does not inﬂuence mtDNA
and NRY haplotypes, a single haplotype can be passed unchanged
through a family for generations. Therefore, distant relatives can
have concordant mtDNA and NRY haplotypes while they share lit—
tle or no autosomal DNA with detectable IBD (Supplemental Fig.
S1). If PRIMUS requires all concordant mtDNA and NRY predic—
tions to be represented by a recent common ancestor, then distant,
concordant ancestral mtDNA and NRY haplotypes can cause
PRIMUS to reject the correct pedigree structure. Therefore, by de—
fault concordant mtDNA and NRY haplotypes are not used to rule
out pedigree structures.

2.2 mtDNA and NRY checking

PRIMUS uses mtDNA and NRY discordance to improve pedigree
reconstructions by checking whether the discordance is consistent
with the expected mtDNA and NRY inheritance patterns within the
pedigree. For example, if half—siblings are genotyped and have dis—
cordant mtDNA prediction, then their parent in common must be
the father. To check whether this discordant prediction is consistent
with a pedigree structure, PRIMUS finds the shortest first—
degree—relative inheritance path connecting two individuals, A and
B. Discordant predictions require an interruption in the transmission
of the haplotype in the pedigree. For example, if A and B are males
and have a discordant NRY, then there must be a female in the in—
heritance path connecting A and B. The logic that applies to NRY
inheritance paths through males applies to mtDNA inheritance
paths through females, except that the sex of A and B does not mat—
ter unless one is the direct ancestor of the other; in which case, the
direct ancestor must be female. We illustrate valid and invalid inher—
itance paths in a pedigree in Supplemental Figure S2.

3 Results

PRIMUS is the current state—of—the—art program for reconstructing
pedigrees and is the only program that lists all non—inbred pedigree
structures that fit genetic data using up to 3rd degree relationships.
To illustrate the use of mtDNA and NRY haplotypes during pedi—
gree reconstruction, we compare reconstructions by PRIMUS with
and without mtDNA and NRY haplotypes with simulated and real
data. We modified the pedigree simulations described by Staples
et al. (2014), to explore the effects of using mtDNA and NRY on
the reconstruction of pedigrees with different structures, genotypes
and combinations of missing samples. We selected pedigrees of size
20 and masked the genotypes for 0—50% of individuals in the pedi—
gree. We modified the simulations by permuting the sex of the indi—
viduals, while maintaining the biologic integrity of the pedigree. For
each simulation, we assigned a unique NRY haplotype to each male
founder and a unique mtDNA haplotype to all founders and propa—
gated these genotypes through the pedigree. We obtained mtDNA
and NRY haplotypes from the phase 1 release of unrelated CEU and
TSI haplotypes (Staples et (11., 2013) with individual—level call rates
>90% from the 1000 Genomes Project (Genomes Project, et (11.,
2012). These haplotypes consisted of 2832 mtDNA and 8665 NRY
loci with quality score 230, call rates >95%, and with a minor
allele frequency >1% for inclusion. We randomly assigned a unique
haplotype to each of the founders in each pedigree and propagated
the haplotypes through the pedigrees.

We considered pedigree reconstruction performance on the auto—
somal data alone as the baseline and compared this to the perform—
ance when we added additional information such as sex status,
mtDNA, and NRY. We see a moderate reduction in the number of
possible pedigrees with mtDNA and NRY individually, but the syn—
ergistic effects of mtDNA and NRY with sex status exceeded the
combined individual improvements (Fig. 1). Our results show the

tained when mtDNA, NRY and sex status are combined, eliminating nearly
40% of the incorrect pedigrees

largest improvement in pedigrees with more missing samples (35—
40%), where a 37% reduction in the mean number of genetically
consistent pedigrees is seen (Fig. 1). The improvement declines be—
yond 40% missing samples because the pedigrees become too sparse
for the discordant mtDNA and NRY haplotypes to rule out possible
pedigrees. We also see a substantial improvement in ranking the cor—
rect pedigree structure (Supplemental Fig. S3). In fact, when
mtDNA and NRY are combined with individual sex status, we see a
4.5—fold increase over sex status alone in the number of simulations
that reconstructed to the only true pedigree.

The improvements in pedigree specificity using mtDNA and
NRY genotypes are remarkable. As shown in Supplemental Figure
S4, a pedigree that reconstructed to 58 possible pedigrees using
autosomal DNA and sex status, resolved to the single correct pedi—
gree with the addition of mtDNA data. The new implementation of
PRIMUS identified this pedigree by eliminating the 57 pedigrees
that were inconsistent with the mtDNA data.

We validated our results on real data by reconstructing the pedi—
grees within the Jackson Heart Study (IHS) cohort. We received
Illumina Infinium HumanExome BeadChip genotype data for 2790
individuals. We estimated IBD proportions for these individuals
using the method described in Staples et al. (2014). After cleaning
(Supplemental Methods), there were 23 500 autosomal SNPs used
for the IBD calculation, and 126 NRY SNPs and 172 mtDNA SNPs
used for haplotype comparison. Using PRIMUS, we reconstructed
the IHS pedigrees with and without mtDNA/NRY haplotype data.
Inclusion of the mtDNA/NRY haplotypes reduced the number of
pedigrees generated for the IHS family networks. We saw up to a
67% reduction in the number of generated pedigrees (Supplemental
Fig. S5), with an average reduction of 18%. This improvement of
specificity did not negatively impact sensitivity; PRIMUS with
mtDNA and NRY identified the expected pedigrees at the same rate
as PRIMUS without mtDNA and NRY. These results fall well
within the range of improvement we saw in simulations with 1000
Genomes data. Therefore, with both simulated and real data, NRY
and mtDNA provide a substantial improvement in automated pedi—
gree reconstruction.

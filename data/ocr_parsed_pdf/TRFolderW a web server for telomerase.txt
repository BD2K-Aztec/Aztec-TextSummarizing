3 INTERFACE FEATURES

Users can use either text—based input or local ﬁle uploading to
submit their dataset. Since users may not have training data, we
organized parameter settings into two panels to avoid confusion.
The basic panel provides a set of parameters optimized to predict
all known TR structure in yeast, which could also be subse—
quently applied to other species. Since the template position is
also usually unknown, the panel allows users to optionally search
boundary element and core closing stem. The default stem—loop
scan window size and logodds matrices were trained from known
TR structures. The advanced panel can be used by users who
have training data. Using modiﬁed settings, the prediction result
can be significantly changed. After submission of data,
TRFolder—W will display an estimate of the running time used
in the searching process and redirect to a result page once the
search is done. It also gives an explicit URL to the result page
that the user can check back for search results. The folding struc—
tures make use of bracket view which is commonly used in RNA
folding. For each query sequence, the top 10 scored candidates
will be listed by default and the user can select a different
number.

4 PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

TRFolder—W successfully conﬁrmed TR structures of
Saccharomyces and Kluyveromyces which have been published.
To date, TRs of ﬁve Saccharomyces and Kluyveromyces (Lin
et al., 2004; Shefer et al., 2007; Tzfati et al., 2000) that are
Kluyveromyces lactis, Kluyveromyces dobzhanskii, Kluyveromyces
aestuarii, Kluyveromyces nonfermentans, Kluyveromyces wicker—
hamii, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces kudriavzevii,
Saccharomyces cariocanus, Saccharomyces paradoxus and
Saccharomyces mikatas have been proposed in multiple litera—
tures. Except for K. wickerhamii which has a different stem 1
of the pseudoknot, TRFolder—W is capable of predicting highly
similar TR core structures to published ones. The minor vari—
ances are mainly attributed to published structures having many
non—canonical base pairs such as U—U and bulges. These limita—
tions might be overcome by simply increasing the number of
training data.

In addition to verifying published TRs, TRFolder—W was
applied to predict TR structures for six novel yeast species,
which are Candida glabrata, Ashbya gossypii, Candida albicans,
Candida guilliermondii, Pichia stipitis and Delphinium hansenii. In
most of these species, the TR genes recently identified by
Gunisova et al. (2009) were also confirmed by our independent
analysis. The typical signals of potentially correct TR structures
consist of pseudoknot candidates close to putative templates,
good stem—loop structures and TR core structures within the
range of TR genes. Using TRFolder—W, we were able to identify
template—close pseudoknot candidates in C. albicans, A. gossypii,
P. stipiti and D. hansenii, all of which have long stem—loop for

TR core structures. In C. guilliermondii and C. albicans, the
structure predictions fall within the mapped genes. The pseudo—
knot and triple helix predicted in C. glabrata is highly similar to
those recently proposed by Kachouri—Lafond et a1. (2009).

TRFolder—W was used to predict TR core structures for a
novel yeast species Candida parapsilosis which was not included
in our previous studies (Guo et al., 2011). The telomerase RNA
gene sequence and telomeric repeat sequence for C. parapsilosis
have been available in the NCBI and Telomerase Database
(http://telomerase.asu.edu/) individually. TRFolder—W is able
to predict top ranked template—close pseudoknot, triple helix
and boundary element candidates, all of which have the
stem—loop structure and distance to template ﬁtting within the
length proﬁle deﬁned by published TR structures in
Saccharomyces and Kluyveromyces (Supplementary Table S1).
TRFolder—W also detected a core—closing stem candidate with
7bp stem length outside C. parapsilosis RNA gene by searching
its 2kb surrounding genome sequence.

As a model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans telomerase RNA
has not yet been reported. We used TRFolder—W on segments of
C. elegans DNA and found 11 potential telomerase RNA struc—
tures for the further experimental validation. This indicates
TRFolder—W may be applicable to species other than fungal
species to reduce a set of candidate telomerase RNA regions to
a smaller set.

TRFolder—W employs an exhaustive search approach in time
0( W3 N), where W is the size of the stem—loop scanning window
and N is the length of the sequence, to predict TR core struc—
tures. W is a parameter that can be set with a known range, but it
could be as long as N. Since this is computationally expensive
and time consuming, for each species, a 4kb RNA sequence cut
from the genome surrounding the template was usually used to
do test. TRFolder—W uses the features of TR structures to pro—
vide a means to identify TR genes and can be used as an alter—
native TR—specific structure prediction toolkit.

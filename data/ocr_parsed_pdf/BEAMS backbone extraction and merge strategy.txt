a formal combinatorial deﬁnition of the problem. We proceed
with proving its computational intractability even in a restricted
case. We next provide a general framework for the problem,
where we decompose the original problem into two subproblems,
that of backbone extraction and backbone merging. Informally,
each backbone in this framework corresponds to a closely related
central group of proteins, at most one from each network. Once
all the backbones are determined, the latter subproblem involves
merging together the backbones with higher chances of coexist—
ence in a cluster of orthologous proteins. We provide heuristic
methods for both subproblems that together form our proposed
algorithm based on backbone extraction and merge strategy,
BEAMS. We experimentally evaluate the algorithm with regards
to several biological signiﬁcance metrics proposed in literature
and compare it against one of the most popular global many—
to—many alignment methods, IsoRankN, and a recently proposed
state—of—the—art alignment algorithm, SMETANA. The experi—
mental results indicate that BEAMS alignments on real network
data provide more consistent clusters than those of IsoRankN
and SMETANA. Furthermore, considering the heavy computa—
tional load of the problem, the exceptional running time and
memory requirements of BEAMS is a further improvement
resulting from the provided framework and the algorithm.

2 METHODS AND ALGORITHMS
2.1 Problem definition

Although the one—to—one version of the problem has been
formally deﬁned in previous work, no formal combinatorial
deﬁnition exists for the global many—to—many version of the
interaction network alignment problem apart from parameter
learning—based definitions of Graemlin 2.0 (Flannick et al.,
2009), which actually is deﬁned as an intermediate subproblem
for local alignments. We ﬁrst provide a formally defined opti—
mization goal for the problem that captures the essence of the
informal deﬁnition provided in Section 1. The deﬁnition is based
on an intuitive generalization of the global one—to—one network
alignment problem deﬁnition provided in Singh et al. (2008) and
Aladag and Erten (2013).

Let G1(V1,E1), G2(V2,E2), . . .  be the input 
networks, where G,— corresponds to the ith PPI network and
V,~, E,~ denote, respectively, the node set (proteins) and the edge
set (interactions) of G. Let S indicate the edge—weighted complete
kipartite similarity graph where the ith partition of S is V,- and
each edge (u,v) in S is assigned a positive real weight w(u,v). This
weight corresponds to the sequence similarity score s(u,v) between
u and v, usually assumed to be the Basic Local Alignment Search
Tool (BLAST) bit score of u and v, where u e G,~, v e G] and
i5£j. Let Sﬁ be a subgraph of S with the same set of nodes. Sﬁ
represents a ﬁltered version of the similarity graph S, so that only
edges between pairs of proteins with relatively high sequence
similarity are retained. For a fixed S ﬂ, the global many—to—many
alignment of all the input PPI networks is the problem of
ﬁnding a maximal set of non—overlapping clusters
C£ = {Cl1, Cl2, . . . , Clm} that maximizes the following score:

2 1CQ(C1.~)
VClieCE

AS(C£) = a X CIQ(C£) + (1 — a) X lm

(1)

Here a is a real number between 0 and 1. It is a balancing
parameter that determines the contribution weight of network
topology as compared with homological similarity in the con—
struction of output alignments. Each cluster Cl,- is deﬁned to be a
complete cipartite subgraph of Sﬂ, where 1<c g k. A set of
clusters C£ is maximal if no additional clusters can be added
to Cﬁ, i.e. no further complete cipartite subgraph remains in
Sﬂ. Maximizing the AS score does not automatically guarantee
the maximality of the output set of clusters.

CIQ(C£) in the equation denotes cluster interaction quality and
is a measure of interaction conservation between all cluster pairs
in CL We deﬁne a conservation score, denoted with cs(m,n), for
each pair of clusters Clm, Cl". Let Emma” denote the set of all
PPI edges with endpoints in distinct clusters Clm, Cl". The score
cs(m,n) is trivially 0, if Emu“ C,” 2 (ll. Let st, denote the number
of PPI networks shared by the nodes in both Clm, Cl", and let
s9”, be the number of distinct PPI networks containing the edges
in Emma”. We assign cs(m, n) = 0 if s9“, = 1 and
cs(m, n) = s;n‘n/sm‘,, otherwise. The former assignment reﬂects
the fact that there is no interaction conservation between the
pair of clusters. The overall assignment is a generalization of
edge conservation deﬁnition of pairwise network alignments.
For pairwise alignments, edge conservation is assigned a binary
value, i.e. a PPI edge in one network is either conserved in the
other network or not. However, for multiple alignments the used
deﬁnition may assign rational conservation values; see Figure 1.

We formally define CIQ(C£) as follows:

E IEC/,,,.C/,,| >< cs(m, n)
VCIIIIICIII

Z IEC/W Clul
vcu. CL,

CIQ(C£) = (2)

In Equation (1), ICQ(Cl,~) stands for the internal cluster quality
of a given cluster Cl,- and is a measure of sequence similarities of
involved proteins. Let wmm.(u) denote the maximum weight of
any edge incident on u in Sﬂ. Denote the Sﬂ edges incident on
nodes in Cl,- with E(Cl,~). ICQ(Cl,~) is deﬁned as follows:

E w(u, 1/)2
V wlmu (W X wlmu (U)

vol. u)eE(Cl,-)

ICQ(CZ,~) = may

2.2 The BEAMS algorithm

We first show that for a ﬁxed S ﬂ, the global many—to—many net—
work alignment problem is computationally intractable. Owing
to space considerations we leave the proof to the Supplementary
Document.

PROPOSITION 2.1. For all a 75 0, the global many—to—many align—
ment problem is NP—hard even for the restricted case where two
PPI networks are aligned and all edge weights in S ’5 are equal.

Considering this NP—hardness result, it is necessary to devise
efﬁcient heuristics for the problem. The general approach of the
BEAMS algorithm can be described within the seed—and—extend
framework. Several previous network alignment studies are also
based on the same broad framework (Kuchaiev and Priulj, 2011;
Shih and Parthasarathy, 2012). However, how the seeds are

2.2.4 Backbone merging With regards to the second main
step of the BEAMS algorithm, we ﬁrst state the following prop—
osition about the computational complexity of the corresponding
problem. The full proof can be found in the Supplementary
Document.

PROPOSITION 2.3. For all values of a 75 0, the backbone merging
problem is NP—hard even for the case where there are two input
networks and all edge weights in S ’5 are equal.

We provide an iterative greedy heuristic for the backbone
merging step. Let MB denote the set of mergeable backbone
groups. Initially MB contains all backbones provided by the
ﬁrst backbone extraction step. It is updated at every iteration
of the algorithm by a greedy selection strategy which, similar to
the backbone extraction step, uses a candidate generation and
selection idea. At each iteration, we construct all pairs of merge—
able groups in MB that all together provide the set of all candi—
dates of that iteration. For each candidate, we compute the AS
score of MB considering the candidate pair as a single group.
Some groups in MB may consist of a single node. Such groups
are excluded from the AS score computations. We then select the
candidate that provides the maximum score and update MB by
merging the pair. The algorithm stops when no mergeable pair
remains that provides a minimal set MB. We ﬁnally remove
groups with a single node and provide the resulting set as the
output set of clusters. A full discussion of several implementation
details regarding this step and the algorithm as a whole are left to
the Supplementary Document.

3 DISCUSSION OF RESULTS

We implemented the BEAMS algorithm in C++ using the
LEDA library (Mehlhorn and Naher, 1999). The complete
source code, evaluation tools, all the data and output results
are available as part of the Supplementary Material. Two algo—
rithms we compare BEAMS against are IsoRankN and
SMETANA. IsoRankN is one of the most popular algorithms
in the global many—to—many network alignment literature. It
has been shown that compared with other popular alignment
algorithms, such as Graemlin 2.0, NetworkBLAST—M and
MI—GRAAL, it provides better performance under measures
suitable for network alignment quality determination (Liao
et al., 2009; Sahraeian and Yoon, 2012). Furthermore, the infor—
mal optimization goals of both IsoRankN and the BEAMS
algorithms are similar in the sense that they both aim at max—
imizing a suitable optimization scoring function that balances the
contribution of homological similarities of clustered proteins and
the edge conservation between pairs of clusters via a suitably
assigned constant a. Therefore, IsoRankN is one of the algo—
rithms that we extensively compare the BEAMS algorithm
against. A second alignment algorithm that we use in our experi—
mental evaluations is SMETANA (Sahraeian and Yoon, 2013), a
recent approach proposed for probabilistic many—to—many align—
ment of multiple networks. We present the experimental results
of BEAMS and IsoRankN for different values of a varying from
0.3 to 0.7 in the increments of 0.1. The BEAMS algorithm has an
additional user—deﬁned parameter B, the filtering ratio, which
is set to 0.4. Regarding the settings of parameters used by
SMETANA, we set nmaxz 10, ai*=0.9 and ﬂ*=0.8. These are

the settings used in the original article (Sahraeian and Yoon,
2013). Note that a* and ﬂ* do not correspond to a and ﬂ deﬁned
herein.

We experimented on both real and synthetic PPI networks.
Regarding the former, we present a discussion of the global
many—to—many alignment results for the PPI networks of five
extensively studied species: Caenorhabditis elegans (worm),
Drosophila melanogaster (ﬂy), Homo sapiens (human), Mus mus—
culus (mouse) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast). As input
data, the BEAMS algorithm requires the PPI networks and the
pairwise sequence similarity scores of aligned proteins. All these
data are retrieved from the IsoBase (Park et al., 2011) database,
which is the same as that used by the IsoRank, IsoRankN,
SPINAL and SMETANA algorithms. These PPI networks are
formed by combining the network data from various databases
including DIP (Salwinski et al., 2004), BIOGRID (Breitkreutz
et al., 2008), HPRD (Keshava Prasad et al., 2009), MINT (Ceol
et al., 2010) and IntAct (Aranda et al., 2010). The C.elegans
network has 19756 proteins and 4884 interactions, the
D.melanogaster network has 14098 proteins and 25 054 inter—
actions, the H.sapiens network has 22 369 proteins and 55168
interactions, the M.musculus network has 24855 proteins and
592 interactions, the S.cerevisiae network has 6659 proteins
and 82932 interactions and in total there are 87737 proteins
and 168630 interactions. Pairwise sequence similarity scores
correspond to the BLAST bit—values of the protein sequences
retrieved from Ensembl (Hubbard et al., 2009). With regards
to the experimental results on synthetic data, we used synthetic
PPI networks retrieved from the NAPAbench, which is a recently
proposed synthetically constructed network alignment bench—
mark (Sahraeian and Yoon, 2012). Owing to space consider—
ations, we present our experimental evaluations regarding these
synthetic networks in the Supplementary Document.

Later in the text we provide a detailed evaluation of the
alignment results produced by the three algorithms. In the next
subsection, we analyze the output alignments in terms of quan—
titative properties. Following this discussion, we next provide
an evaluation based on biological significance of the resulting
alignments.

3.1 Analysis of output clusters

Table 1 provides a summary of a quantitative analysis of the
alignments produced by the algorithms BEAMS, IsoRankN
and SMETANA. For a more detailed analysis, in addition to
the total coverage values provided by all the clusters, we also
provide a separate analysis by subdividing the output set based
on c, the number of networks represented in the clusters. The
ﬁrst four multirows provide these results for the instances of
c=2,3,4,5, respectively. The total coverage of BEAMS and
SMETANA are close, although that of SMETANA is slightly
larger. The clusters produced by the alignments of both algo—
rithms have far better total coverage than those of the
IsoRankN alignments; each algorithm aligns almost 50% more
proteins than IsoRankN. Considering the clusters as claimed
orthologies, this implies that BEAMS and SMETANA leave
out much less unexplained data by proposing orthology relations
for most of the proteins. The main reason behind this discrep—
ancy is the lack of IsoRankN clusters containing only proteins

Note: For the ﬁrst ﬁve multirows of the table, the top row corresponds to the number of generated clusters and the bottom row provides the total number of proteins in the
output clusters. The ﬁrst four multirows provide results for the instances of 13 = 2,3,4,5, respectively, where 1: denotes the number of networks in the clusters under consid—

eration. In each row, highest value is shown in bold.

from two networks. Such a deﬁciency may lead to unreasonable
conclusions, as it is natural to expect orthologous groups with
proteins from only two species given that the pairwise evolution—
ary distances of the species under consideration have large
variations.

The top row in the multirow indicated with Interactions pro—
vides the number of conserved interactions (CI) resulting from
the output alignments, the middle row indicates the total number
of interactions between clusters and the bottom row provides
their ratios. A PPI is assumed to be conserved if its cs score is
greater than zero, i.e. the interaction is between a pair of proteins
from different clusters that further contain at least one more pair
of interacting proteins from another PPI network. For all in—
stances of 01, the BEAMS algorithm provides more CI than
IsoRankN. Furthermore, this superiority is not simply due to
the large number of clusters produced by the BEAMS align—
ments; considering the ratio of the number of CI to the total
number of interactions between clusters, it can be observed
that the BEAMS alignments conserve a larger ratio of existing
edges between all clusters. SMETANA performs better than
BEAMS in terms of the number of CI. A reason that might
account for this result is the sizes of produced clusters; the aver—
age cluster size for SMETANA alignments is 4.36, whereas that
of BEAMS alignments is 3.90. An alignment with large cluster
sizes has a better chance in providing larger number of CI. In the
extreme case, simply subdividing the input networks into two
clusters through the maximum cut of the networks provides a
large interaction conservation even leading to 100% conserva—
tion ratio. On the other hand, larger cluster sizes may decrease
the I CQ score, intended to measure the internal cluster quality,

and thus the quality of the overall alignment. This becomes evi—
dent by inspecting the last row of the table that provides the AS
scores of the alignments as deﬁned in Equation (1). For each of
the corresponding values of 01 used in the AS deﬁnition, the
BEAMS alignments provide better results than both IsoRankN
and SMETANA alignments. We note that for SMETANA the
AS score provided in the table is computed under 01 : 0.3 setting.
The rest of the AS scores for SMETANA is 0.42, 0.36, 0.30, 0.24
and for 01 values is 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, respectively. Furthermore, as
noted in Sahraeian and Yoon (2013), simply comparing CI
counts may be misleading, unless the interaction conservations
are among orthologous groups. The next subsection provides a
measure denoted with C01 (conserved orthologous interactions ),
which takes this fact into account.

3.2 Evaluations based on biological signiﬁcance

Similar to previous PPI network alignment studies, our biolo—
gical significance evaluations are based on the hierarchical Gene
Ontology (GO) categorization, where proteins are annotated
with appropriate GO categories organized as a directed acyclic
graph (Ashburner et al., 2000). To standardize the GO annota—
tions of proteins, similar to the evaluation methods of Aladag
and Erten (2013), Liao et al. (2009) and Singh et al. (2008), we
restrict the protein annotations to level ﬁve of the GO directed
acyclic graph by ignoring the higher—level annotations and repla—
cing the deeper—level category annotations with their ancestors at
the restricted level. The protein annotations are used to measure
the consistency of generated clusters. A cluster is annotated if at
least two of its proteins are annotated by some GO categories.

Note: For the ﬁrst ﬁve multirows, the top row indicates the number of annotated clusters, the middle row provides the number of consistent clusters and the bottom row
indicates the ratio of consistent clusters to annotated clusters. The 13 values are the same as those in Table 1. In each row, best performance is shown in bold.

An annotated cluster is considered consistent if all of its proteins
share at least one common standard GO annotation. The con—
sistency evaluations of the BEAMS, IsoRankN and SMETANA
alignments are provided in the ﬁrst ﬁve multirows of Table 2.
The top row in each of these multirows indicates the number of
annotated clusters, the middle row provides the number of con—
sistent clusters and ﬁnally the bottom row indicates the ratio of
consistent clusters to annotated clusters. This ratio is called spe—
ciﬁcity in some previous alignment studies (Sahraeian and Yoon,
2012). Considering the complete set of annotated clusters, it is
clear that the BEAMS alignments outperform those of
IsoRankN and SMETANA in terms of the number of consistent
clusters. Furthermore, the aligned clusters of BEAMS are more
speciﬁc than those produced by IsoRankN and SMETANA.
To measure how sensitive the provided alignment results are,
we use the sensitivity deﬁnition as in Flannick et al. (2009).
Analogous to that deﬁnition, for a given GO category, let its
closest cluster denote the cluster that contains the maximum
number of proteins annotated with this GO category. The sen—
sitivity of an alignment is then deﬁned as the average, over all
GO categories, of the fraction of aligned nodes annotated with a
GO category that are also in its closest cluster. Correct nodes,
another measure that reﬂects sensitivity of an alignment

(Sahraeian and Yoon, 2012), are deﬁned as the total number
of annotated proteins in all the consistent clusters. In the corres—
ponding multirow, the top provides this number, whereas the
bottom provides the ratio of correct nodes to the number of
annotated nodes in the alignment. Additionally, we provide an
alternative metric to measure the correct nodes of an alignment
relative to an alternative alignment. An RCNCI value shown
under a BEAMS column provides the number of annotated
proteins in consistent clusters in a BEAMS alignment and in
inconsistent clusters in an IsoRankN alignment under the same
01 settings. The RCNCI value under an IsoRankN column pro—
vides the exact opposite. Similarly, RCNC2 measures analogous
relative correct node counts between BEAMS and SMETANA
alignments. We note that for SMETANA the RCNC2 score
provided in the table is relative to the BEAMS alignment with
01 : 0.3 setting. The rest of the scores for SMETANA relative to
the BEAMS alignments with 01:0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7 settings are
5330, 5332, 5400 and 5367, respectively. The BEAMS alignments
provide much better sensitivity, correct node counts and relative
correct node counts than those of IsoRankN and SMETANA.

Mean normalized entropy (MNE) is another consistency evalu—
ation metric used in previous studies (Liao et al., 2009; Sahraeian
and Yoon, 2012). The normalized entropy of an annotated cluster

the fraction of proteins in Clx with the annotation G0,, and d
represents the number of different GO annotations in Clx. For
MNE the sum of these values are averaged over the total number
of annotated clusters. Lower MNE values indicate better consist—
ency. Yet another consistency evaluation metric is G0 consistency
(GOC) deﬁned in Aladag and Erten (2013). Because GOC is
deﬁned for the one—to—one alignment of a pair of networks, we
extend the deﬁnition to many—to—many alignments of multiple
networks by normalizing the score. For an annotated cluster
Clx, let G0,~,,,(Clx) and G0um~(Cl\.) indicate, respectively, the inter—
section set of GO annotations of proteins in Clx and the union set
of GO annotations of all the proteins in Clx. The normalized
GOC score, nGOC, is deﬁned as the weighted mean of
|G0,~m|/|G0,m,~| over all annotated clusters, where the weight of
each cluster is the number of annotated proteins it contains. In
terms of better consistency larger nGOC values are desirable.
With respect to both metrics, MNE and nGOC, the BEAMS
algorithm clearly outperforms both IsoRankN and SMETANA.

Finally, as was noted at the end of the previous subsection, the
CI score by itself may not be a proper measure. It is important to
detect whether the provided interaction conservations are spuri—
ous or do actually correspond to real CI between orthologous
nodes. Similar to Sahraeian and Yoon (2013), we use the C01
measure for this purpose. For a given alignment, it represents
the number of CI between consistent clusters. The C0] scores of
IsoRankN and SMETANA are somewhat similar, whereas
BEAMS provides a noticeably large score. BEAMS provides
almost 1000 more CI between orthologous clusters than
IsoRankN and SMETANA. The COI/CI ratios may provide a
good clue as to the success of SMETANA in achieving large CI
score discussed in the previous subsection. The ratio is 48% for
BEAMS, whereas it is as low as 20% for SMETANA. This
indicates that SMETANA aggressively conserves interactions
at the expense of possible spurious conservation between non—
orthologous nodes.

In addition to these evaluation metrics, intended to measure
biological signiﬁcance of output alignments, we also provide a
speciﬁc clustering instance resulting from the alignments of
BEAMS, IsoRankN and SMETANA on the same dataset.
Owing to space requirements details regarding a discussion of
this alignment instance are provided in the Supplementary
Document.

3.3 Running time requirements

Let V denote the set of nodes in all the PPI networks, Am”
denote the maximum degree of any node in any of the input
PPI networks and ﬁnally let A denote the maximum degree in
Sﬂ. With the reasonable assumptions that Am“ : 0(A) and
|V| :0(Ak), the running time of BEAMS is bounded by
0(V2Ak+l). A formal running time analysis of the algorithm
can be found in the Supplementary Document. An important
advantage of BEAMS and SMETANA over IsoRankN is their
superb execution speed. For the IsoBase data experiments of this
section, IsoRankN required almost 40 h for execution comple—
tion on average. The time requirements of BEAMS and
SMETANA were similar. Both required almost half an
hour for completion under the same computational settings.

Furthermore, the memory requirements of BEAMS is much
better than those of SMETANA; the former requiring 2.5 Gb
for the experiments on the IsoBase data, whereas the latter
required almost 4.5 Gb on the same input. Details of all the
required CPU times can be found in the Supplementary
Document.

4 CONCLUSION

We provided a combinatorial optimization formulation for the
global many—to—many alignment of multiple PPI networks. We
showed that the problem is computationally intractable. Based
on the general seed—and—extend framework, we then provided a
novel heuristic, BEAMS for the problem. We compared the
BEAMS algorithm against two popular state—of—the—art algo—
rithms, IsoRankN and SMETANA. Using the network data of
IsoBase, we showed that BEAMS outperforms both algorithms
with regards to several biological signiﬁcance metrics proposed
in literature. We note that in addition to the many—to—many
version of the network alignment problem, versions including
one—to—one and one—to—many have also been studied previously.
Owing to lack of standard criteria for evaluations of alignments
produced by different versions, it was out of the scope of the
current article to compare BEAMS against those algorithms
proposed for one—to—one or one—to—many alignments. Further
studies involving the design of evaluation criteria for various
alignment problem versions would enhance our understanding
of comparative biological network analysis.

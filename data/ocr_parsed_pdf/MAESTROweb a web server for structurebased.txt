Abstract

Summary: The prediction ofchange in stability upon point mutations in proteins has many applica—
tions in protein analysis and engineering. We recently adjoined a new structure—based method
called MAESTRO, which is distributed as command line program. We now provide access to
the most important features of MAESTRO by an easy to use web service. MAESTROweb allows the
prediction of change in stability for user—defined mutations, provides a scan functionality for the
most (de)stabilizing n—point mutations for a maximum of n : 5, creates mutation sensitivity profiles
and evaluates potential disulfide bonds. MAESTROweb operates on monomers, multimers and
biological assemblies as defined by PDB.

Availability and implementation: MAESTROweb is freely available for non—commercial use at

1 Introduction

Point mutation can have a strong impact on protein stability. While in
biomedical research functional consequences are of particular interest,
in protein engineering often targeted stability changes are intended.
Different computational approaches to predict the change in stability
upon point mutations have been developed. Methods using the 3D
structure of the wild type protein, e.g. I-Mutant2.0 (Capriotti et (11.,
2005), PoPMuSiC (Dehouck et (11., 2009) or DUET (Pires et (11., 2014),
turned out to perform better than purely sequence-based approaches
(Khan and Vihinen, 2010) in general. However, the new sequence-
based method INPS (Fariselli et (11., 2015) closes this performance gap
for some datasets and is also able to complement and improve struc-
ture-based approaches. We recently introduced a novel structure-based
method called MAESTRO which has a similar or better accuracy than
the competitor methods (Laimer et (11., 2015). MAESTRO offers add-
itional benefits which are (i) report of a prediction confidence value, (ii)
operation on multimeric proteins, (iii) a scan mode for the most (de)sta-
bilizing 11-point mutations and (iv) evaluation of potential disulfide

bonds.

Here, we present MAESTROweb, which provides an easy to use
web interface to MAESTRO for the most frequent application

scenarios.

2 Features

MAESTROweb provides four experiment types. First, the investiga-
tion of user-specified mutations. The mutations sites and types can
be selected through menus or by flexible mutation syntax.

The second type of experiment is a scan for the most (de)stabiliz-
ing 11-point mutation (n S 5), which is useful for protein engineering
tasks. For n : 1, an optimal search is applied. For n > 1, a greedy
search or evolutionary algorithm (EA) is utilized.

Third, MAESTROweb offers the calculation of mutation sensi-
tivity profiles, where the impact of each mutation at each possible
position is visualized, similar to the PoPMuSiC web server
(Dehouck et (11., 2011). This allows the identification of cold or
hot spot sites, respectively, which are resistant or sensitive to
mutations.

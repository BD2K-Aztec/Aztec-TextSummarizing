Abstract

Motivation: Mutual exclusivity is a widely recognized property of many cancer drivers. Knowledge
about these relationships can provide important insights into cancer drivers, cancer—driving path—
ways and cancer subtypes. It can also be used to predict new functional interactions between can—
cer driving genes and uncover novel cancer drivers. Currently, most of mutual exclusivity analyses
are preformed focusing on a limited set of genes in part due to the computational cost required to
rigorously compute P—values.

Results: To reduce the computing cost and perform less restricted mutual exclusivity analysis, we
developed an efficient method to estimate P—values while controlling the mutation rates of individ—
ual patients and genes similar to the permutation test. A comprehensive mutual exclusivity
analysis allowed us to uncover mutually exclusive pairs, some of which may have relatively low
mutation rates. These pairs often included likely cancer drivers that have been missed in previous
analyses. More importantly, our results demonstrated that mutual exclusivity can also provide in—
formation that goes beyond the interactions between cancer drivers and can, for example, eluci—
date different mutagenic processes in different cancer groups. In particular, including frequently
mutated, long genes such as 'I'I'N in our analysis allowed us to observe interesting patterns of
APOBEC activity in breast cancer and identify a set of related driver genes that are highly predictive
of patient survival. In addition, we utilized our mutual exclusivity analysis in support of a previously
proposed model where APOBEC activity is the underlying process that causes TP53 mutations in a
subset of breast cancer cases.

gene pairs (i.e. gene pairs of which simultaneous mutations in the
same patients are less frequent than it is expected by chance) are
observed within many cancer types, while some are common across
multiple different cancer types (Kim et (11., 2015 ). The underlying

genes belong to the same cancer—driving pathway, then a mutation
in just one of them might suffice to dysregulate the pathway and
trigger cancer progression (Ciriello et (11., 2012; Hofree et (11., 2013;

Vogelstein and Kinzler, 2004). In contrast, in a combined analysis of
multiple cancer types, mutually exclusive aberrations might repre—
sent tissue specific cancer drivers. In fact, the sets of mutually exclu—
sive drivers obtained in Pan—Cancer analysis (Kandoth et (11., 2013;
Szczurek and Beerenwinkel, 2014) predominantly included the tis—
sue type specific genes that, typically, do not share common path—
ways. Yet, even within the same tissue type, mutual exclusivity
between genes from different pathways is not unusual (Kim et (11.,
2015). This type of exclusivity can be explained, for example, by
synthetic lethality where simultaneous mutations in both genes are
detrimental for cancer progression (Dwyer—Nield et (11., 2010; Wang
et (11., 2014). Another (not necessarily unrelated) possibility is that
the mutually exclusive drivers define different cancer subtypes
within the same tissue type. Finally, mutual exclusivity can also be
observed between less frequently mutated cancer drivers suggesting
more subtle relationships between them and their contribution to
cancer progression. For example, previous research found that even
if the exclusivity between ARID1B and KRAS is not significant in
any of individual cancer types separately, the pair was shown to be
mutually exclusive when analyzing all cancer types together as stat—
istical power was gained (Kim et (11., 2015).

Mutual exclusivity can potentially provide important informa—
tion about cancer, including its alternative progression pathways
and subtypes. It can also reveal important relationships between
genes and pathways. However, most of the analyses of mutual ex—
clusivity so far have been focused on limited subsets of genes that
were selected based on mutation rate cut—off (typically 3 or 5% de—
pending on datasets) or restricted by other criteria. One of the fac—
tors limiting the applications of mutual exclusivity analysis beyond
restricted gene sets was the cost of computing rigorous P—values for
all gene pairs of interest. Statistically, pairwise mutual exclusivity
can be estimated by a permutation test in which the original muta—
tional profile is permuted by swapping random pairs of mutations it—
eratively while preserving the mutation rates of genes and patients.
A possibly faster alternative approach is to use a hypergeometric
test. However, the hypergeometric test treats all patients equally,
ignoring patient specific mutation frequencies, which may limit its
accuracy.

To provide a more in—depth understanding of mutual exclusivity
in cancer data, we started by designing a new and fast heuristic for
estimating statistical significance of mutual exclusivity relationships.
Our method, Weighted Sampling based Mutual Exclusivity
(WeSME), estimates P—values of mutual exclusivity while taking
into account mutation frequencies of patients. It closely approxi—
mates the results of the permutation—based method and does so
without using the costly permutations of a mutation matrix.
Moreover, WeSME can compute P—values for a subset of genes inde—
pendently from the rest of genome unlike the permutation method
that requires whole genome permutations. By dynamically adjusting
sampling depth, WeSME can provide high precision P—values with—
out a significant increase in computational cost. Adopting the same
sampling technique, we also developed a complementary test,
Weighted Sampling based Co—Occurrence (WeSCO), to estimate the
significance of co—occurrence in gene mutations.

With WeSME at hand, we began to explore the information that
a comprehensive mutual exclusivity survey can provide. We
included all genes with mutations in the analysis without pre—
filtering. In particular, we did not exclude very long genes such as
muscle protein Titin (TTN), gel forming Mucins, which often
emerge as frequently mutated genes in cancer (even after correction
with their lengths) but are generally assumed to be artifacts
(Lawrence et (11., 2013). Interestingly, we found that some of these

genes have many mutual exclusivity partners. In particular, we iden—
tified TTN as one of the hubs in the mutual exclusivity network in
breast cancer and endometrial carcinoma. The high number of mu—
tual exclusivity partners of TTN prompted us to hypothesize that
mutual exclusivity of its mutations could be a reﬂection of an under—
lying mutagenic process that occurs in a specific subgroup of
patients.

To test this hypothesis, we reasoned that long and frequently
mutated genes might harbor a recognizable signature of the muta—
genic process acting on them. Specifically, it has been recently recog—
nized that a subclass of APOBEC cytidine deaminases, which
convert cytosine to uracil during RNA editing, are a source of muta—
genicity in human tumors (Burns et (11., 2013; Harris, 2015;
Lawrence et (11., 2013). Several other factors such as P01 8 mutation,
patient ages at diagnosis, known mutagenic exposures, or defects in
DNA maintenance are also associated with characteristic mutation
signatures (Alexandrov et (11., 2013). We found that, in the case of
breast cancer, the mutation pattern of TTN is consistent with the
APOBEC3B activity, while in endometrial carcinoma, it is consistent
with the P01 8 mutation signature.

Including TTN gene in our mutual exclusivity analysis allowed
us not only to observe interesting patterns of APOBEC activity in
breast cancer but also to identify a set of driver genes that is highly
predictive of patient survival. In addition, we showed that our mu—
tual exclusivity analysis supports the model where APOBEC activity
is the underlying process that causes TP5 3 mutations in highly
mutated breast cancer cases. Finally, with our method, we have been
able to uncover mutually exclusive cancer drivers and novel putative
drivers despite their relatively low mutation rates in the breast can—
cer dataset.

Taken together, our results demonstrated the utility of our fast
statistical test for mutual exclusivity and showed that the unre—
stricted analysis of mutual exclusivity enabled by the method can
provide valuable biological insights.

2 Method: WeSME

Both hypergeometric and permutation based methods have been
popular choices for estimating the significance of mutual exclusivity.
The drawback of the permutation—based method is the computa—
tional cost, thus limiting gene sets to be considered and/0r precision.
On the other hand, the hypergeometric test does not take into ac—
count different mutation frequencies of patients and often underesti—
mates the significance of exclusivity. WeSME aims to reduce the
computational cost of estimating the significance of mutual exclusiv—
ity by utilizing weighted samplings instead of performing costly per—
mutations of a mutation matrix, while accurately computing
P—values by including patient mutation frequency information in
sampling probability (see the discussion on the computational costs
in Supplementary Section S—A).

2.1 General description ofWeSME method

WeSME first computes the mutation frequencies of patients based
on the observed distribution (Fig. 1A and Algorithm 1 in
Supplementary Section S—E). Let G : {g1, g2. . .gm} and S: {51, $2 . . .
5"} be the set of all genes and cancer patients, respectively. Let mf(s)
be the observed mutation frequency of a patient 5. Next we obtain
the null distribution of the mutation pattern of a gene by performing
samplings of patients based on the weights (mf(s1), mf(52) . . . mf(s,,))
(Algorithm 2). Specifically, for a gene g in G with m(g) mutated pa—
tients, we randomly sample m( g) patients without replacement while

making sure that the probability of a patient 5 being sampled is pro—
portional to the observed mutation frequency mf(s) (i.e. sampling
weighted by mf(s)). Let (R;,R§, R3 . . . REV) denote the sampling re—
sults when W weighted samplings were performed for gene g. R;
corresponds to the random subset of patients for gene g in the lth
weighted sampling and the size of R; must be m(g) for all 1. Note
that the samplings depend only on m(g) and W, and therefore two
genes g1 and g2 with m(g1):m(g2) can reuse the same samplings. We
use this fact to further reduce the sampling time (see Section 2.2 and
Supplementary Section S—A).

To estimate the P—value of mutual exclusivity of two genes g, and
g, in G, we compare the number of patients exclusively covered by
the two genes and the numbers of such patients from the null distri—
bution (Algorithm 3). Formally, for two subsets of patients 5, and 5,,
let us define ExCover(Si, 5,) to be IXOR(S,, 51)). Suppose that S(g,-) is
the set of patients who have mutations in gene g,-. Then
ExCover(S(gi), S(g,-)) represents the exclusive cover size by either
gene g, or g. As in the permutation—based method, the empirical P—
value of mutual exclusivity of g, and gl- is given as

(ghgi) : I{l:1...W)ExCover(err Ki!)
> ExCover(S(gt)r 

where (R},R%,R? .  and (R},R72,R? . . .R/W) are the random
samplings of g, and g], respectively. We note that the precision of
P—values depends on the number of weighted sampling pairs W. In
Section 2.2, we discuss how we increase W to obtain a better preci—
sion without increasing the computational time significantly.

One noteworthy advantage of using WeSME over the permuta—
tion method is that except Algorithm 1, the analysis can be carried
out for a subset of genes independently from the rest of genome
whereas in the permutation method, the whole genome permuta—
tions need to be performed to obtain random profiles.

2.2 WeSME provides a fast and accurate approximation
to the permutation based method
In this section, we discuss some optimization techniques to further
reduce the computational costs of WeSME and present the results
applied to TCGA BRCA dataset.

tor (mf(s1), mf(52), . . . mf(s,,)) of patients, the weighted sampling of

a gene g depends only on the number of mutated patients m(g) and
the number of samplings W. Utilizing this fact, we ran Algorithm 2
for each different m(g) instead of running for each gene. More spe—
cifically, let K be {/2 I m( g) : k for some g}. We performed W
weighted samplings for each different [2 in K (denoted as WS(k)). As
discussed in Supplementary Section S—A, we found that it reduces
the sampling time and storage requirement significantly.

Dynamic depth of precision: Suppose that we run Algorithm 3
for two genes g, g. Let k,:m(gi) and lei: m(gj) and let
(Ri1,Ri2,Ri3 . . . RP”) and (R3312, R15 . . . Riw) denote the weighted ran—
dom samplings for k,- and [2,- respectively. Then there are at least
W(W — 1) different ways to create the pairs (discarding R5 and R]!
when kizki in which case R5 and R]! are identical) and compute
ExCover. For added randomness and optimizing the running time,
we started by randomly selecting a small number of pairs (W0) and
compute ExCover for them initially. For example, we start with
W0 :1000 pairs at first and if empirical P—value < 0.1 (there are less
than 100 random pairs whose ExCover is bigger than the original
ExCover), we increased the number of sampling pairs by 10 times to
obtain a better precision. The maximum precision we used in this
analysis is 10 T 6 (i.e. the maximum number of pairs :106 S W(W —
1))

Analysis of TCGA BRCA somatic mutations: we ran WeSME
with the somatic mutation profile of 665 TCGA BRCA patients. We
considered all genes with at least one mutation without pre—filtering
and computed the P—values of all gene pairs. Figure 2A shows the
comparison of the P—value distributions obtained by WesME, per—
mutation test and hypergeometric test for the gene pairs with their
P—values S 0.25. The P—values of the permutation—based method
were computed using 1000 randomly permuted mutation profiles
(permuted while preserving the mutation frequencies of patients and
the mutation rates of genes). We found that the results obtained
with WeSME approximate the ones with the permutation test very
well (relative error rate g 0.17, Pearson corr. coef. g 0.98) while the
hypergeometric test, in general, underestimates the mutual exclusiv—
ity (relative error rate g 0.97, Pearson corr. coef. g 0.89). We noted
that WeSME P—values tend to be slightly more significant than the
P—values based on the permutation test especially for the gene pairs
with significant P—values (see more discussion in Supplementary
Section S—B). Still WeSME approximates the permutation test much
better than the hypergeometric test for the significant gene pairs (for

cancer type. The widths of edges correspond to their WeSME P—values (thicker edges for more significant pairs) whereas darker colors of the edges correspond

to lower FDRs. The networks are created using Cytoscape (Shannon er al., 2003)

pairs with P—value S 0.05, relative error rate—0.30 versus 3.3,
Pearson corr. coef.—0.89 versus 0.76). This trend of over—
estimation was less prominent when we considered all gene pairs in
HumanNet (http://www.functionalnet.org/humannet/) (Fig. 2A in—
set, the whole spectrum of P—values are shown).

False discovery rate (FDR): in order to control FDR, we obtained
the null distribution by generating 100 permuted mutational profiles
and computing WeSME P—values for all gene pairs with the per—
muted mutations (Fig. 1B and Algorithm 4). Observing that the null
distribution of P—values showed different patterns depending on the
mutation rates of involved genes, we divided the genes into two
groups based on their mutation rates (highly or rarely mutated),
which in turn divided all gene pairs into three different bins. The
null distribution for each bin was created separately using the
P—values from the permuted mutation profiles. We then computed
the FDR of the P—value for the gene pairs in each bin by comparing

them with the null distribution for the corresponding bin. Figure 2B
shows the different FDRs obtained using three bins—(R, R), (R, H)
and (H, H) for BRCA where R (Rarely mutated) includes all genes
with the mutation rate of 2% or lower, and the remaining genes are
in H (Highly mutated). There were no pairs in bin (R, R) with
P—value S 0.25. In Figure 2B, we can observe that the pairs in bin (R,
H) have higher FDRs (shown in purple) than the pairs in bin (H, H)
(shown in cyan) for the same P—values.

2.3 Mutual exclusivity network in BRCA and UCEC

Figure 3A shows the network with significant mutually exclusive
(ME) edges created with BRCA somatic mutation profiles. We
included the gene pairs with P value 3 0.01 for highly mutated gene
pairs in (H, H) and applied a stricter P—value threshold of 0.001 for
pairs in (R, H). The corresponding FDR 3 0.125. We also computed
the ME network with TCGA endometrial carcinoma (UCEC)

WeSME: uncovering mutual exclusivity

 

somatic mutation data with a stricter FDR cut—off of 0.0025
(Fig. 3B). The more stringent FDR cutoff was used because the ana—
lysis of UCEC patients resulted in a larger number of ME pairs, pre—
sumably due to its partition into subtypes with drastically different
mutational profiles. Additional list of ME pairs with FDR g 0.01 is
included in Supplementary Section S—F. We also performed the ana—
lysis with TCGA Acute Myeloid Leukemia dataset and the resulting
ME network is shown in Supplementary Section S—D.

The BRCA network (Fig. 3A) contains 34 mutually exclusive
gene pairs. There were 13 pairs where one of the genes in the pair
was mutated in 3% or less patients including two pairs where the
mutation rate was below 2%. These genes would have been filtered
out if 3% of mutation rate threshold was applied. Interestingly,
these pairs include five pairs of well—known drivers: (ARID1A,
TP53), (MTOR, PIK3CA), (AKT1, PIK3CA), (AKT1, TP53),
(CTCF, TP53); four pairs where one member is a known cancer
driver and its partner is a likely (and previously implicated) cancer
driver: (TP53, MED23), (PIK3CA, PEG3)(Su et al., 1999), (CBFB,
TP53) (Banerji et al., 2012) (USP36, PIK3CA) (Sun et al., 2015);
and three pairs where one member is a long gene—Titin (TTN) or
Cytoplasmic Dynein 2 Heavy Chain (DYNC2H1)—while its partner
is a known cancer driver (TTN, ARID1A), (AKT1, TTN),
(DYNC2H1, PIK3CA). Previous work suggested that TTN and
DYNC2H1 are unlikely to be cancer drivers (Lawrence et al., 2014).
Yet, TTN has rather a large number of partners in the mutual exclu—
sivity network, suggesting that patients carrying mutations in this
gene may have some distinguishing properties.

As for endometrial carcinoma, the previous analysis on TCGA
UCEC dataset identified 12 genes (PTEN, TP53, PIK3CA, PIK3R1,
ARID1A, ARIDSB, KRAS, CTCF, CTNNBl, FBXW7, PPP2R1A,
RPL22) as recurrently mutated in different subtypes (Cancer
Genome Atlas Research et al., 2013). All but ARID5B and RPL22
are included in the ME network obtained with FDR cut—off of
0.0025. RPL22 and TP53 pair had FDR: 0.00256 while the most
significant ME partner of ARID5B was CTNNB1, for which
FDR: 0.02. Though overlooked in the TCGA publication, TRRAP
(transformation/transcription domain—associated protein) is likely to
be an important driver. The gene encodes a protein that plays a role
in transcription and DNA repair. With our very stringent FDR cut—
off, TRRAP is mutually exclusive with CTNNB1 and PIK3CA.
Finally, as in the case of BRCA, the TTN gene has four neighbors,
all of which are prominent cancer drivers.

In our subsequent analysis in Section 3, we show that although
TTN may not be a cancer driver itself, it is likely to be a passenger
of a mutagenic process that is specific to a subgroup of patients in
these two cancer types.

3 Results: beyond mutual exclusivity of drivers—
discovering driver signatures from mutual
exclusivity partners of passengers

3.1 APOBEC and POL s mutational signatures of 'I'I'N
Recent studies identified several genes that are highly mutated but
still unlikely to be cancer drivers (Lawrence et al., 2013). These
genes are often extremely long genes, including the muscle protein
Titin (TTN), gel forming mucins (MUC) and ryanodine receptors
(RYR1). Those genes were mostly excluded from candidate cancer
driver lists in subsequent analyses. However, some of the apparent
false—positive findings may not be simply caused by their lengths
since the methods for identifying significantly mutated genes typic—
ally account for gene length information.

TTN is one of the genes identified as the ones that are not likely
a cancer driver despite its high mutation rate but the prominent pos—
ition of TTN in both BRCA and UCEC mutual exclusivity network
strongly suggests that the mutagenesis of TTN may provide valuable
information about patient subgroups. That is, even if TTN is not a
cancer driver, the gene may be a passenger that is mutated in a spe—
cific group of patients and be a ‘witness’ of a mutagenic process
occurring in the subgroup.

To confirm the hypothesis that TTN is a witness of a particular
mutational process, we analyzed the mutational spectrum of this
gene for both cancer types (BRCA and UCEC), and compared it to
the signatures of mutational processes in human cancer (Alexandrov
et al., 2013). We found that the mutational signature of TTN in
BRCA dataset was consistent with the APOBEC signature. It
showed a significant bias towards C > T and C > G mutations—67
and 44 mutations respectively (38% and 25% of 175 mutations in
total and 50 and 33% of 132 C cite mutations). In addition, most of
these mutations are in the context where C is preceded by A or T
(71%).

In UCEC dataset, on the other hand, TTN has a different muta—
tion signature, which is consistent with P01 8 mutations. TTN
showed a strong preference for C > A and C > T mutations, having
231 and 347 mutations respectively, which represents 30 and 46%
of 761 mutations in total and 40 and 59% of C cite mutations.
Moreover, 123 of C > A mutations (53%) are TCT > TAT and 116
mutations of C > T mutations (33%) are TCG > TTG, strongly
demonstrating that TTN mutations in UCEC is associated with P01 8
mutation signature.

3.2 Mutual exclusivity patterns of 'I'I'N and TP53
indicate a group of genes predictive of patient

survival and suggest a role of APOBEC3 activity

in TP53 mutations

ME network and survival analysis: An interesting property of muta—
tional landscape of breast cancer is that frequently mutated genes
such as TP53, PIK3CA, TTN and GATA3 in breast cancer do not
have a strong discriminative power of patient survival (only TP5 3
mutations are weakly discriminative, P—value: 0.08). We therefore
asked the question whether the mutual exclusivity network could
suggest a set of genes with a better discriminative power.

Previous studies have suggested that APOBEC3B activity correl—
ates with unfavorable prognosis in breast cancer. For example, it
has been shown that APOBEC3B gene expression correlates with
the Genomic Grade Index (GGI) score and that high APOBEC3B
gene expression was associated with recurrence after treatment
(Cescon et al., 2015). According to a separate study, APOBEC3B
was associated with poor survival in ER+ breast cancer patients
(Periyasamy et al., 2015). Building on our observation that TTN
mutations are largely due to APOBEC3B activity (as discussed in the
previous section), we hypothesized that putative cancer drivers ex—
clusive with TTN mutations would be characterized by better prog—
nosis. This was indeed confirmed in our survival analysis. We found
that four genes that are exclusive with TTN (MAPK3K1, NCOA3,
AKT1, ARID1A) were a good predictor of survival jointly and also
predict disease free survival after treatment very well (Fig. 4B).
Interestingly, TTN and TP53 share the discriminative gene set as
their direct ME neighbors in the BRCA ME network (Fig. 3A). On
the other hand, adding other putative drivers exclusive with TP5 3
but not with TTN (FOX1A, MED23, MAP2K4) (CTCF was not
included because it shows a slight tendency of exclusivity with TTN,
P—value < 0.15) reduced the discriminatory power of the gene set.

WeSME: uncovering mutual exclusivity

 

Role of APOBEC3B activity in TP53 mutations: The similarity
of exclusivity patterns of TTN and TP53 is consistent with the re—
cently discovered relationship between APOBEC enzymatic activity
and TP53 mutations (Burns et al., 2013). In their research, Burns
et al. hypothesized that APOBEC3B—catalyzed deamination provides
a chronic source of DNA damage that could cause TP5 3 mutations.

To support the model proposed by Burns et al., we need to test if
it is possible that the mutations of both genes in BRCA depend on
APOBEC activity but are independent of each other after controlling
for their dependency on APOBEC. That is, under this model, we ex—
pect TTN and TP5 3 to co—occur but the significance of co—
occurrence to disappear after correcting with mutation frequencies
of patients. To test if this is the case, we developed WeSCO by
adopting the same sampling technique as WeSME for estimating the
significance of co—occurrence of mutations corrected with patient
mutation frequency. Indeed, we did not find a significant co—
occurrence (Fig. 4C, P—value : 0.29) of TTN and TP53 when apply—
ing WeSCO test while the co—occurrence was highly significant with—
out the correction ( P—value : 0.0002, hypergeometric test).

Although it is currently not known how APOBEC activity leads
to TP53 mutations, we conjecture that immune response might be
the precursor step leading, via APOBEC activity, to TP53 mutation
for some cancer patients. It has been demonstrated that the AID/
APOBEC family plays important roles in adaptive and innate im—
munity (Wang et al., 2012) and APOBEC up—regulation is correlated
with HPV—positive status, which implicates an HPV—mediated mech—
anism of APOBEC3B up—regulation for these cancer types
(Henderson et al., 2014). In particular, the authors provided evi—
dence that APOBEC activity is responsible for the generation of hel—
ical domain hot spot mutations in PIK3CA across multiple cancers.
The key role of APOBEC family in natural and adaptive immunity
strongly suggests that APOBEC up—regulation may be also related to
immune response in non—HPV mediated cases and our results sup—
port a similar mechanism for TP53 mutations in some breast cancer
cases (but not all cases as discussed below).

Underlying causes of TP53 mutations may be heterogeneous:
We observed that the subgroup of patients with TP53 mutations but
no TTN mutations had significantly lower mutation frequencies
compared to the subgroup of patients with TTN mutations (Fig. 4C;
P—value: 0.025). This suggests that the TP5 3 only group also con—
tains patients whose TP5 3 mutations are not due to APOBEC activ—
ity as otherwise we would not expect to see a difference in mutation
frequencies between the TP53 only and the TTN patient groups.
The difference of mutation frequencies in the group suggests that
underlying causes of TP53 mutations in breast cancer are
heterogeneous.

Interestingly, TP5 3 and TTN mutations are mutually exclusive
in the analysis of endometrial carcinoma data where TTN mutations
show P01 8 mutation signature (Fig. 3B). This observation suggests
that the mutations in TP53 are generally not caused by the muta—
genic process related to P01 8 mutations.

In summary, our results are consistent with the previously pro—
posed model in which APOBEC3B can be a source of mutations in
TP53 for highly mutated cancer cases, however reject the model in
which this is true across all breast cancer patients with TP5 3
mutations.

4 Conclusions

We performed a whole genome scale analysis of mutual exclusivity
of genes with mutations in breast cancer and endometrial

carcinoma. For this purpose, we first developed WeSME—a new,
fast method to estimate statistical significance of mutual exclusivity.
Similar to the permutation based method, WeSME controls muta—
tion frequencies of patients and mutation rates of genes in the null
model, but can be performed quickly with a nearly arbitrary level of
precision. The P—values estimated by WeSME closely matched the
P—values obtained with the permutation—based method. In addition,
our proposed method to control FDR takes into account the differ—
ences of P—value distributions from gene pairs with different muta—
tion rates.

The development of WeSME allowed us to perform a large—scale
mutual exclusivity analysis without restricting it to highly mutated
genes or genes known a priori to be cancer drivers. The approach
led us to uncover mutually exclusive cancer drivers, some of which
have relatively low mutation rates. In addition, our mutual exclusiv—
ity analysis allowed us to pinpoint differences between mutagenic
processes in different cancer groups. In particular, the inclusion of
TTN (a very long and frequently mutated gene) not only allowed us
to observe the patterns of APOBEC activity in breast cancer and P01
8 mutation signature in endometrial carcinoma but also help identify
a set of driver genes that is highly predictive of patient survival.
TTN was considered to be an artifact and typically filtered out in
cancer analyses.

Taken together, we developed a tool enabling a fast genome—
wide analysis of mutual exclusivity of mutations in cancer and used
it to demonstrate that the genome—wide mutual exclusivity analysis
can provide information beyond relationships between cancer
drivers.

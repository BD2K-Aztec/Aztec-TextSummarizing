Abstract

Summary: RIPPER is a framework for mass—spectrometry—based label—free relative quantification
for proteomics and metabolomics studies. RIPPER combines a series of previously described algo—
rithms for pre—processing, analyte quantification, retention time alignment, and analyte grouping
across runs. It is also the first software framework to implement proximity—based intensity normal—
ization. RIPPER produces lists of analyte signals with their unnormalized and normalized intensities
that can serve as input to statistical and directed mass spectrometry (MS) methods for detecting

 

quantitative differences between biological samples using MS.

1 Introduction

Biological studies using liquid chromatography (LC) and high-
resolution mass spectrometry (MS) have the potential to aid the in-
vestigation of molecular mechanisms by discovering biological
markers. Two important ‘omics research areas utilizing LC-MS are
metabolomics and proteomics; both face similar challenges in pro-
ducing repeatable and reproducible data (K311 and Vitek, 2011).
To address these challenges, we recently introduced proximity-
based intensity normalization (PIN) (Van Riper et (11., 2014). To
implement PIN, we created a new quantitative framework,
RIPPER, for label-free quantification (LFQ). RIPPER has since be-
come a valuable in-house tool for new MS-based quantitative
method development. Because RIPPER does not rely on analyte
identification before quantification, users can process MSl-only
data for proteomic MS-based studies and generate an inclusion list
for directed MS-based identification. By simply adjusting properties

through a graphical user interface, users can also use RIPPER to
extract analyte information for metabolomic studies, statistically
analyze the results, and conduct further fragmentation experiments
on metabolites of interest.

Here, we describe RIPPER, a Java-based framework that takes
in szML files, extracts analyte features from MSl spectral data
and reports validated analyte signal intensities. Because it allows
user-specified options and is written in Java, RIPPER accommodates
a wide array of users on various platforms (OSX, Window and
Linux). Finally, we compare RIPPER to other freely available soft-
ware, namely MaxQuant (Cox and Mann, 2008), XCMS
(Tautenhahn, et (11., 2012) and MZMine (Pluskal et (11., 2010).
MaxQuant couples LFQ to identified peptides and proteins and is
therefore not suitable to process MSl-only data. Furthermore,
MaxQuant cannot process metabolomic data. XCMS is an online
service for metabolomic data and is not well suited for proteomic
data. MZMine can process both proteomic and metabolomic data

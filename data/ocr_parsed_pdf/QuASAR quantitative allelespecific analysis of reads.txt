Abstract

Motivation: Expression quantitative trait loci (eOTL) studies have discovered thousands of genetic
variants that regulate gene expression, enabling a better understanding of the functional role of
non—coding sequences. However, eOTL studies are costly, requiring large sample sizes and
genome—wide genotyping of each sample. In contrast, analysis of allele—specific expression (ASE)
is becoming a popular approach to detect the effect of genetic variation on gene expression, even
within a single individual. This is typically achieved by counting the number of RNA—seq reads
matching each allele at heterozygous sites and testing the null hypothesis of a 1:1 allelic ratio. In
principle, when genotype information is not readily available, it could be inferred from the RNA—
seq reads directly. However, there are currently no existing methods that jointly infer genotypes
and conduct ASE inference, while considering uncertainty in the genotype calls.

Results: We present OuASAR, quantitative allele—specific analysis of reads, a novel statistical
learning method for jointly detecting heterozygous genotypes and inferring ASE. The proposed
ASE inference step takes into consideration the uncertainty in the genotype calls, while including
parameters that model base—call errors in sequencing and allelic over—dispersion. We validated our
method with experimental data for which high—quality genotypes are available. Results for an add—
itional dataset with multiple replicates at different sequencing depths demonstrate that OuASAR is
a powerful tool for ASE analysis when genotypes are not available.

understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying GWAS hits
requires functional characterization of each variant in the tissue and
environmental conditions relevant for the trait under study (e.g. es—
trogen level for genetic risk to breast cancer, Cowper—Sal-lari et al.,
2012).

The ongoing GTEx project will significantly increase the number
of surveyed tissues for which eQTL data are available and will repre—
sent a useful resource to functionally annotate genetic variants.
However, the number of cell types and environments explored are a
small subset of the presumably larger number of regulatory variants
that mediate specific GxE interactions. eQTL studies are expensive,
requiring large sample sizes (11 > 70), which may be difficult to achieve
for tissues that are obtained by surgical procedures or are difficult to
culture in Uitro. Even if biospecimens are readily available at no cost,
eQTL studies require large amounts of experimental work to measure
genotypes and gene expression levels. As the measurement of gene ex—
pression using high—throughput sequencing (RNA—seq) is becoming
more popular than microarrays, RNA—seq library preparation is also
becoming less expensive ($46/sample), whereas costs of sequencing
are also very rapidly decreasing (e.g. 16M reads per sample would
cost $49 using a multiplexing strategy). Additionally, the sequence in—
formation provided by RNA—seq can be used to call genotypes
(Duitama et al., 2012; Piskol et al., 2013; Shah et al., 2009), detect
and quantify isoforms (Katz et al., 2010; Trapnell et al., 2010) and to
measure allele—specific expression (ASE), if enough sequencing depth
is available (Degner et al., 2009; Pastinen, 2010).

ASE approaches currently represent the most effective way to
assay the effect of a cis—regulatory variant within a defined cellular
environment, while controlling for any trans—acting modifiers of
gene expression, such as the genotype at other loci (Cowper—Sal-lari
et al., 2012; Hasin—Brumshtein et al., 2014; Kasowski et al., 2010;
Kukurba et al., 2014; McDaniell et al., 2010; McVicker et al., 2013;
Pastinen, 2010; Reddy et al., 2012; Skelly et al., 2011). As such,
ASE studies have greater statistical power to detect genetic effects in
cis than a traditional eQTL mapping approach when using a small
sample size. Additionally, ASE may also be useful to detect epigen—
etic imprinting of gene expression if ASE is present but no eQTL is
detected (Degner et al., 2009; Seoighe et al., 2006).

In the absence of ASE, the two alleles for a heterozygous geno—
type at a single—nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in a gene transcript
are represented in a 1:1 ratio of RNA—seq reads. To reject the null
hypothesis and infer ASE, it is necessary to first identify heterozy—
gous SNPs with high confidence and then conduct inference to de—
tect a departure from a 50% allelic ratio. Although genotyping and
ASE are usually considered two separate problems, miscalling a
homozygous SNP as heterozygous is likely to induce an error in re—
jecting the ASE null hypothesis; thus, we argue that the two prob—
lems should addressed together.

Although it is possible to obtain genotype information from
RNA—seq (Duitama et al., 2012; Piskol et al., 2013; Shah et al.,
2009), to the best of our knowledge, all existing methods for detect—
ing ASE consider the genotypes known and error probabilities asso—
ciated with genotyping are not taken into account for the ASE step.
Although overall genotyping quality can also be modeled within the
ASE model (McVicker et al., 2013), there is currently no method
that for each SNP can jointly genotype and detect allelic imbalances
in high—throughput sequencing data. An approach that takes into ac—
count base—calling errors was previously proposed for detecting ASE
in ESTs data (Seoighe et al., 2006), but for RNA—seq data, it is essen—
tial to also include overdispersion. Here, we propose a novel frame—
work for quantitative allele—specific analysis of reads (QuASAR)
that starts from a single or multiple RNA—seq experiments from the

same individual and can directly identify heterozygous SNPs and as—
sess ASE accurately by taking into account base—calling errors and
overdispersion in the ASE ratio. QuASAR is evaluated with two dif—
ferent datasets that demonstrate genotyping accuracy and the im—
portance of incorporating the genotype uncertainty when
performing ASE inference.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 QuASAR approach

QuASAR starts with experimental high—throughput sequencing
data. Here, we focus on RNA—seq, but the same or similar pipeline
can be applied to DNase—seq, ChIP—seq, ATAC—seq or other types of
functional genomics library preparations. Figure 1 illustrates the
underlying problem: detecting SNPs covered by a number of tran—
scripts with high allelic imbalance and for which homozygosity (in
the presence of base—calling errors) can also be rejected.

We focus our attention on sites that are known to be variable in
human populations, specifically we consider all SNPs from the 1000
Genomes project (1KG) with a minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.02.
We index each SNP with l E {1,. . ., L} and each sample by
s E {1,. . .,S}. All samples are from the same individual and may rep—
resent different experimental conditions or replicates. We only con—
sider SNPs represented in at least 15 reads across all the samples. At
each site 1, three genotypes are possible g, E {0, 1, 2} being homozy—
gous reference (RR), heterozygous (RA) or homozygous alternate
(AA), respectively. For each sample 5 and site 1, NS.) represents the
total number of reads and rs, : {rslkﬁjil take the value 1 if read k
matches the reference allele and 0 if it matches the alternate allele.
We can then model the data D : {{rsl}f:1},:1 as a mixture model

where we will only observe reads matching the alternate allele if
those are base—calling errors, here modeled by the parameter 6,.
Conversely, for G1: 2, we have the following:

If the genotype is heterozygous G1: 1, we observe reads from
the reference allele with probability p, or the alternate allele with

ConSIdering that RS, : :12; 751k and A51: N51 — R51 are, respect—

the reference allele and the alternate allele, the previous equations

The prior genotype probabilities Pr(G, : g) are obtained from
the 1KG allele frequencies assuming Hardy—Weinberg equilibrium,
but the user can change this.

After we run QuASAR to infer genotypes across samples from
the same individual, for each site we have a posterior probability of
each genotype (0;), and a base—calling error E, estimated for each
sample. From these posteriors, discrete genotypes are called by using
the genotype with the highest posterior probability; the maximum a
posteriori (MAP) estimate.

2.2.3 ASE inference

To detect ASE, we only consider sites with an heterozygous MAP
higher than a given threshold (e.g.  > 0.99). We then test the
possibility that p51 deviates from 0.5 while also taking into
account overdispersion using a beta—binomial model [combining (7)

and (8)]:

ard gradient method (L—BFGS—B) to maximize the log—likelihood
function

Finally, all parameters are used to calculate the LRT statistic in
(9) and its P value.

Additionally, we can provide an estimate of the standard error
associated with the parameter p5, using the second derivative of the
log—likelihood function (15):

Alternatively, we can also recover a standard error from (9) (as
is asymptotically distributed as Kiel), by using the P value to back
solve for the standard error:

 

A ( in: (17)

p" Q(%)
where  is the quantile function for a standard normal distribu—

tion and p15 is the P value from (9). We use the first form (16)
when ,6 ~05 and (17) otherwise, as each provides a better

 

approximation at those ranges. Alternatively, if we do not need am,

we can use (15) to obtain a profile likelihood confidence interval
for p51.

2.3 Experimental data

LCLs (GM18507 and GM18508) were purchased from Coriell Cell
Repository and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)
from Lonza. LCLs were cultured and starved according to
Maranville et al. (2011). Cryopreserved HUVECs were thawed and
cultured according to the manufacturer protocol (Lonza), with the
exception that 48 h prior to collection, the medium was changed to
a starvation medium, composed of phenol—red free EGM—2, without
hydrocortisone and supplemented with 2% charcoal stripped—FBS.
Cells were washed 2X using ice cold phosphate—buffered saline,
lysed on the plate, using Lysis/Binding Buffer (Ambion) and frozen
at —80°C. mRNA was isolated using the Ambion Dynabeads
mRNA Direct kit (Life Technologies). We then prepared libraries
for Illumina sequencing using a modified version of the NEBNext
Ultra Directional RNA—seq Library preparation kit (New England
Biolabs). Briefly, each mRNA sample was fragmented (300 nt) and
converted to double—stranded cDNA, onto which we ligated bar—
coded DNA adapters (NEXTflex—96 RNA—seq Barcodes, BIOO
Scientific). Double—sided SPRI size selection (SPRISelect Beads,
Beckman Coulter) was performed to select 35 0—500 bp fragments.
The libraries were then amplified by polymerase chain reaction and
pooled for sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 at the University
of Chicago Genomics Core. For each LCL sample, libraries from
nine replicates were pooled for a total of 42.3M and 34.9M 50—bp
PE reads, respectively. We subsequently resequenced this libraries
for a total of 81.0M and 78.6M 150—bp PE reads. For the HUVEC
samples (267M reads total), we collected data for 18 replicates
across six time points to capture a wide range of basal physiologic
conditions.

2.4 Pre—processing

To create a core set of SNPs for ASE analysis, we first removed rare
(MAF< 5%) variants from all 1KG SNPs (see Supplementary
Material for an analysis without this step). We also removed SNPs
within 25 bases upstream or downstream of another SNP or short
InDels as well as SNPs in regions of annotated copy numbers or
other blacklisted regions (Degner et al., 2012). Reads were aligned
to the reference human genome hg19 using bwa mem (Li and
Durbin, 2009, http://bio—bwa.sourceforge.net). Reads with quality
<10 and duplicate reads were removed using samtools rmdup
(http://github.com/samtools/). Using a mappability filter (Degner et
al., 2012), we removed reads that do not map uniquely to the refer—
ence genome and to alternate genome sequences built considering all
1KG variants. Aligned reads were then piled up on the core set of
SNPs using samtools mpileup command. Reads with an SNP at
the beginning or at the end of the read, or with indels were also
removed to avoid any potential experimental bias. Finally, the pile—
ups were re—formatted, so that each SNP has a count for reads con—
taining the reference allele and a count for those containing the
alternate allele.

2.5 Comparison with other methods

To assess QuASAR genotyping quality, we focused on the LCL data
and compared genotype calls to those of 1KG project. We also com—
pared QuASAR genotyping accuracy to samtools + bcftools
(Li and Durbin, 2009) and GATK (DePristo et al., 2011). To assess
QuASAR ASE inference, we used QQ plots and eQTL derived from
the GEUVADIS dataset (Lappalainen et al., 2013; Wen et al., 2014).

samples (data types, conditions, cell types or technical replicates),
the more certainty we can gather about the genotype.

A key aspect of the QuASAR ASE inference step is that it takes
into account over—dispersion and genotype uncertainty resulting in a
test that we have shown to be well calibrated. In many cases, the P
values obtained from biased statistics can be recalibrated to the true
null distribution using a permutation procedure. Unfortunately, this
is not possible for ASE inference, as randomly permuting the reads
assigned to each allele would inadvertently assume that the reads are
distributed according to a binomial distribution. More complicated
and computationally costly resampling procedures can be proposed,
but it is not clear what additional assumptions may be introduced
and if such methods can correctly take into account genotyping
uncertainty.

If prior genotype information is available, it can also be provided
as input to the algorithm. The prior uncertainty of the genotypes
should be reflected in the form of prior probabilities for each geno—
type. In this article, we have shown that we can obtain reliable geno—
type information from RNA—seq reads, thus making additional
genotyping unnecessary if the endpoint is to detect ASE.
Instead, sequencing the RNA—seq libraries at a higher depth is
probably a better strategy as it greatly improves the power to detect
ASE.

Furthermore, as sequencing costs decrease rapidly, ASE methods
are becoming very attractive in applications where eQTL studies
have been previously used. This is of increased importance in
scenarios where collecting a large number of samples is expensive or
infeasible. Large—scale eQTL studies are still very much necessary
for fine mapping, but analysis of ASE can provide unique
insights into mechanisms that are uncovered only under specific
experimental conditions, e.g. as a result of gene x environment
interactions.

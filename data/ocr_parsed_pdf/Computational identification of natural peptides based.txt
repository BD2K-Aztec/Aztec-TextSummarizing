ABSTRACT

Motivation: Many secretory peptides are synthesized as inactive pre-
cursors that must undergo post-translational processing to become
biologically active peptides. Attempts to predict natural peptides are
limited by the low performance of proteolytic site predictors and by the
high combinatorial complexity of pairing such sites. To overcome
these limitations, we analyzed the site-wise evolutionary mutation
rates of peptide hormone precursors, calculated using the Rate4Site
algorithm.

Results: Our analysis revealed that within their precursors, peptide
residues are significantly more conserved than the pro-peptide resi-
dues. This disparity enables the prediction of peptides with a precision
of ~60% at a recall of 40% [receiver-operating characteristic curve
(ROC) AUC 0.79]. Subsequently, combining the Rate4Site score with
additional features and training a Random Forest classifier enable the
prediction of natural peptides hidden within secreted human proteins
at a precision of ~90% at a recall of 50% (R00 AUC 0.96). The high
performance of our method allows it to be applied to full secretomes
and to predict naturally occurring active peptides. Our prediction on
Homo sapiens revealed several putative peptides in the human secre-
tome that are currently unannotated. Furthermore, the unique expres-
sion of some of these peptides implies a potential hormone function,
including peptides that are highly expressed in endocrine glands.

1 INTRODUCTION

Many secretory proteins and peptides are initially synthesized as
larger precursors, usually in the form of pre-pro-proteins. (Note
that the term peptide is sometimes used also to describe a protein
fragment. This study, however, focuses on endogenous peptides
that are synthesized by translation of messenger RNA (mRNA)
followed by proteolysis to generate the mature form.) Such
precursor proteins undergo post-translational proteolysis: the
N—terminal pre-region, known as signal peptide, is cleaved by a

well-characterized signal peptidase (Dalbey and Von Heijne,
1992; Paetzel et al., 2002), whereas various proteases liberate
the active peptides from the pro-proteins (Seidah and Chretien,
1999). They are often subjected to proteolysis to generate the
mature form.

Examples of peptide hormones, whose proteolytic processing
regulates their activities, include insulin, somatostatin, parathy-
roid hormone, glucagon and GLP-1. Many of these are used as
therapeutic peptides for treating various disorders.

The importance of identifying mature peptides fuels both ex-
perimental and computational approaches aimed at discovering
and predicting proteolytic sites. Traditionally, the main method
for discovering short peptides, such as hormones or GPCR lig-
ands, was performed through biochemical separation coupled
with functional assays. This approach is challenging, as peptides
often have restricted expression, exist at low abundance in com-
plex biological matrices together with other secreted and shedded
proteins and have highly diverse physiological functions. In
recent years, there have been several attempts based on biochem-
ical separation and puriﬁcation coupled with various mass spec-
trometry techniques (Kalkum et al., 2003; Ohyama et al., 2008).

Today, prediction of natural peptides is possible because of
advancements in computational biology algorithms enabling the
analysis of the fast-growing genome and proteome databases.
Nevertheless, many computational approaches are limited to
the classical furin and dibasic proteolytic sites, which can be
identiﬁed through the use of simple regular expressions (Shi
et al., 2012; Shichiri et al., 2003), whereas predictors aiming to
treat more complex pro-hormone convertase cleavage sites have
relatively low performance (Duckert et al., 2004; Hummon et al.,
2003; Kliger et al., 2008), which leads to many falsely predicted
peptides. Approaches where putative peptides are computation-
ally identiﬁed directly, based on a hidden Markov model or ma-
chine learning, are limited to cases where sequence similarity to
known peptides is signiﬁcant (Mirabeau et al., 2007; Shemesh
et al., 2008; Sonmez et al., 2009). We speculate that sequence and
structural divergence impairs the computational identiﬁcation of
many peptides using this approach. Thus, we looked for methods
that can circumvent these obstacles.

In this study, we test the hypothesis that the amino acid se-
quence of functional peptides is more conserved (among ortho-
logous proteins) in comparison with the rest of the precursor
sequence. This is true in several well-known examples, like corti-
coliberin, tachykinin-3 and insulin (Fig. 1). Using a secretome-
wide analysis, we demonstrate that the relative conservation of
peptide sequences is high enough to allow prediction of peptides

which combines additional features, achieves even higher per-
formance and highlights several predicted peptides as potential
novel hormones.

2 METHOD

2.1 Precursor screening and analysis

Human protein sequences were downloaded from the Uniprot knowledge
base (Release 2013_05, May 1, 2013). Signal peptides were predicted using
SignalP version 3.0 (Bendtsen et al., 2004; Nielsen et al., 1997), and the
presence and positions of transmembrane domains were predicted using
TMHMM version 2.0 (Krogh et al., 2001; Sonnhammer et al., 1998). The
‘human secretome’ was constructed as the list of human proteins possessing
a signal peptide and no transmembrane domain.

2.2 Data preparation

For each secreted protein (from UniProt), orthologs were collected using
reciprocal Blast queries. A version of the NCBI non-redundant protein

sequence database (from March 18, 2012) cleaned from synthetic con-
structs and partial sequences was compiled. Reciprocal Blast was used to
eliminate the false identiﬁcation as orthologs of non-orthologous proteins
that share relatively high sequence similarity and was implemented in two
rounds of Blast: the ﬁrst round collects the top hits to the query protein
with scores 390% of the highest score (for each organism, separately).
The second round selects one ortholog in each organism only if its best hit
in Homo sapiens is the original query protein. Multiple sequence align-
ment (MSA) of the orthologs was performed using MAFFT version
6.240 (Katoh and Standley, 2013; Katoh et al., 2002), and relative
amino acid substitution evolutionary rate of each position was calculated
using Rate4Site version 3.0.0 (Mayrose et al., 2004; Pupko et al., 2002) or
entropy. Rate4Site assigns a variability score for each position in the
MSA using an empirical Bayesian inference, which considers the topology
and branch lengths of the phylogenetic tree generated based only on the
amino acids in this position, as well as the underlying stochastic process.

2.3 Peptide prediction

The positions of proteolytic sites in secreted human proteins were pre-
dicted using the Random Forest (RF) classiﬁers described in our previous
work (Kliger et al., 2008). Sites that are not conserved in at least ﬁve
orthologs were excluded. Presumed peptides were taken as segments of
3770 residues located either between predicted two cleavage sites or be-
tween a predicted cleavage site and one of the pro-protein termini. For
each precursor and potential peptide, the mean and standard deviation of
the Rate4Site score were calculated and used as features for a peptide
predictor. Additional features include the precursor and peptide lengths,
the number of cysteine residues and its parity and two ﬂags indicating
whether the peptide starts at the signal peptide cleavage site or ends at
the protein C-terminus. The peptide predictor was based on the
RandomForest algorithm (Breiman, 2001) implemented in R (Team,
2005). The predictor was trained on a positive set of known peptides
extracted from SwissProt. Segments of the same length distribution
from other secreted proteins, which are not known to be proteolytically
processed, were used as a negative set.

2.4 Tissue speciﬁcity
mRNA expression across different tissues was analyzed using MED (Erez

et al., 2004; Helpman et al., 2009). Protein expression was based on
ProteinAtlas (www.proteinatlas.org).

3 RESULTS

We tested the hypothesis that there are more constraints on the
primary structure (i.e. sequence) of functional peptides relative to
that of non-functional segments from the same precursor. To
start, we analyzed the relative sequence variability per position
of a few well-known examples using Rate4Site (Fig. 1). This
analysis reveals that the functional peptide corticoliberin,
which is proteolytically cleaved from the precursor CRH, is
more conserved than the pro-peptide (Fig. 1, top panel).
Similarly, the functional peptide neurokinin—B is more conserved
in comparison with the rest of the TAC—3 precursor (Fig. 1,
middle panel). In a more complex example, the functional seg-
ments of insulin (chains A and B) are signiﬁcantly more con-
served than the pro-peptide (chain C) that resides between them
(Fig. 1, bottom panel). One important point to note is that irre-
spective of the peptide’s location within the precursor, we can see
that this conservation is still observed. For example, corticoli-
berin is at the most C-terminal part of its precursor, neurokinin-
B resides between non-functional pro-peptides and insulin is

composed of two peptides; nevertheless, the same phenomenon is
observed in all these examples.

To test whether this phenomenon is strong enough to distin-
guish between functional peptides and other segments that reside
between two predicted proteolytic sites, we followed the scheme
presented in Figure 2. Analysis of the average Rate4Site scores of
known peptides (R4S_in) reveals that a fraction of them are
significantly more conserved (have low Rate4Site scores) when
compared with the negative set (Fig. 3, left panel). Although this
result indicates that it is possible to computationally discover
functional peptides, the counts histogram of the same two
datasets (Fig. 3, right panel) points that this is not a trivial
task because the peptides are masked by many non-peptidic seg-
ments that reside between two predicted proteolytic sites and are
conserved owing to other evolutionary constraints, like func-
tional sites. Nevertheless, sorting potential peptides solely by
their R4S_in scores achieves a reasonable predictive performance
(Fig. 4, top panels, solid line), with a precision of ~60% at a
recall of 40% [receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC)
AUC 0.79]. This naive Rate4Site-based score performs better
than an entropy-based score (Fig. 4, top panels, dotted line; a
precision of ~45% at a recall of 40%). This fortiﬁes our decision
to favor Rate4site over a simpler entropy calculation. Rate4Site
acts as a better predictor of local conservation compared with
entropy because of the fact that its estimations of residue muta-
tion rates take into account the global divergence between dif-
ferent orthologs.

Performance was signiﬁcantly improved (Fig. 4, bottom
panels) when an RF classiﬁer was trained with R4S_in and add-
itional features, achieving a precision of ~90% at a recall of 50%
(ROC AUC 0.96). The added features included the standard
deviation of R4S_in, the precursor and predicted peptide lengths,
the number of cysteine residues and its parity in the predicted
peptide, whether the predicted peptide starts immediately after
the signal peptide and whether the predicted peptide ends at the
end of the protein precursor.

The classiﬁer was trained with a positive set consisting of
known functional peptides that also exist in the list of putative
list of peptides and a sample of the negative set that included
only one randomly selected potential peptide from each precur-
sor (Fig. 2; pseudocode is provided in the Supplementary
Material). Because the classiﬁer performance is high enough to

The performance evaluation presented in Figure 4 reﬂects the
predictor’s performance on the dataset used, and therefore, it is
inaccurate because of the following reasons: (i) unknown pep-
tides are labeled ‘negative’, and therefore, there is an underesti-
mation of the real precision; (ii) approximately one-third of the
peptides annotated in SwissProt are not labeled ‘positive’ because
they involve proteolytic sites that are not predicted by the cleav-
age site predictor (e. g., non-R/K sites), and this causes overesti-
mation of the recall; (iii) to remove bias from the learning set, we
retained in the negative set only one case from each precursor
and none from precursors with a known peptide, leading to an
overestimation of the precision.

Dozens of predicted peptides were highly scored by the clas-
sifier (Fig. 5). Manual curation of the top scores resulted in
Supplementary Table S1, which also describes the mRNA and
protein expression of the precursors. The high expression in
endocrine glands of some of the predicted peptides supports
their authenticity.

4 DISCUSSION

To the best of our knowledge, usage of evolutionary profile to
predict functional native peptides has not been studied before,
although it has been implemented in the past to uncover func-
tional residues (Lopez et al., 2007, 2011) and functional patches
on protein surfaces (Ashkenazy et al., 2010; Nimrod et al., 2005).
We can speculate that others have not chosen this approach for
peptide identification because of the concern that functional
native peptides could not be distinguished from functional seg-
ments or domains within proteins (which reside between falsely
predicted proteolytic sites) on the basis of their relative sequence
conservation. Our study found that in many cases peptides can
be separated from functional segments. A reasonable explan-
ation for this success is that although there are few constraints
on sequences that are removed during peptide maturation (pro-
peptides), there are many more constraints applied to sequences
adjacent to functional segments and domains, as these segments
are part of a mature protein.

Sequence-based methods for peptide identiﬁcation, whether
based on HMM or other techniques, can only ﬁnd novel peptides
with some sequence similarity to known ones. One of the advan-
tages of the approach described in this study is that its learning
phase is sequence-independent and therefore can identify pep-
tides that have no sequence similarity to any known peptide.
For example, we predicted the existence of a few peptides in
the CF057_HUMAN and F150B_HUMAN precursors
(Fig. 6). In both cases, there is no sequence similarity to any

known peptide. In CF057_HUMAN, we predict that there is a
proteolytic site between residues 104 and 105 (RKGR104|C) fol-
lowed by the removal of R104 by carboxypeptidase E (Day et al.,
1998; Friis-Hansen et al., 2001) and amidation of K102. Note
that C-terminal amidation is a well-known post-translational
modiﬁcation that increases the stability of many native peptides
(Bradbury et al., 1982). There are two options for the N-terminus
of this potential peptide%}90 and Y9kwhich cannot be easily
distinguished by this approach. According to ProteinAtlas, the
precursor of this potential peptide is highly expressed in the
testis’ Leydig cells, the placenta’s trophoblastic cells, melano-
cytes, some neuronal cells and glandular cells of various tissues
including gall bladder, digestive tract, uterus, fallopian tube,
parathyroid gland and adrenal gland. For F150B_HUMAN,
we predict a peptide at the C-terminus (Fig. 6, bottom panel).
It is an interesting peptide because it possesses two cysteines that
might form a stabilizing intra-peptide disulphide bridge. The ex-
pression of this precursor in the adrenal gland, duodenum and
small intestine glandular cells supports the functionality of this
peptide as genuine. It is noteworthy that a similar predicted pep-
tide appears in the paralogous F150A_HUMAN precursor.
Another potential beneﬁt of the peptide classiﬁer described
here is to determine whether currently annotated peptides
possess a function, i.e. detecting false-positive findings in the
scientiﬁc literature and databases. Notably, calcitonin
(CALC_HUMAN, residues 8&116) is conserved relative to the
upstream pro-peptide, whereas katacalcin (CALC_HUMAN,
residues 1217141) is variable. Thus, we posit that katacalcin is
not a functional peptide (Fig. 7, top). Similarly, we suggest that
the highly variable ‘potential peptide’ (residues 10&134) and

Our analysis highlights the conservation of the known peptide (residues
8&116) but reveals high variability for katacalcin (1217141). Therefore,
we predict that katacalcin is not a functional peptide. Bottom panel:
evolutionary proﬁles of pro-opiomelanocortin (COLI_HUMAN). Our
analysis highlights the conservation of some of the annotated peptides.
In addition, our analysis reveals high variability for the ‘potential peptide’
(1057134) and for lipotropin y (17%234). We predict that these highly
variable segments are not functional peptides. For simplicity, some of the
potential peptides were omitted from the ﬁgure. See Figure 1 for details

lipotropin y (residues 1797234) of pro-opiomelanocortin
(COLI_HUMAN) are not functional peptides (Fig. 7, bottom).

In this study, we preferred Rate4Site over entropy because the
former takes into account the topology and branch lengths of the
phylogenetic tree. Thus, Rate4Site accounts for sequence redun-
dancy without discarding part of the data and is therefore ex-
pected to be more accurate than entropy. Figure 4 demonstrates
that Rate4Site has a stronger predictive power than entropy: at a
recall of 40%, Rate4Site gives a precision of ~60% compared
with that of ~45% given by entropy.

In conclusion, this study highlights how evolutionary analysis
can be instrumental in functional annotation.

Automated randomization of multiple traits

 

2.3 Using ARTS

Users have several options for downloading and using ARTS, including
command-line and graphical user interfaces. More details are given in
Supplementary Section S5. Additionally, Supplementary Section S6 pre-
sents two case studies describing randomization of clinical sample sets by
ARTS.

Funding: National Institutes of Health (grants ULlTROOOOSO, in part)
(University of Illinois CTSA); University of Illinois Cancer Center.

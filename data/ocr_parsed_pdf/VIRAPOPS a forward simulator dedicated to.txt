ABSTRACT

Summary: Daily, mutability and recombination of RNA viruses result in
the production of million variants. All these rapid genomic changes
directly influence the functional sites of the protein, its 3D structure
or its drug resistances. Therefore, it is important to simulate these
drastic switches to determine their effects on virus populations.
Many computer programs are able to simulate specific variations in
DNA genomes, but are generally non-adapted to RNA viruses. They
simulate site-specific selection pressures, but rarely pressures on
covariant or on higher order correlated sites and no at all on synthetic
lethal groups. That is why we felt it important to create VIRAPOPS, a
forward simulator that models specific RNA virus functions. It was
designed for computational biologists, biologists and virologists.

1 INTRODUCTION

RNA Viruses have different characteristics from other popula-
tions. Their high mutability rate, 100 times higher than those of
bacteria or eukaryotes, allows the production of daily million
mutations. These multiple mutants, under selective pressure,
permit the emergence of new Viral variants. Several population
simulators called ‘forward’ are able to impose a selective pressure
on mutations: CDPOP (Landguth and Cushman, 2010),
Nemo2.2 (Guillaume and Rougemont, 2006), SimuPop (Peng
and Kimmel, 2005), SFS_C0de (Hernandez, 2008) and Vortex
(Lacy et al., 2009). These software solutions associate ﬁtness to
an allele and can combine several allele ﬁtnesses. Unfortunately,
this is done by adding or multiplying individual ﬁtness that does
not fit all situations. The covariation of two sites can deﬁne
compensatory mutations (CM: the first mutation decreases the
ﬁtness of the organism and the second compensates the ﬁtness
lack of the first) or synthetic lethal (SL: mutations that are non-
lethal when they are alone but become lethal when they are
combined into a single genome). If pair of CMs are treated by
existing simulator (Mostowy et al., 2011), SLs are not. In the SL
case, both mutations taken separately does not change the ﬁtness
of the Virus, it is only when they appear together that the ﬁtness

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

is changed. Then we cannot add or multiply ﬁtness associated
with each mutation or used the calculation done for CM.
However, the synthetic lethals are used for therapy developments
(Brouillet et al., 2010; Dahirel et al., 2011) and Viral vaccines.
Therefore, it becomes crucial to be able to simulate them.
In addition, the higher order correlated mutations (involving
covariation of CM or SL type, but with a number >2 sites) are
not covered by conventional simulators.

Software programs dedicated to Viral studies are able to pre-
dict drug resistances as HIde (human immunodeﬁciency Virus
database) program from Stanford university (Liu and Shafer,
2006), to store clinical data related to human immunodeﬁciency
Virus (HIV) and hepatitis C Virus treatment and subtyping tools
as REGA (Pineda-Pena et al., 2013) to calculate their pharma-
cokinetics and pharmacodynamics as Simcyp (Jamei et al., 2009),
or to make epidemic model as FluTE (Chao et al., 2010), but do
not allow large group of mutations simulation as described ear-
lier in the text.

On one hand, Vortex, SimuPop, SFS_C0de and CDPOP soft-
wares dedicated to population genetics do not take into account
the essential tools to treat high mutability of RNA Viruses. On
the other hand, software more directly dedicated to Virus handle
databases related to drugs, geographic spread or drug resistances
(SimCYP, REGA, HIde). But none of these two types of
family simulator is able to handle Viral populations at high
rates mutability. Yet it is now essential to use such tools to
meet the ever greater emergence of new mutations including
those related to drug resistances.

However, under selection pressure, new genomes appear
quickly and increase the difﬁculty of treatment developments
and stable vaccine design. In addition, due to high genome plas-
ticity, the protein 3D structure becomes plural, making difﬁcult
docking work, and study of the active sites. Thus, it is necessary
to simulate an RNA Virus sequence population. We present in
this manuscript an understandable, useful and easy-to-use RNA
Virus population simulator, designed to model a real situation
such as Virus population in a naive or infected patient (Fig. 1).

2 OVERVIEW OF VIRAPOPS
2.1 Input

The input sequences must be in nucleotide Fasta format or text
format (one sequence/line). The output format will be the same
as the selected input format.

2.1.] Speciﬁc options related to RNA virus Large genomic
changes induced by high mutation rate require to strengthen
this pole. VIRAPOPS implements selective pressures at one or
multiple sites, can force mutation in a particular amino acid and
can generate CMs or SL pairs or groups. A complex multivariant
network composed of CMs and SLs groups can also be
generated.

2.1.2 Speciﬁc options related to the infection type The data may
concern a seronegative patient infected by a single Virus or more.
In the case of surinfection of an already RNA Virus-positive pa-
tient, an option of gene ﬂow may be used. To deal with a cascade
of infection cycle, a genetic drift option has been created. By
selected generations on which genetic drifts and/0r gene flows
occurred, multiple cycles of infection and surinfection can be
simulated on the same run. Outputs per generation are detailed
tools for studying each infection step described previously.

2.1.3 Other options Extra options have been added to help
biologists. It is possible to stop the simulator if an average per-
centage of mutations is reached. It is also possible to attain a
maximum number of sequences and impose this number for
future generations. Thus, the Hardineinberg model can be fol-
lowed if necessary. Hotspot option was created to deal with the
fact that certain positions on certain genes are known to mutate
more frequently than others (this is not due to selection pressure
but because polymerase incorporates a wrong nucleotide at this
place more easily than elsewhere). Finally, a redundancy option
was created more speciﬁcally for computer biologists because for
special purposes, they prefer to work on a unique sequence set
(option available on DNA or protein sequences).

2.2 Ouput

Each generation produces a sequence set. The outputs are used
to determine the impact of an infectious event occurring

speciﬁcally in either generation. Its format shall be the same as
the input. Regarding the HIV sequence, a Fasta output format
will allow to determine the drug resistance status of each output
sequences using the Sierra site at Stanford University (Liu and
Shafer, 2006).

2.3 Example of use

2.3.] HIV multitherapy and resistant mutation apparition Anti-
HIV treatments are composed of several molecules against which
resistance mutations can be selected. It could generate a conﬂict
between a group of mutations needed to counteract drug A and
another group of mutations needed to counteract the drug B. By
simulating the appearance of mutations needed for both resist-
ances, two scenarios can appear:

- The population will increase because of resistance muta-
tion accumulation, showing no drug interaction issues.
This result could reveal a potential future inactive treat-
ment. The number of generations needed to get an inactive
treatment may also be calculated using VIRAPOPS.

- The population remains undeveloped. Then, this therapy
may be used because the resistance mutations against
drugs A and B could not occur together.

To simulate this scenario, we propose to use a single sequence
representing a Virus that infects a seronegative patient. The mu-
tation rate of the polymerase will be adjusted to 10—4. The fol-
lowing variables must be entered in option 10: variability at each
position, the covariability per positions couple both inferred
from sequence alignment of untreated patients. Option 12 was
created to enter selection pressures due to treatments (e.g.
Nelﬁnavir D30N, 184A/V, N88S/D and L90M). The simulator
will be launched on 50 generations, for example (option 3) with,
if desired 60 budding virions/cycle (option 4). If the resistance
mutations are Viable, i.e. compatible with the variance and co-
variance that were previously entered, the sequence number will
increase over time. Otherwise, the number of sequences will be
stable or reduced.

2.3.2 Treatment interruption and consequences Some patients
stop their treatment without informing their doctor (usually
this latter noticing it when the patient’s Viral load increases
again). These treatment stops can be simulated to evaluate
what treatment would be most appropriate after such situation.
This scenario will be coded in two stages. The ﬁrst will be equiva-
lent to that described in the previous paragraph. It will be the
ﬁrst part of the scenario in which the patient takes treatment.
The batch of sequences generated will serve as input to simulate
the cessation of treatment. In the second part, the same options
are used with the exception of those corresponding to the treat-
ment (Option 12). The new generated batch of sequences corres-
ponds to the Viral sequences of patient who has interrupted his/
her treatment. It is important to note that the time of treatment
interruption may be decreased or increased by changing the
number of Viral generations (option 3).

2.3.3 Using SL Oncology and Virology are two areas where
drugs that bind SLs are developed. Before the production
stage, it would be advisable to see the possible interaction

between these SL groups and necessary positions for the proper
functioning of drugs already developed (especially in the case of
HIV where multitherapies are generally necessary). So the
docked drug on SL groups could avoid a resistance to another
existing drug that would greatly strengthen the effect of this mul-
tiple therapy. To compute this simulation, two scenarios should
be compared. The ﬁrst one, similar to that of Section 2.3.1,
simulates a patient with treatment. The second scenario retains
the same options except those corresponding to the treatment
selection pressure (this scenario is similar to the interruption pro-
cessing part 2.3.2). Both simulations generate sets of sequences
for which the SL couples will be determined (Brouillet et al.,
2010). The SL couples belonging to the ‘treated patient’ scenario
and not to the ‘untreated patients’ scenario should be used as a
therapeutic target for the development of new treatments.

2.3.4 Change treatment We would like to determine whether a
patient treatment generates a resistance to a second treatment,
which be administered to the same patient in addition to or in-
stead of the first treatment. It would be inappropriate to change
therapy to a new less effective one. So after programming the
simulator as explained earlier in the text with the data for the
current treatment, it is sufﬁcient to determine whether the first
treatment revealed mutations responsible for resistance to a
future second treatment.

3 CONCLUSION

We developed VIRAPOPS, the first software dedicated to RNA
Virus population simulation. It allows Virus variability represen-
tation, as variation site, covariation pair or higher order correl-
ation in CM and SL. Moreover, it allows simulation of primary,
secondary infections and cascade infections. It aims to be an

easy-to-use tool and meet the most important needs of virologists
and computational biologists.

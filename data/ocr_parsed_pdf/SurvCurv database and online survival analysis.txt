Abstract

Summary: Understanding the biology of ageing is an important and complex challenge. Survival
experiments are one of the primary approaches for measuring changes in ageing. Here, we pre—
sent a major update to Suerurv, a database and online resource for survival data in animals.
As well as a substantial increase in data and additions to existing graphical and statistical
survival analysis features, Suerurv now includes extended mathematical mortality modelling
functions and survival density plots for more advanced representation of groups of survival

cohorts.

Availability and implementation: The database is freely available at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton—

1 Introduction

The biological phenomenon of ageing has been a long standing area
of research (Grignolio and Franceschi, 2012). Despite identification
of many gene knock-outs, drug administration and environmental
regimes that can extend lifespan of model organisms under labora-
tory conditions, many questions remain unresolved (Guarente et (11.,
2008). A key experimental approach in research on ageing is to use
longevity survival experiments, which usually characterize differ-
ences with respect to ageing between populations when other causes
of death, such as predators, food competition and pathogens, are
excluded. Until recently, numerical data from animal survival ex-
periments were usually not shared, and the data were analysed only
in the original study, hampering method development, re-analysis of
existing data by new methods, meta-analyses combining data and
systems biology approaches.

We have created the Suerurv database and online analysis plat-
form for animal survival data (Ziehm and Thornton, 2013). Here,
we present a major Suerurv update, comprising improvements and
new analysis features as well as increased data content.

2 Description

Suerurv is a database and analysis platform accessible through its
user-friendly web interface at https://www.ebi.ac.ul</thornton-srv/
databases/Suerurv/. The main website gives access to the database
through a search box, querying the manually curated annotations of
experimental conditions and treatments. Annotations use existing
databases and ontologies, where possible, and advanced searches
using specific database fields are available. All data from the data-
base can be analysed online and additional user data can be analysed

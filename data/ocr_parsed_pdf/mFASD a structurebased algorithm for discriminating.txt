Abstract

Motivation: A large number of proteins contain metal ions that are essential for their stability and
biological activity. Identifying and characterizing metal—binding sites through computational meth—
ods is necessary when experimental clues are lacking. Almost all published computational
methods are designed to distinguish metal—binding sites from non—metal—binding sites. However,
discrimination between different types of metal—binding sites is also needed to make more accurate
predictions.

Results: In this work, we proposed a novel algorithm called mFASD, which could discriminate dif—
ferent types of metal—binding sites effectively based on 3D structure data and is useful for accurate
metal—binding site prediction. mFASD captures the characteristics of a metal—binding site by inves—
tigating the local chemical environment of a set of functional atoms that are considered to be in
contact with the bound metal. Then a distance measure defined on functional atom sets enables
the comparison between different metal—binding sites. The algorithm could discriminate most
types of metal—binding sites from each other with high sensitivity and accuracy. We showed that
cascading our method with existing ones could achieve a substantial improvement of the accuracy
for metal—binding site prediction.

1 Introduction

 

Proteins usually execute their functions by interacting with other
components, including macromolecules such as DNA and proteins
as well as small cofactors among which metals are most frequently
used. Approximately, one—third of all proteins contain at least one
metal ion according to the data in Protein Data Bank (PDB;
Bernstein et (11., 1977; Holm et (11., 1996; Matthews at 111., 2008).
Binding of metal ions is known to have profound effect on the over—
all protein conformation, where metals contribute significantly to
proteins’ stability and biochemical activity. On one hand, metals are

often directly involved in chemical reactions by serving as redox cen—
ters or electrophilic reactants in catalysis and helping to bring react—
ive groups into correct orientations for reactions (Lin et (11., 2005).
On the other hand, metals play a significant role in signal transduc—
tion and conformational changes of proteins by switching from state
to state since they have different valence states (Williams et (11.,
1985). Thus, identifying metal—binding sites could be a key step in
understanding the function mechanisms of metal—binding proteins.
Experimental approaches to detect whether a protein binds a
specific metal ion include atom absorption spectroscopy (Reed and

Poyner 2000), metal—affinity column chromatography (Herald et (11.,
2003), mass spectrometry (Binet et (11., 2003) and so on. Although,
these methods can provide definite evidence about the presence of a
specific metal in a protein, they all need professional equipment and
complicated steps thus are cost—expensive and time—consuming.
Therefore, it is necessary to develop computational tools to predict
metal—binding sites with high accuracy and sensitivity.

Various methods have been proposed in literature to predict
metal—binding sites. Among them, some try to predict metal—binding
sites based on sequence information and others depend on 3D struc—
ture information to achieve the goal. For example, a method using the
sequence profiles of known metal—binding domains deposited in PDB
has been reported and applied to prediction of copper binding pro—
teins (Andreini et (11., 2009). Fold—X force field (Schymkowitz et (11.,
2005) and CHED (Babor et (11., 2008) are two representatives for
structure—based algorithms. The former predicts the spatial position of
a metal ion in a protein by searching in a library that contains the spa—
tial positions of metal ions relative to the corresponding ligating
atoms. The latter predicts metal—binding sites based on statistically
derived geometric constrains of different metal—binding sites. There
are also many other methods. To name a few, TEMSP is specialized in
zinc—binding sites prediction by recognizing residue triads specific for
zinc sites (Zhao et (11., 2011). SitePredict is able to identify metal—bind—
ing sites as well as small ligand pockets by using a random forest clas—
sifier (Babor et (11., 2008). The fragment transformation method (Lu
et (11., 2012) can predict metal—binding sites by searching a template li—
brary of metal—binding residues. Recently, a web server called
CheckMyMetal (CMM; Zheng et (11., 2014) has been reported to sup—
port sophisticated evaluation of metal—binding sites in macromolecules
structures by using a set of parameters derived from 7350 metal—bind—
ing sites of 2304 high resolution structures.

However, most of the methods mentioned above are designed to
discriminate between metal—binding sites and non—metal—binding
sites instead of different types of metal—binding sites. For example,
CHED can be used to predict metal—binding sites for a wide range of
metal ions, but the predicted binding sites can bind any other metal
ions in theory. Methods predicting one or two specific types of metal
ions, like TEMSP (for Zn) and FEATURE (for Zn and Ca; Ebert and
Altman, 2008), only tell the sites binding these metal ions from
those not binding these metals. The CMM web server can provide
alternative metal suggestions for users when suspecting incorrect
metal assignment, but it does not show specific functionality to dis—
criminate different metal—binding sites. In other words, no effective
methods are available to discriminate metal—binding sites that bind
different types of metal ions. SitePredict has tried to distinguish dif—
ferent metal—binding sites, however, its performance seems not satis—
fied and needs to be improved (Babor et (11., 2008). There may be
two main reasons why it is hard to discriminate different types of
metal—binding sites. First, the cavity holding a metal ion is often very
small so that only limited information is included. It is worth men—
tioning that the types of residues involved in metal binding are ra—
ther restricted, often concentrating upon CYS, HIS, ASP and GLU
(Golovin et (11., 2005; Auld et (11., 2001). This fact makes it difficult
to discriminate metal—binding sites of different types of metals espe—
cially on residue level. Second, the surroundings of metal ions are
similar to each other due to the similarity of properties of metal
ions. Some experiments have proved that the binding sites for one
specific type of metal can also bind other type of metals (Bock et (11.,
1999). It is known that one of the most prevalent Ca2+ binding
motifs, the EF—hand motif, can also bind Mg2+ in some cases
(Lewit—Bentley and Rety, 2000), thus making it hard to tell one from
another.

In this work, we proposed a novel algorithm based on 3D struc—
ture information called mFASD, which can discriminate different
types of metal—binding sites at atom level and is effective in distin—
guishing proteins that bind different types of metal ions. In mFASD,
a metal—binding site was modeled as an atom set, called functional
atom set (FAS), and the associated local chemical environment,
which is similar to the minimal functional site proposed by Andreini
et al. (2011, 2013). Each atom in a FAS was considered to be in con—
tact with the metal ion situated in the metal—binding site.
Considering that the binding environments for different types of
metals are different at atom level, it is possible to discriminate FASs
that bind different types of metals based on proper distance meas—
ure. The algorithm achieves this goal by introducing a distance met—
ric called functional atom set distance (FASD) that is to be explained
in detail in the next section. mFASD attained good performance in
distinguishing most types of metal—binding sites from each other. We
exemplified potential applications of mFASD by (i) cascading it with
CHED and SitePredict, respectively, which leaded to a substantial
improvement of metal—binding site prediction; (ii) applying it to pre—
dict the metals contained in two protein structures solved by our
labs thus providing useful information for structural biologists.

2 Methods

2.1 Description of the algorithm

The workﬂow of the algorithm is shown in Figure 1. Brieﬂy, we pre—
sented a metal—binding site as a set of functional atoms that were
considered to contact the metal ion. For each atom in the FAS, we
described its local chemical environment by integrating information
of its chemical property and the chemical properties of atoms in its
neighborhood, based on which a distance measure between two
functional atoms was defined. We transformed the problem of com—
paring two metal—binding sites as comparing two corresponding
FASs. We calculated the FASD between two FASs by all—versus—all
comparison between the functional atoms in the two FASs. Two
FASs were classified as the same metal—binding type, if their distance
was smaller than a predefined threshold. For each type of metal—
binding site, we constructed a reference FAS set. To determine
whether a metal—binding site could bind a certain type of metal, indi—
vidual comparison of the query FAS with the reference FASs were
combined to generate the final decision by taking a simple majority
vote.

Step 1: Extraction of functional atoms from a metal-binding protein
We defined atoms situated within a distance of r from the metal ion
as functional atoms (also known as donor atoms). In this work, a
value of 3.5A was adopted for r by referring to Lu’s work (Lu et (11.,
2012). Therefore, a metal—binding site of a metalloprotein could be
extracted and presented as a functional atom set or a FAS. It was
worth mentioning that only those sites containing single metal ions
were considered here. For example, among the several different
types of Fe—containing sites, namely single iron ions, ion—sulfur clus—
ters and heme groups, only the first type was covered in the present
study.

Step 2: Extraction of local chemical environment of a functional
atom

We captured the characteristics of local chemical environment of a
functional atom F from two aspects, the chemical property of F itself
and the chemical properties of atoms in the neighborhood of F. We
used the atom type of F as the descriptor of its chemical property

directly. To describe the neighborhood of F, we adopted a coarse—
grained description. We classified atoms into six categories accord—
ing to their chemical properties: (i) hydrophibic, (ii) acceptor, (iii)
donor, (iv) hydrophobic, (v) aromatic and (vi) neutral (Sobolev
et al., 1996). In this way, the chemical property of a neighboring
atom of F could be expressed as its chemical category. We defined
that if an atom A is within a distance of 5.0A to F, it is considered
to interact with F. The F—A interactions reﬂect the chemical proper—
ties of atoms in the neighborhood of F. We presented each F—A
interaction as a tuple (i, j) of the corresponding chemical categories,
where i and 1' denote the possible chemical category values of F and
the interacting atom A, respectively. Since there are six chemical cat—
egories, the distribution of the number of F—A interactions could be
described using a 36—dimensional vector

functional atom described above, we defined the distance between
two functional atoms F1 and F2 as

DPAD(F1,F2) = to X d]: + (1 — to) X dN

The functional atom distance (FAD), DFAD, consists of two
parts, dp and dN. dp accounts for the atom type difference between
the two functional atoms. If the two atom types are the same, dp is
zero, else dp equals 1. dN quantifies the difference of F—A interaction
distributions between the two functional atoms. dN ranges from
zero to one. The minimal value is reached, when the two functional
atoms have the same distributions of F—A interactions, suggesting
the high similarity of their neighborhood. In contrast, the maximal
value of dN indicates that the two functional atoms have completely

different distributions of F—A interactions and therefore distinct
neighborhood. Parameter w was introduced to control the ratio of
contribution of the functional atom itself to that of its neighborhood
and was determined through training.

Step 4: Calculation of distance between two FASs

To compare two FASs S1 and 52, we constructed a complete bipart—
ite graph. Each vertex of the graph is a functional atom. Each edge
represents comparison between two functional atoms from S1 and
S; respectively, and is weighted using the corresponding DFAD value
that quantifies the distance between the two functional atoms. We
defined the distance between S1 and 52, called functional atom set
distance or FASD, as follows

DFASD(SLSZ) : Z minF)ESz(DFAD(Fi7F))/lsll7
ass,

where the numerator sums up the minimal DFAD from each func—
tional atom in S1 to those in $2, and the denominator is the number
of functional atoms in S1. Therefore, D1: ASD reﬂects the average min—
imal DFAD from S1 to 52.

Step 5: Classification of a metal-binding site

Based on FASD, the similarity between two metal—binding sites
could be evaluated by calculating the DFASD between their corres—
ponding FASs. Two metal—binding sites are regarded to be of the
same metal—binding type, if their DFAD is lower than a threshold t.
The proper value of t was determined through training.

To determine whether a query protein could bind a specific type
of metal M, we constructed a reference FAS set RM for the corres—
ponding metal and compared the FAS Q of the query protein against
the reference set RM. Individual comparison between the query FAS
Q and the reference FASs in RM were then combined to generate the
final decision by taking a simple majority vote. Concretely, if more
than half of the FASs in the reference set RM were judged to be of
the same metal—binding type as the query FAS Q, the query protein
was determined to be a member of M—binding proteins, otherwise its
membership was rejected.

To construct the reference FAS sets for different types of metals,
we downloaded non—redundant protein structures from
PDBSelect25 (Griep et al., 2010), the sequence identity of which
was less than 25%. We kept structures containing at least one of the
following six types of metals, i.e. Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Zn and Ca. FASs
were then extracted from these structures. Six reference FAS sets,
one for each metal type, were constructed by separating FASs bind—
ing different types of metals into different sets, namely RZ", RFe,
RC“, RM", RC3 and RMg.

As described above, FASs with explicitly bound metal ions could
be extracted from protein structures directly. However, a query pro—
tein might have no clear clue of metal binding, for example, a newly
solved crystal structure without any bound metal ions. In this case,
there are two means to extract candidate FASs from the query pro—
tein. First, one can construct a FAS by searching cavities that are
suitable to hold a metal ion. Second, there are many existing meth—
ods for metal—binding site prediction, some of which provide details
of residues that might bind a metal ion. The side—chain atoms of
these predicted residues could be assigned to the FAS of the query
protein.

2.2 Performance assessment
To evaluate the capability of our method to discriminate the binding
sites of P from those of N, where P denotes a certain metal type and

N denotes any metal type that is different from P or a set of metal
types excluding P, we prepared a FAS set R :{RP, RN}. For each
FAS R,- in R, we trained the classifier of metal type P using the rest
FASs in R and determined whether R,- can bind P. Suppose R,- was
drawn from RP. If R,- was determined to bind P, then R,- was counted
as a true positive (TP), otherwise a false negative. Suppose R,- was
drawn from RN. R,- was counted as a false positive (FP), if R,- was
determined to bind P, otherwise a true negative. True positive rate
(TPR) or sensitivity and false positive rate (FPR) or selectivity were
then calculated according to the following equations:

7 #TP
TPR _ #TP + #FN
i #FP
PPR — #FP + #TN

Based on the computed (FPR, TPR) pairs under different values
of t, an ROC curve could be plotted. An AUC score was obtained by
integrating the area under the corresponding ROC curve. Generally,
a better algorithm has a higher AUC score. The highest AUC score
of 1.0 is reached, when a method could correctly tell all the binding
sites of P from those of N. For a random classifier, its AUC score
equals 0.5, indicating no capability of discriminating different types
of metal—binding sites.

3 Results

3.1 Determination of parameters

In the mFASD algorithm, two parameters are adjustable. The first
one is the w in DFAD, which determines the ratio of contribution of
the functional atom itself to that of its neighborhood. The second is
the threshold t for determining whether two FASs are of the same
metal—binding type. To obtain appropriate values of these two par—
ameters for the classifier of a certain metal type M, we scanned the
support of the parameters and evaluated the performance of the
classifier for discriminating M—binding sites from other non—M—bind—
ing sites under different parameter values (Section 2).

Here, we exemplified the procedure of parameter determination
for zinc—binding site classifier. We first prepared the FAS set
R : {RP, RN}, where P:Zn and N: {Fe, Cu, Mn, Ca, Mg}. Then,
we scanned the parameter w from 0.1 to 0.9 with a step of 0.1. For
every value of w, the AUC score was computed. It was found that
the AUC score reached three peaks 0.890, 0.878 and 0.881, when w
was equal to 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8, respectively (Fig. 2a). The high AUC
scores indicated that our method performed well in discriminating
zinc—binding sites from other metal—binding sites. We further investi—
gated the corresponding ROC curves (Fig. 2b). Apparently, when w
was equal to 0.8, the highest sensitivity (TPR) could be achieved
with the selectivity (FPR) kept at a certain low level (usually 0.05).
Taking this factor into account, 0.8 was finally taken as the value
for parameter to to classify zinc—binding and non—zinc—binding sites.
The value 0.3 of t corresponding to the point (0.7, 0.05) of (TPR,
FPR) was then taken as a suitable choice of t. For the other five types
of metals, the values for w and t were determined in the same way.

3.2 Discrimination of different metal—binding sites

After the parameters were determined, we also evaluated the per—
formance of mFASD to discriminate binding sites of two different
metal types (Section 2). As shown in Table 1, binding sites of most
metal types could be discriminated from each other with an AUC
score higher than 0.7. For instance, for proteins binding Zn, our
method could distinguish them from proteins binding other five

0.831, 0.722, 0.886, 0.937 and 0.906, respectively. Another fre—
quently used metal type, Ca, could also be identified from other five
metal types Fe, Cu, Mn, Zn and Mg with high AUC scores of 0.904,
0.908, 0.917, 0.859 and 0.783, respectively.

However, our method failed to achieve satisfied discrimination
in some cases. For example, the AUC score of discriminating Ca
binding sites from Mg binding sites was close to 0.5. Discrimination
between Fe and Mn binding sites and discrimination between Zn
and Cu binding sites were also difficult as indicated by the AUC
scores lower than 0.7. As discussed in the Section 1, some proteins
that bind one type of metal could also bind other types of metals.
Although, our method performed well for discriminating most bind—
ing sites of different metal types from each other, it could not handle
proteins with versatile binding sites that could bind more than one
type of metal.

3.3 Applications (I)

In this section, we discussed how our method could be applied to
improving the accuracy of metal—binding site prediction of existing
methods. Most algorithms in literature showed no or poor capabil—
ity to discriminate different types of metal—binding sites, while our

The non-symmetric discrimination performance resulted from the differ-
ence of positive set and negative set. For example, for Zn—Fe AUC, Zn is the
positive set and Fe is the negative, while for Fe-Zn AUC, Fe is the positive set
and Zn is the negative set. The phenomenon was consistent with the report of
SitePredict (Babor et al., 2008)

method could reduce FPs of these algorithms by identifying proteins
that were wrongly predicted to bind a certain metal type. In add—
ition, for approaches just predicting the presence of a metal—binding
site in a protein, our method could give further information about
whether the predicted site could bind a specific metal. Here, we took
SitePredict and CHED, two state—of—the—art methods in literature, as
examples to illustrate the cascading of our method with existing
algorithms.

SitePredict was proposed to predict metal—binding sites and other
small ligand binding sites by using a random forest classifier (Babor
et al., 2008). We randomly chose 100 structures containing different
types of metal ions from PDB that had been clustered using CD—Hit
program (Li et al., 2006) at 30% sequence identity (Supplementary
Table S1). Zinc—binding sites were predicted for these proteins using
SitePredict. 30 structures were predicted to bind Zn, 14 of which
were wrong (Supplementary Table S2). We delivered all the predic—
tions to mFASD. For the wrongly predicted Zn binding sites, 1, 1, 2,
4 and 6 were in fact found to bind Fe, Mg, Mn, Cu and Ca, respect—
ively. It was found that eleven FPs could be excluded by mFASD ex—
cept three (1G8K_A, 1PU4_A and 1D6U_A) (Supplementary Table
S2). We carefully inspected the local configurations of the predicted
metal—binding sites of these three proteins. Both 1PU4_A and
1D6U_A contain a Cu in the predicted sites, which consist of three
HISs to coordinate with the metal (Fig. 3a, b) just like many

zinc—binding sites for instance 1M68_A (Fig. 3c). So these two sites
also had the potential to bind a zinc ion. In contrast, 1G8K_A does
not bind any metal ions in the predicted site of the PDB structure.
However, its local configuration is very similar to the above two
binding sites (Fig. 3d). Therefore, there is a high probability that the
predicted site could bind Zn as well. For the rest 16 TP 5 predicted
by SitePredict, 15 were determined as zinc binding correctly by
mFASD (Supplementary Table S2). Apparently, our method dramat—
ically reduced the FPs of SitePredict for predicting zinc—binding sites
and made metal—binding site prediction more accurate.

CHED could be applied to predicting intra—chain metal—binding
sites for transition metals. Here, we showed how our method could
improve the prediction of CHED by taking zinc—binding sites as an
example. We randomly selected 90 structures containing different
metals from PDB that had been clustered using CD—Hit program at
30% sequence identity (Supplementary Table S3). Metal—binding
sites in these proteins were predicted using CHED, which gave 115
metal—binding sites. Among these predicted metal—binding sites, 51
were confirmed to bind Zn and 64 were found to bind other metals
or nothing in the structures (Supplementary Table S4). We processed
these predictions with mFASD. Fifty out of the 51 Zn—binding sites
were correctly identified indicating a high sensitivity of our method

(Supplementary Table S4). For the rest 64 predictions that did not
bind Zn in their structures, 50 were correctly excluded by mFASD.
We inspected the 14 predictions not filtered out by our method
(Supplementary Table S4). Only four binding sites were observed to
bind other metals in their structures. Although, nothing was bound
in their structures, the remaining 10 binding sites might also be able
to bind Zn, since their local configurations are very similar to those
binding Zn. For example, the predicted metal—binding site in
1F6B_A contains two HIS and one ASP just as many Zn—binding
sites did (Fig. 3e). Also, the predicted binding site in 1LFG_A con—
sists of three CYSs that often appear in zinc motif (Fig. 3f). Our
method provided further information on the predicted metal—bind—
ing sites generated by CHED.

3.4 Applications (ll)

3KW7 (Fig. 3g) and 3OPX7 (Fig. 3h) were two protein structures
solved by other members of our labs, which contains Cu and Mg re—
spectively. Here, we took them as examples to show how mFASD
could be applied to predict the metals situated in the potential
metal—binding sites of newly determined structures thus providing
useful information for structural biologists. As described in the
Section 2, we constructed the FAS by manually extracting atoms
within 3.5A to the candidate position of the metal ion. We then
applied mFASD to predict the metals binding to the FAS. For
3KW7, only Cu was predicted to be present at the metal—binding
site, which was consistent with the experimental result. For 3OPX,
both Mg and Ca were predicted to be able to bind the FAS, although
only Mg was found in the structures. However, as we mentioned
above, Mg and Ca are hard to discriminate in some cases and pro—
teins binding Ca could also bind Mg (Lewit—Bentley and Rety,
2000). The accurate predictions given by mFASD could help a struc—
tural biologist to infer the functions and mechanisms of the studied
proteins.

4 Conclusions

In this work, a novel method was proposed to discriminate different
types of metal—binding sites at atom level. The method compared
two metal—binding sites using a metric called FASD, which evaluated
the similarity of atoms in contact with the metal ions in terms of
their local chemical environment. Despite some exceptions, our
method could discriminate most types of metal—binding sites from
each other very well. Since higher structure resolution brings more
accurate structural information which is important for metal—bind—
ing site prediction, structures with higher resolution are expected to
have better performance. Also, mFASD does not limit to experimen—
tal structures and should be applicable to homology models with
reasonable accuracy especially at the potential metal—binding sites.
As described in the method, the local environment of a metal—bind—
ing site is encoded as the distribution of chemical categories in the
neighborhood of the FAS. Despite of some loss of information, this
coarse—grained description endows mFASD with the robustness to
moderate structure ﬂexibility. From the methodological point of
view, the strategy adopted by mFASD could also be extended to
comparison of small ligand binding pockets, protein—protein inter—
action interfaces and protein—DNA/RNA binding regions.

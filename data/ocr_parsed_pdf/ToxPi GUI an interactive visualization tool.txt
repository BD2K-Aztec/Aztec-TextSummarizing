ABSTRACT

Motivation: Scientists and regulators are often faced with complex
decisions, where use of scarce resources must be prioritized using
collections of diverse information. The Toxicological Prioritization
Index (T oxPiTM) was developed to enable integration of multiple
sources of evidence on exposure and/or safety, transformed into
transparent visual rankings to facilitate decision making. The rankings
and associated graphical profiles can be used to prioritize resources in
various decision contexts, such as testing chemical toxicity or assess-
ing similarity of predicted compound bioactivity profiles. The amount
and types of information available to decision makers are increasing
exponentially, while the complex decisions must rely on specialized
domain knowledge across multiple criteria of varying importance.
Thus, the ToxPi bridges a gap, combining rigorous aggregation of
evidence with ease of communication to stakeholders.

Results: An interactive ToxPi graphical user interface (GUI) application
has been implemented to allow straightforward decision support
across a variety of decision-making contexts in environmental
health. The GUI allows users to easily import and recombine data,
then analyze, visualize, highlight, export and communicate ToxPi re-
sults. It also provides a statistical metric of stability for both individual
ToxPi scores and relative prioritized ranks.

Availability: The ToxPi GUI application, complete user manual and
example data files are freely available from http://comptox.unc.edu/

1 INTRODUCTION

Prioritization decisions must be made in any field where available
time, financial and logistical resources cannot address require-
ments (e. g. scientiﬁc, commercial or regulatory). Proper formu-
lation, evaluation and communication of such prioritizations
require effective decision support tools. The National Research
Council’s report Science and Decisions (NRC, 2009) underscored
the urgent need for safety testing of tens of thousands of com-
mercial chemicals that lack information on potential hazards to
human health. Effective prioritization of chemicals is needed to
bridge the gap between available knowledge and information

needed to meet legislative and public health mandates.
Prioritization of chemicals for screening is necessary for linking
downstream decisions with information from traditional toxicity
studies, as well as data from new high-throughput screening
(HTS) and other technologies (Rusyn et al., 2012). The
decision-making contexts typically revolve around two broad
types of questions: ‘In what order do we test chemicals?’ and
‘Which subsets of chemicals deserve speciﬁc, targeted tests?’

The ToxPi (Reif et al., 2010) approach addresses both of these
needs by yielding an explicit prioritized order of chemicals, as
well as a Visually interpretable and transparent weight-of-
evidence analysis. This approach can be tailored to diverse sets
of chemicals (or other entities of interest), evidence (data) and
prioritization tasks. Its initial applications have been to aid in the
prioritization and proﬁling of chemicals by integrating data from
in vitro assays, chemical properties and inferred biological path-
way activity collected for the ToxCastTM program (www.epa.
gov/ncct/toxcast).

2 FEATURES AND IMPLEMENTATION

The ToxPi GUI is implemented in Java (freely available from
http://www.java.com) to allow cross-platform sharing of data
and results. All installation details and features described here
are fully detailed in the user manual at the download site.

On opening the GUI, the main data screen (Home window) is
displayed. This screen includes buttons for adding data ﬁles, then
for selecting chemicals and data sources (‘components’) of inter-
est. Example data files in a simple spreadsheet-compatible
format are provided alongside the ToxPi application download.
If a single ToxPi-format ﬁle is selected, users can recreate an
entire ToxPi analysis in one-step. This functionality is for users
who wish to share analyses or adjust/explore analyses of others.
For new formulations, data from multiple ﬁles may be ﬂexibly
recombined from the Home window. The next step proceeds
through an explicit formulation of ToxPi components, slices (ag-
gregations of one or more individual data components), weights
(relative emphasis across slices of data), coloration and options
for mathematical scaling Via the Slices Information window.

The Results window shows the sortable ToxPi index values and
graphical proﬁles for all chemicals (Fig. 1, top panel). Users can
toggle between steps (Home or Slices Information) to modify
source data or formulation options. The entire set of results

Fig. 1. Example of relationship between Results and Chart windows. The
upper panel shows sorted ToxPi results, with the highlighted reference
chemical (rank #2) signiﬁed by the bold square and cross-hairs on the
lower panel. Inset: pop-up high-resolution window showing individual
chemical’s ToxPi and information

and parameters can be saved to an external spreadsheet-like ﬁle
for sharing, publication or later use. All ToxPi proﬁles can be
saved as an image, with individual proﬁles arranged in a sortable
grid at publication-quality resolution. Alternatively, particular
chemicals can be highlighted, with selected results saved.
Clicking on any chemical in the Results window brings up the
detailed Chemical window (inset in Fig. 1). For the selected chem-
ical, this window includes an exportable high-resolution ToxPi
image containing details of slice-wise scores, associated conﬁ-
dence intervals and scaling. To represent the proportion of miss-
ing data in each slice, a small inner circle near the origin is shaded.
Confidence intervals are calculated by bootstrap sampling of
the component values (source data) within each slice. The values
are sampled with replacement 1000 times, and a new ToxPi score
is calculated for each sample, yielding a distribution of boot-
strapped scores. The 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) is then esti-
mated from this distribution, with the upper and lower bounds
included in all tabular results and ToxPi graphics. These CI es-
timates convey the stability of results and make no distributional
assumptions. Effectively, the method described here will penalize
(by creating large CIs) slices that contain extreme outliers, rely on
few source components or combine measurements on discordant
numerical scales within a single slice. Such penalization is appro-
priate to convey inherent uncertainty and to provide incentives to
ﬁnd appropriately uniform scaling for within-slice measurements
or create additional slices to appropriately group data types.
The Chart window shows all results in the context of the entire
set of chemicals, where each square plots the ToxPi score for a

given chemical on the horizontal axis versus its relative rank on
the vertical axis (Fig. 1, lower panel). The dynamic chart displays
any combination of the following interactive capabilities: dis-
play/hide CI bars (score and/or rank); zoom in/out; pan/drag
in any direction; highlight chemicals within the distribution.
The Chart window is the graphical complement to the tabular
prioritization results, and it can be saved to a ﬁle at any step. If
users highlight appropriate reference chemicalsiakin to ‘stand-
ards’ in a typical experimentiwithin this distributional chart
and display CI bars, this window can be used to assess both
the quality (correct order of reference chemicals) and stability
(non-overlap of CI bars between key sections of the distribution)
of a given prioritization scheme.

3 IMPACT AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

ToxPi proﬁles could also be used for chemical read-across, analo-
gous to chemical structure-alert ‘likeness’ groupings. The
read-across can be implemented in terms of overall ToxPi bins/
clusters of chemicals having similar profiles, or subsets of slices
can be interpreted as ‘alerts’ (e. g. speciﬁc in vitro data) to support
targeted testing decisions or tiered assessment strategies. The
output of the ToxPi GUI can be directly used for such clustering
exercises, and tabular ﬁles can be saved for transparency.

The current applications of ToxPi have focused on prioritiza-
tion of chemicals; however, any units of categorization with
varied output proﬁles could be used. Thus, the application
may be used, for example, to compare groups of subjects
across clinical, molecular, behavioral, socio-economic indicators
and environmental data, facilitating additional novel integrated
analyses and displays. The major advantage of the ToxPi frame-
work stems from its ﬂexibility as diverse types of data can be
incorporated (e.g. personalized exposure measurements), and re-
sults can be updated as more information becomes available or if
the underlying assumptions on data integration strategies are
modiﬁed. This ﬂexibility comes with the same caveats as with
any generally useful analytical tool, whereby users must exercise
sound judgment in the numerical representation and intended
interpretation of input data.

Future prioritization approaches will have an increasing de-
mand for transparency and interactivity. This demand is driven
by pressures from a more informed public on both commercial
and government entities. Transparency in both data and models
is facilitated by web-accessible databases and software tools. The
interactive ToxPi prioritization interface allows formal input into
decisions by stakeholders, regulators and the public.

population structure from admixed genotype data

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Clustering of genotype data is an important way of
understanding similarities and differences between populations.
A summary of populations through clustering allows us to make
inferences about the evolutionary history of the populations. Many
methods have been proposed to perform clustering on multilocus
genotype data. However, most of these methods do not directly
address the question of how many clusters the data should be
divided into and leave that choice to the user.

Methods: We present StructHDP, which is a method for
automatically inferring the number of clusters from genotype data
in the presence of admixture. Our method is an extension of two
existing methods, Structure and Structurama. Using a Hierarchical
Dirichlet Process (HDP), we model the presence of admixture of
an unknown number of ancestral populations in a given sample of
genotype data. We use a Gibbs sampler to perform inference on the
resulting model and infer the ancestry proportions and the number
of clusters that best explain the data.

Results: To demonstrate our method, we simulated data from an
island model using the neutral coalescent. Comparing the results
of StructHDP with Structurama shows the utility of combining HDPs
with the Structure model. We used StructHDP to analyze a dataset of
155 Taita thrush, Turdus helleri, which has been previously analyzed
using Structure and Structurama. StructHDP correctly picks the
optimal number of populations to cluster the data. The clustering
based on the inferred ancestry proportions also agrees with that
inferred using Structure for the optimal number of populations. We
also analyzed data from 1048 individuals from the Human Genome
Diversity project from 53 world populations. We found that the
clusters obtained correspond with major geographical divisions of
the world, which is in agreement with previous analyses of the
dataset.

Availability: StructHDP is written in C++. The code will be available

1 INTRODUCTION

The clustering of individuals into populations is a frequently
undertaken task in studies of genetic data. Clustering allows
the summarization of individuals into groups based on genetic
similarity. Such a summary is easy to visualize and understand.
It enables us to make simple inferences about the similarities and
differences between different groups of individuals. We can also
make inferences about evolutionary history of populations. An
understanding of the population stratiﬁcation present in a set of

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

individuals is also required for avoiding false positives in genetic
association studies.

Phenomena like migration and admixture make the clustering
problem harder, since individuals need not belong to exactly one
population cluster, but can have partial membership in multiple
clusters. Different parts of an individual’s genome can be inherited
from individuals belonging to different populations. The problem of
clustering individuals while allowing partial membership in multiple
clusters was addressed using a Bayesian model by Pritchard et al.
(2000). Extensions to the underlying model that account for other
evolutionary processes such as mutation (Shringarpure and Xing,
2009) and recombination (Falush et al., 2003) have also been
proposed.

An important question that needs to be addressed when solving
the problem of population stratiﬁcation is deciding how many
populations are required to best explain the variation observed in
a given set of individuals. The Bayesian models mentioned earlier
require the user to specify a number of clusters (also called ancestral
populations) into which the individuals are divided. However,
this might not always be possible or desirable. To address this
problem, an extension of Structure was developed by Pella and
Masuda (2006). Based on their method, Huelsenbeck and Andolfatto
(2007) developed Structurama. Structurama automatically infers
the number of population clusters into which a given dataset
should be divided provided individuals only belong to a single
population. A commonly used solution to this problem is to use
ﬁxed-dimensionality models in combination with an information
criterion (Akaike, 1974; Schwarz, 1978) to decide the optimal
number of populations.

In this article, we present StructHDP, a method for automatically
inferring the number of population clusters present in a group
of individuals, while accounting for admixture between ancestral
populations. Using the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process framework for
clustering developed by Teh et al. (2006), we extend the Structure
model so that the number of populations is inferred by the model and
need not be speciﬁed by the user. This work is also an extension of
the Dirichlet process model developed by Pella and Masuda (2006),
which has been implemented in Structurama.

We simulated data from an island model using the neutral
coalescent to test the performance of our method at recovering
the true number of ancestral populations. Comparing the results
of StructHDP with Structurama shows the utility of combining
HDPs with the Structure model. We used StructHDP to analyze
a set of 155 Taita thrush individuals, Turdus helleri. This dataset
has been previously analyzed using Structure and Structurama.
We found that StructHDP correctly identiﬁes the optimal number
of populations to cluster the data. The clustering enforced by the
inferred ancestry proportions for individuals also agrees with that
inferred using Structure with the appropriate choice of the number

of populations K. We also analyzed a set of 1048 individuals from
the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP) using StructHDP.
We found that the clusters inferred coincide with the major
geographical divisions present in the data. We also observed that the
distance between populations (based on their cluster memberships)
is strongly positively correlated with F 5; between populations, which
suggests that the inferred cluster memberships capture the genetic
variation present in the data well.

2 RELATED WORK

Model-based clustering methods have become popular since the
Structure model by Pritchard et al. (2000). The method uses a
Bayesian model to capture admixture in populations, with model
parameters inferred by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
sampling. Extensions to the underlying model that account for
other evolutionary processes such as mutation (Shringarpure and
Xing, 2009) and recombination (Falush et al., 2003) have also been
proposed. These methods have the advantage that they use an explicit
demographic model of population stratiﬁcation. However, they are
not efﬁcient for large datasets.

Population clustering methods have also been developed in
a complementary direction, using low-dimensional projections
and eigenanalysis to cluster individuals (Patterson et al., 2006).
These methods assume no underlying evolutionary model but have
been shown to be good at modeling population structure. They
are efﬁcient and also allow the user to compute the statistical
signiﬁcance of the results obtained.

Recently, a set of methods such as Admixture (Alexander et (11.,
2009) and Frappe (Tang et al., 2005) have been developed
that use the likelihood model of Structure but use faster
optimization methods for estimating model parameters. Frappe
uses an expectation—maximization algorithm to determine individual
ancestries. Admixture uses a block relaxation algorithm to speed up
the optimization. Both these models are faster than Structure and
allow the analysis of large datasets with hundreds of thousands of
markers.

In all the models mentioned above, an important choice that
must be made by the user is the number of populations (K) or
clusters that the dataset must be divided into. To help the user
make this choice, some methods provide an approximation to the
posterior probability of the number of populations given in the data.
Alternatively, the user can use information criterion such as the
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (Akaike, 1974) or the Bayesian
Information Criterion (BIC) (Schwarz, 1978) to choose the number
of populations that best explain the data. The choice of number of
populations is a trade-off between model expressiveness (how well
the model captures the variation in the data) and model complexity
(how many parameters the model needs to capture the variation).

Huelsenbeck and Andolfatto (2007) developed an extension to
Structure, called Structurama, that automatically infers the number
of populations that are present in the data. Their method assumes that
an individual only belongs to a single cluster and that the number
of populations is also a random variable. They use a Dirichlet
process prior to infer the number of populations automatically.
Coalescent simulations by Huelsenbeck and Andolfatto (2007) using
island models show that inference of the number of populations is
accurate when migration rates are low and differentiation between
populations is high.

We propose to extend the Structure model beyond Structurama to
allow for admixture between ancestral populations. An individual
can have membership in multiple clusters and the number of
populations will automatically be inferred by the model. In the
following sections, we describe the model and discuss the results
of analyzing some simulated and real data using StructHDP.

3 APPROACH

Bayesian models for clustering of genotype data use the framework
of mixture models to model individuals. In a mixture model, an
individual is assumed to be made up of a number of genetic markers.
Each of those markers is assumed to originate from one of a ﬁnite
number of ancestral populations. Ancestral populations are usually
deﬁned as a collection of allele frequencies at the markers under
consideration. An individual can thus be considered to be a mixture
of one or more ancestral populations, which explicitly accounts
for admixture between populations. The proportions of different
populations within an individual’s genome are usually individual
speciﬁc and provide a compact summary of the individual’s genome.
This is the basis of the Structure model by Pritchard et al. (2000).

We approach the problem of ﬁnding the optimal number of
ancestral populations by extending the above model to a setting
where there are potentially inﬁnite ancestral population components
in the mixture. Performing inference then allows us to examine the
number of ancestral populations that have a non-zero contribution to
the set of individuals under consideration. We use the Hierarchical
Dirichlet Process framework (Teh et al., 2006) to model the mixture
of inﬁnite ancestral populations.

Consider the problem of clustering the markers within a single
individual based on their population of origin. We can assume that
the number of populations that contribute to the single individual’s
genome is unknown and is a random variable. The Dirichlet process
(DP) (Ferguson, 1973) was proposed to solve a problem of this
nature, where objects (genetic markers) belong to one of a potentially
inﬁnite number of mixture components (ancestral populations).
In the case of multiple individuals, we can posit multiple DPs,
one for each individual, that will address the problem of not
knowing the optimal number of populations. We also require that
the ancestral populations inferred for the DPs be the same across all
the individuals. Mathematically, this is analogous to ensuring that
mixture components are shared across DPs.

The Hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) is a framework for
clustering of observations when the observations are present in
groups. Each group can be modeled using a ﬁnite mixture model
or a DP. The mixture models or DPs across groups are linked by
sharing mixture components. It is useﬁil to think of each group as
having its own DP, with the processes linked to each other by the
parameters of the HDP. StructHDP is based on the HDP described by
Teh et al. (2006). In the following section, we provide a description
and mathematical representation of the HDP model.

4 METHODS

A commonly used analogy for representing HDPs is the Chinese Restaurant
Franchise (CRF). This is an extension of the representation of the DP as a
Chinese restaurant with customers. The DP representation and its application
to Structurama are described in more detail by Huelsenbeck and Andolfatto
(2007). A CRF comprises of a number of Chinese restaurants which share

a common (possibly inﬁnite) menu of dishes. In a CRF, each restaurant
corresponds to a group of observations, and the customers are observations.
The dishes served in the restaurant are the mixture components, and sharing
of mixture components across groups corresponds to sharing of dishes across
restaurants. In the CRF metaphor, a new customer (observation) arrives at
the restaurant corresponding to its group. The customer chooses a previous
occupied table in the restaurant with a probability proportional to the number
of customers already at the table or, with a constant probability, chooses a new
table. Every table serves a dish from the possible set of dishes, and every
customer at the table is assigned that particular dish, i.e. the observation
is assigned the particular mixture component that is associated with the
table. All observations that are assigned to a particular table are considered
to originate from the same mixture component, clustering the observations
within the group. The same mixture component might also be shared across
multiple tables within a group. The method of choosing a table for a new
customer is similar to a ‘rich gets richer” model which is regulated by the
probability of starting a new table. This is the property of the HDP that is
responsible for its clustering behavior.

This analogy can be easily extended to the case of genetic data, with every
individual considered to be a separate group corresponding to a restaurant.
The loci within an individual are the customers in the restaurant, and the
ancestral populations are the mixture components or the dishes in the CRF.
A minor subtlety that arises in this case is that the set of possible alleles at each
locus might be different, which needs to be accounted for in the inference
process. This can be accomplished easily with some minor bookkeeping
without changing the inference process signiﬁcantly.

Consider a dataset having N individuals genotyped at M loci. The observed
allele for individual j at locus i is denoted by 10,». For ease of representation,
we will ignore the diploid nature of genotype data. In implementation, we
shall allow our method to handle data of any ﬁxed ploidy. The HDP can then
be used to generate the allele xﬁ for the j-th individual at the i-th locus as
follows:

Gall/111’ N DPU/vHi)
GjlclotGo N DP(€¥0,G0)
ejilGj N Gj
inleﬁ N F(9ji)

Here, Hi is the base distribution over alleles at locus i, commonly a
Dirichlet distribution. y and 010 are parameters of the HDP that control
how fast new populations are added to the model. G0 is an intermediate
probability distribution over alleles at locus i and Gj is a distribution speciﬁc
to individual j. The individual-speciﬁc distributions Gj are connected to one
another through G0 and a0, ensuring the sharing of ancestral populations
across individuals. G0 and Gj are both generated by DP that use y and 010 as
parameters. The 9s denotes the mixture components. xﬁ is a sample from a
distribution F (617), a multinomial distribution over alleles in our case.

For modeling purposes, it is helpful to modify the representation of the
HDP so that the generative process looks as follows:

Ply N GEMW) (1)

“flaw/3 N DPWOJB) (2)
¢ik|Hi N Hi (3)

Zjilffj N JTj (4)

StructHDP. Nodes represent random variables and edges indicate
dependencies between random variables. The shaded circle indicates the
observed alleles. The dataset has N individuals, each genotyped at M loci.
For ease of representation, we do not show the ploidy of the individual in
the graphical model.

This construction ensures that 1 [3k :1. The [3 thus represents the
fractional contributions of the potentially inﬁnite populations to the given
set of individuals.

In the HDP representation above, ¢ik represents the allele frequencies of
the k-th population at the i-th locus. 71]— is a vector that denotes the ancestry
proportions (contributions from all populations) for individual j, and its
components sum to l. The indicator variable zji denotes which population
the observed allele xi,» at locus i originates from. We will use this notation for
representing the HDP model for our problem due to its similarity with the
Structure generative process. This representation also shows how the model
can account for diploid individuals by changing the step of sampling zji and
10,» to the following:

Zji,1|77j N W
Zji,2|77j N W
197,1 lei,lv(¢ik)]?:1 N F(¢z,,~,1)
xji,2lzji,2v(¢ik)]?:1 N F(¢z,,~,2)
where x1“ and x112 now represent the two alleles at locus i in individual
j and zji, 1 and zjm are their respective population indicator variables. This
allows the model to account for mixed ancestries at a single locus as well.
For ease of representation, we will drop the subscript indicating the ploidy
in the analysis.

Figure 1 shows the graphical model representation of the StructHDP
generative process. In this graphical model representation, the nodes
represent random variables which have been described earlier. The edges
denote dependencies between the random variables due to the sampling steps
in the generative process. The shaded nodes represent the random variables
we observe, namely, the alleles observed at each locus.

To allow for more ﬂexibility with the parameter settings, we impose priors
on 010, y and the base distributions Hi. We assume that 010 and y have Gamma
priors with parameters (amcxb) and (ya, 14,), respectively, and that Hi has a
symmetric Dirichlet distribution with parameter A. The graphical model with
all priors shown can be seen in Figure All in the Appendix A.

4.1 Inference

For performing inference on the model, we use Gibbs sampling, a MCMC
sampling method described for the HDP by Teh at al. (2006). For inference in
the CRF representation of the HDP, we create some bookkeeping variables
m that keep count of the number of tables at the restaurant and franchise
levels. More details about the distributions used for sampling the variables
are presented in the Appendix A.

4.2 Inference steps

Using all the variable updates, the inference process can be described as:

(1) Set the values for the prior parameters otth ya, 1%,)».

(2) Start with random values for all other variables.

(3) Sample z variables given all other variables.

(4) Sample m variables given all other variables, using updated value of z.
(5) Sample [3 given all other variables, using updated values of z and m.
(6) Sample 010 using updated values of z, m and 13.

(7) Sample y using updated values of all other variables.

(8) Repeat steps 377 until convergence.

The Gibbs sampling update distributions can be derived following the
methodology in Teh at al. (2006). Due to space limitations, the details of
the Gibbs sampling update distributions and their derivations are deferred to
the Appendix A.

4.3 Other inference details

Like all MCMC methods, the sampler is run for a large number of iterations,
with some initial iterations discarded as burn-in. Samples from the posterior
can then be used to estimate the ancestry proportions Jr]— for each individual.
The posterior distribution for the individual ancestry proportions 71]— can be
shown to be a Dirichlet distribution.

M
rt]-~Dir<...,a0ﬁk+ZI[zﬁ=k],...) (11)

[’21
where I[.] denotes an indicator function. If the number of populations
remains constant across iterations in the sampling (as is often seen to happen
in our experiments after a large number of iterations), this estimate can
be averaged over multiple samples to get a more accurate estimate of the

individual ancestry proportions.

As with the Gibbs sampler used in Structure, our method could have
problems with the identiﬁability of clusters, if label switching for the clusters
were a frequent occurrence. In practice, we ﬁnd that label switching is
infrequent, and is avoided by the use of the restricted growth function (RGF)
notation of Stanton and White (1986) in summarizing MCMC results.

5 RESULTS

5.1 Coalescent simulation data

We performed coalescent simulations based on an island model
similar to Huelsenbeck and Andolfatto (2007). We used the program
ms (Hudson, 2002) to simulate samples under a neutral coalescent
model. As an initial evaluation of the performance of StructHDP in
recovering the correct number of population clusters, we simulated
data from a symmetric equilibrium island model with 4 demes of
equal size, with the mutation rate 6=4Neu=05 and migration
rate M = 4Nem = {1,2,4}. In each case, 100 diploid individuals were
sampled with an equal number being sampled from each deme. Fifty
replicates were created for each parameter setting.

We analyzed the data using StructHDP, Structurama and
Admixture. For StructHDP, the priors for both concentration
parameters were set to (0.5.0.5) and the parameter for the Dirichlet
distribution of H was set to 0.5. The StructHDP Gibbs sampler was
run for 25 000 iterations, with the ﬁrst 12500 iterations discarded
as burn-in. To thin the Markov chain, samples were taken every
25 iterations. We computed the expected value of the number of
populations, K, using the sampled values of K from the Gibbs
sampler. The expected value of K, E(K IX) can then be compared

Admixture

The 50 replicates, consisting of 100 diploid individuals each, were sampled from a
4-deme symmetric island model, with 9:05 and M = {1,2,4}. The error in recovering
the number of demes is shown, as computed by the error measure E(E(K|X)— KT).

against the true value of the number of demes, KT=4, across
multiple replicates, to get an error measure that is given by
E (E (K |X )—KT) (Huelsenbeck and Andolfatto, 2007).

For Structurama, the experiments for each parameter setting
were performed with different priors on the expected number of
populations in Huelsenbeck and Andolfatto (2007). For comparison
purposes, we chose the best result, i.e. the prior setting that gave
the least error. Model selection with Admixture can be done in
three different ways by choosing either the AIC, BIC or the cross-
validation error as the measure of model ﬁt. We present results for
all three measures.

Table 1 shows the results of the simulation. We can see that
the error in recovering K is much smaller for StructHDP than for
Structurama and for Admixture, except when the migration rate is
small. The underlying assumption of the DP model of Structurama
is that there is no admixture and individuals only belong to a single
ancestral population. As a result, in a simulation setting with less
admixture due to migration, the number of recovered populations
for Structurama is almost perfect. As the amount of admixture
increases, the error in the number of recovered populations increases.
On the other hand, StructHDP explicitly accounts for admixture in
the model. Therefore, it recovers the true number of demes in the
island model with low error for all parameter values. In terms of
F st, we can say that as the F” between the demes decreases (as
migration increases), the accuracy of Structurama drops while that
of StructHDP is nearly unaffected.

Admixture performs worse than both StructHDP and Structurama
in recovering the true number of populations. This may be due to
the small number of markers that are used in the simulation study.

5.2 Real data analysis

5.2.1 Taita thrush data We used our method to analyze a dataset
of N = 155 Taita thrush, Turdus helleri (Galbusera et al., 2000). Each
individual was genotyped at M :7 microsatellite loci. Individuals
were sampled at four locations in southeast Kenya [Chawia (17
individuals), Ngangao (54), Mbololo (80) and Yale (4)]. The thrush
data were previously analyzed in Huelsenbeck and Andolfatto
(2007); Pritchard et al. (2000) so we use it to verify the correctness
of StructHDP.

We ran StructHDP for 25 000 iterations, with the ﬁrst 12 500
iterations as burn-in. Samples were taken every 25 iterations to thin
the Markov chain. The priors for both concentration parameters were

set to (0.5.0.5) and the parameter for the Dirichlet distribution of H
was set to 0.5.

We ﬁnd that our method converges to K = 3 populations in a few
thousand iterations. The posterior distribution for K is shown in
Figure 2. From the posterior, we can see that K :3 is the most
likely value for K. Figure 3 shows a single sample for the ancestry
proportions of the thrush data. The clusters agree with geographical
labels well except for a few individuals. We also see that the four Yale
individuals fall into the same cluster as the Ngangao individuals.
All these ﬁndings agree with those of Pritchard et al. (2000) when
Structure is initialized with K = 3 clusters. Figure 4 shows the results
of Structure analysis of the thrush data with K = 3. In their analysis,
Pritchard et al. also found that K = 3 explains the data best. Their
conclusion was based on an ad hoc approximation to Pr(K IX),
the posterior likelihood of K given the data X while StructHDP
automatically infers this from the data.

Diversity Project dataset we analyze consists of 1048 individuals
from 53 world populations genotyped at 783 microsatellite loci.

with the geographical divisions to which they belong. Using
Structure, Rosenberg et al. (2002) have previously analyzed the
genotype data and found that the population clusters correspond
to major geographical divisions of the world. We used StructHDP
to reanalyze this data (without making use of the geographical
information). The sampler was run for 20 000 iterations with the ﬁrst
10 000 iterations discarded as burn-in. Samples were taken every 25
iterations to thin the Markov chain.

To determine the optimal number of ancestral populations, we
examined the posterior distribution of the number of populations
(K). Figure 5 shows the posterior distribution. We ﬁnd the posterior
distribution has a single mode at K :4 and non-zero probability
mass for values of K up to 8. For further analyses, we use the
maximum-likelihood sample from the MCMC sampling, which has
four ancestral population components.

The contributions of the four ancestral populations to an
individual’s genome can be represented using a 4D vector whose
components sum to 1. All these vectors (referred to as ancestry
proportions) lie within a tetrahedron in 3D space. Each of the four
vertices of the tetrahedron represents an ancestral population. To
visualize the clustering, we plotted the ancestry proportions for the
1048 individuals in three dimensions along with the tetrahedron
in which the vectors lie. In this representation, the distance of a
vector from the vertices of the tetrahedron indicates the amount
of admixture present in an individual’s genome. The further away
from a vertex the vector is (and the closer it is to the center of
the tetrahedron), the more the admixture present in the individual’s
genome.

Figure 6 shows the resulting plot for the 1048 individuals in
the HGDP dataset. In the plot, each individual is represented by
a small sphere. For ease of interpretation, the individual spheres are
colored based on the geographical division they belong to. In the
populations we examine, the divisions are Africa, Americas, Central
and South Asia, East Asia, Europe, Middle East and Oceania. These
are represented by seven different colors. From the ﬁgure, we can see
that individuals from a single continent cluster together in the same
region of the tetrahedron. Some individual genomes are derived from
a single ancestral population and lie at the vertices of the tetrahedron.
Some other individuals, particularly those belonging to the Middle
Eastern, Central Asian and South Asian populations, show a lot of
admixture.

Population clustering with HDPs

 

To analyze these results further, we plotted the ancestry
proportions of the 1048 individuals as a bar graph, where every
individual is represented by a thin bar with four components which
sum to 1. Figure 7 shows the resulting bar graph. We can see that the
clusters obtained correspond to the major geographical divisions of
the world and the ancestral populations can be roughly described as
ancestral African (denoted by green color), ancestral American-East
Asian (blue), ancestral European (yellow) and ancestral Oceanian
(red). From the ancestry proportions, we can see that the modern
East Asian populations and American populations are similar, with
the modern East Asian populations having a larger contribution
from the ancestral population corresponding to Europe. Modern
Asian populations also show some Oceanic ancestry (from the
ancestral population denoted by red color). Modern Central and
South Asian populations show an admixture of European and East
Asian ancestral populations. The Middle Eastern populations show
contributions from the ancestral African population and the ancestral
European population. Modern Oceanic populations are an admixture
of an ancestral Oceanic population with an ancestral East Asian
population. All these observations are in agreement with previous
analyses of the data by Rosenberg et al. (2002) and other studies of
regional populations. We should note that the clusters inferred by
StructHDP are not identical to the ones observed by Rosenberg et al.

for K :4. Rosenberg et al. observe that East Asia separates out into
a separate cluster for K :4 while Oceania separates from the rest of
the data only for values of K larger than 4.

To analyze the similarity and differences within and between
continental divisions, we computed the mean ancestry proportions
for the seven continental divisions by averaging the ancestry
proportions for all individuals belonging to each continental
division. We then constructed a distance matrix by computing
the Euclidean distance between the 4D vectors representing each
continental division. Figure 8 shows the resulting distance matrix.
From the ﬁgure, we can see that the distance matrix has a block
structure. Modern American and East Asian populations are similar
to each other and show little separation. We also see that modern
European, Central South Asian and Middle Eastern populations
are close to each other. Within these three divisions, we see that
Europeans and Middle Eastern populations group together while
the Central South Asians are further apart.

We hypothesized that if the inferred ancestry proportions capture
the genetic variation between and across populations, then the
pairwise Euclidean distance computed earlier should be correlated
with genetic distance. To test this hypothesis, we computed the
pairwise F S; distance between the seven continental divisions of
the data. To test for correlation between the pairwise Euclidean
distance matrix and the pairwise F 5; distance matrix, we used a
Mantel test. AMantel test tests the alternate hypothesis of correlation
between two matrices against the null hypothesis of no correlation

by perrnuting the rows and columns of one of the matrices and
observing the distribution of the correlation statistic. The Mantel test
on the Euclidean and F 5; distance matrices shows that the correlation
between the two distance matrices is 0.57 (P=0.0025 with 10000
replicates). The distribution of the observed and simulated Mantel
correlation statistic is shown in Figure 9. Thus, we can see that
the Euclidean distance and F5; distance are strongly positively
correlated, which supports the inferred population structure.

To compare our results on the HGDP data with other methods, we
analyzed the data using Structurama. However, due to computational
reasons, we were unable to run Structurama on the full data at
optimal settings. Therefore, we analyzed a subset of the data that
included only 100 loci per individual. We found that the posterior
distribution of K inferred by Structurama has non-zero mass only at
K :5. Figure 10 shows the inferred ancestry proportions based on
the mean partition from Structurama. We can see that Structurama
also clusters the European, Middle Eastern and Central South Asian
populations into a single cluster. However, since it does not allow
partial membership, the individuals in different clusters have zero
similarity. It is, therefore, unable to model the partial similarity
between populations from different geographical divisions, e.g. the
Central Asian populations and European populations.

6 DISCUSSION

We have presented StructHDP, a method for automatically inferring
the number of population clusters present in a group of individuals
while accounting for admixture between populations. At the same
time, it also infers individual ancestry estimates under a Structure-
like model. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our method on data
simulated from an island model. We also analyzed the Taita thrush
dataset and demonstrated that StructHDP chooses the number of
clusters that best explain the data. Our analysis of the HGDP dataset
shows that our method is able to cluster populations even when
the individuals in the dataset are admixed. The ancestry proportions
inferred for populations can be used to compute a distance measure
between populations. We found that the Euclidean distance between
populations has a strong positive correlation with the FS; distance
between populations. The ancestry proportions, therefore, provide a
useful low-dimensional representation of populations.

Our method uses an HDP to model the admixture of an unknown
number of ancestral populations present in individual genomes in
a given dataset. We use an MCMC sampling algorithm, Gibbs
sampling, to estimate the model parameters. The number of ancestral
populations that best explain the data is one of the parameters of
our model. The collapsed Gibbs sampler we implemented according
to Teh et al. (2006) marginalizes the uncertainty in the population
allele frequencies, thus eliminating a possible source of error in the
inference. Our experiments suggest that the HDP is not sensitive to
the priors on the parameters do and y since we sample them in the
algorithm. The results are more sensitive to the choice of A for the
base distributions. A large value of A tends to produce populations
with uniform (high-entropy) allele frequency distributions while
a small value of A produces populations with allele frequency
distributions highly skewed in favor of very few alleles (low-
entropy). A complete sensitivity analysis, however, is beyond the
scope of this article. It would also be instructive to perform
simulations with more realistic and complex demographic models
to understand the limitations of StructHDP.

The model as described here can handle both single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) and microsatellite markers. However, one of
the limitations of our method is the computational time required
for the Gibbs sampling. This means that while our method can
handle datasets of a few thousand markers and individuals, it cannot
be efﬁciently used on large datasets of hundreds of thousands of
markers. However, as our simulations show, even with few loci,
the method performs well at recovering the number of populations
required to explain the data best. Teh et al. (2008) have described
a way of implementing collapsed variational inference for HDPs.

Population clustering with HDPs

 

Applying the variational inference algorithm to StructHDP would
improve its speed signiﬁcantly.

In this work, we have shown how the basic admixture model
can be extended to allow automatic inference of the number of
populations. Just as extensions to the Structure model that account
for recombination (Falush et al., 2003) and mutation (Shringarpure
and Xing, 2009) have been developed, we can also extend StructHDP
to model other evolutionary processes.

Genetic datasets are often accompanied by geographical
information about the genotyped individuals. In some cases, there is
a single geographical label associated with each individual, while in
others, there are labels at different resolutions (for example, region,
nation, continent). It has been shown that geographical distance
correlates well with genetic distance between populations (Cavalli-
Sforza et al., 1994; Novembre et al., 2008; Rarnachandran et al.,
2005). Therefore, the amount of sharing of ancestral population
components between modern population groups is likely to depend
on their geographical distance.

In its current form, StructHDP does not make use of geographical
information in the inference process. Teh et al. (2006) describe how
an HDP can be extended to include multiple levels of hierarchy
and be generalized to a tree-like hierarchy. Use of the hierarchical
geographical labels could allow us to impose a tree structure on the
dataset that respects the geographical labels and enforces a level of
population sharing among individuals that is consistent with their
geographical labels and distances.

APPENDIX A—INFERENCE AND ESTIMATION

The population allele frequencies at locus i are assumed to be
{(1)11 ,...,¢iK} where K can be inﬁnity and only a ﬁnite number of
the populations are used in the dataset. The prior over the allele
frequencies (M is Hi. In the restaurant analogy, we use tji to denote
the table for customer xji, nﬂk to denote the number of customers in
restaurant j at table t eating dish k, while mjk denotes the number of
tables in restaurant j serving dish k. Marginal counts are represented
with dots. So nﬂ. denotes the number of customers in restaurant j at
table t, and mu represents the total number of tables in the franchise.

Let x = (xﬁ : all j, i), xjt = (le- : all i with tji = t), t = (tji : all j, i), z =
(zji :allj,i),m=(mjk :allj,k) . When a superscript is used with a
set of variables, e.g. x‘ﬁ or njiﬂ, this means that the variable
corresponding to the index is removed from the set. In the example,
x—ﬁ =x/xﬁ and l is the number of observations in group j
associated with table t leaving out observation xﬁ.

An important quantity we will use often in sampling is the
conditional density of xji under mixture component k given all data
except xﬁ. This can be computed as

_Xﬁ ff(xjil¢ik)l_lj/i/¢ji,z

f ( ) .,./=kf(xj/i/1¢,k)h(¢ik)d¢ik
k xii =

’ ' (A12)
fl_Ij/i/ $17,411 =kf(xj/i/ up“, )h(¢ik )d¢ik

 

Here, we are marginalizing out the effects of the uncertainty in
the allele frequencies m. For our purposes, f (. IQ) is a multinomial
distribution and h,(.) is a symmetric Dirichlet distribution with
parameters A, on the simplex of dimension P if we observe
P different alleles at locus i. Therefore, the numerator and

CONCENTRATION PARAMETER UPDATES

For updating the concentration parameter do, we use the method
described by Teh et al. (2006), using a sampling scheme of auxiliary
variables. For N individuals, deﬁne auxiliary variables, w = (Wj)JN=1
and s = (sj)JN=1, where each Wj e [0, 1] and each sj is a binary variable
in {0, 1}. Then we have the following sampling scheme

q(a0|W,s) ~ Gamma a+mu+l—Zsj,b+l—Zlog(wj~)
j j

q(Wj|a0) ~ Beta(a0+1,nju)
q(sj|a0) ~ Binomial(l,nju/a0/(l+nju/a0))

To update do, we iterate these three steps until the value of a0
converges. Convergence is usually quick and takes about 20—30
iterations.

For updating y, we use the method described in Escobar and West
(1995), using an auxiliary variable )7. Assume y has a gamma prior
Gamma (a, b).

We have

610411.10 ~ ﬂnGamma(a+k.1/(b—10g(n)))
+(l — an)Gamma(a+K —l,1/(b — log (n)))
where the mixture weights are given by
71,] a +k — 1

1 —rr,] _ mu(b—log(n))

 

Secondly, we have
q(n|y.K)~Beta(J/+1.m..)

Alternating these updates until the value of y converges provides
a method for updating y.

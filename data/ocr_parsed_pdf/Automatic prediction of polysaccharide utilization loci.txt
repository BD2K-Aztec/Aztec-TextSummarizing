Abstract

Motivation: A bacterial polysaccharide utilization locus (PUL) is a set of physically linked genes
that orchestrate the breakdown of a specific glycan. PULs are prevalent in the Bacteroidetes phy—
lum and are key to the digestion of complex carbohydrates, notably by the human gut microbiota.
A given Bacteroidetes genome can encode dozens of different PULs whose boundaries and precise
gene content are difficult to predict.

Results: Here, we present a fully automated approach for PUL prediction using genomic context
and domain annotation alone. By combining the detection of a pair of marker genes with operon
prediction using intergenic distances, and queries to the carbohydrate—active enzymes database
(www.cazy.org), our predictor achieved above 86% accuracy in two Bacteroides species with exten—
sive experimental PUL characterization.

Availability and implementation: PUL predictions in 67 Bacteroidetes genomes from the human
gut microbiota and two additional species, from the canine oral sphere and from the environment,
are presented in our database accessible at www.cazy.org/PULDB/index.php.

1 Introduction

Glycans are exceptionally diverse molecules whose roles notably
include energy storage (starch in plants, glycogen in metazoans
and fungi), structure (cellulose, hemicelluloses and pectins of plant
cell walls, chitin of arthropod exoskeletons), cell communication
and host pathogen interactions. Simple monosaccharides can be
assembled via 06- and ﬁ—glycosidic bounds into macromolecules of
enormous diversity. It has been estimated that >1012 hexasacchar—
ides could be built using only D—hexoses (Laine, 1994). Even though
not all possible glycan structures exist in nature, the breakdown
of such complex molecules requires a plethora of carbohydrate ac—
tive enzymes (CAZymes), for which the CAZy database—available
at www.cazy.0rg—0ffers a continuously updated sequence—based

family classification (Lombard et (11., 2014). Organisms that feed on
complex glycans have thus evolved large CAZyme repertoires.

The human diet includes a large amount of carbohydrates,
ranging from simple disaccharides, such as sucrose and lactose, to
storage polysaccharides, typically glycogen and starch, and the
multitude of complex structures found in the cell walls of cereals,
fruits, vegetables and in the mammalian extracellular matrix.
However, the human genome only encodes digestive CAZymes that
break down sucrose, lactose and the readily digestible component of
starch (El Kaoutari et (11., 2013). All other carbohydrates, often
termed dietary fiber, enter the large bowel where a dense microbial
community comprising trillions of bacteria, the microbiota, breaks
down these structures, as well as host—derived (mucosal) glycans.

The monosaccharides generated are fermented by the microbiota to
generate short chain fatty acids, which can provide up to 10% of
our daily caloric needs (McNeil, 1984).

With the recent advances in DNA sequencing techniques, many
metagenomic studies have focused on the relationship between diet—
ary fiber and the microbiota, to gain insights into how the nutrition
of this microbial ecosystem influences the physiology of the human
host—see Flint et al. (2012) for a review. Despite species—level vari—
ability, it has been found that two bacterial phyla usually represent
the majority of the sequenced 16S rRNA derived from the human
gut microbiota: the Gram—positive Firmicutes and the Gram—nega—
tive Bacteroidetes (Ley et al., 2006).

As Gram—negative bacteria, Bacteroidetes species are character—
ized by a periplasmic space located between two lipid bilayer cellu—
lar membranes. This compartment enabled these bacteria to evolve
a specific strategy for carbohydrate breakdown, which are encoded
by physically linked and functionally related genes known as poly—
saccharide utilization loci (PULs). Each PUL encodes co—regulated
proteins that (i) bind to polysaccharides on the surface of the bacter—
ium, (ii) mediate limited cleavage of the targeted polysaccharides on
the outer membrane, (iii) import oligosaccharides generated on the
bacterial surface to the periplasm, (iv) catalyze the final saccharifica—
tion of the imported oligosaccharides to monosaccharides in the
periplasmic space and (v) sense degradation products to regulate
PUL expression. Through duplication and neofunctionalization,
Bacteroidetes have largely inherited and exchanged PULs via vertical
and horizontal transfer. As a consequence, extant Bacteroidetes spe—
cies now exhibit dozens of PULs that encode different enzyme con—
sortia that are tailored to degrade specific glycans. PUL diversity
may contribute to the evolutionary success of Bacteroidetes by pro—
viding a general glycan utilization strategy, optimized to catabolize
the extensive repertoire of complex carbohydrates presented to the
mammalian large bowel. The PUL system is not restricted to mam—
malian gut Bacteroidetes, as this phylum is also common in other
body sites, other animals as well as in the environment (McBride
et al., 2009).

The PUL paradigm was initially defined for the starch utilization
system (Sus) of the human gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomi—
cron. This PUL consists of eight genes, snsA-G and snsR, including
three genes that encode CAZymes. On the outer cell surface,
SusDEF bind components of starch, while ot—amylase SusG binds and
cleaves the polysaccharide to oligosaccharides, which are seques—
trated by SusC into the periplasmic space of the bacterium.
Imported oligosaccharides, which are sensed by SusR leading to
upregulation of the PUL, are depolymerized to glucose by neopulla—
nase SusA and ot—glucosidase SusB. The functional characterization
of each Sus PUL member has been performed independently
(Cameron et al., 2012; Kitamura et al., 2008; Koropatkin and
Smith, 2010; Koropatkin et al., 2008). More recently, Larsbrink
et al. (2014) characterized all eight CAZymes of a 12—gene PUL of
Bacteroides ovatns dedicated to xyloglucan degradation. Such com—
prehensive approaches are expected to become more widespread as
the understanding of PUL function requires the elucidation of the
synergistic interactions between all components of the glycan metab—
olizing apparatus orchestrated by these loci (Terrapon and
Henrissat, 2014). In this context, it is critical that all the proteins
encoded by specific PULs are identified and, when appropriate, are
correctly assigned to families in the CAZy database, which in turn
provides insights into the possible function of these CAZymes. An
ideal approach would be the exhaustive screening of gene expression
of a target species in response to a large variety of carbohydrate sub—
strates, as done by Martens et al. (2008) for B.t/7etaiotaomicron, by

Martens et al. (2011) for B.ovatns and by McNulty et al. (2013) for
Bacteroides cellulosilyticns. However, the large number of
Bacteroidetes species, the difficulty in accessing all the possible gly—
cans in a purified and highly defined form—impure glycans can give
highly misleading gene expression data (Martens et al., 2011), pre—
cludes the systematic identification of PULs based solely on gene ex—
pression. An alternative, and more tractable, strategy is the
development of an automatic prediction method to identify these
loci from genome sequence alone, thereby avoiding the need for bac—
terial cultivation and extensive gene expression studies.

Here, we present a bioinformatics approach for PUL prediction
in Bacteroidetes species. We evaluate the performance of our ap—
proach against experimentally characterized or predicted PULs,
available for two Bacteroidetes species of the human gut microbiota.
We have applied this predictor to 67 genomes of Bacteroidetes spe—
cies of the human gut to offer a perspective on the general character—
istics of PULs and to allow intergenome comparisons. These
predictions are made accessible through a web interface, which also
includes, for comparison purposes, two other Bacteroidetes: the en—
vironmental Flavobacterinm johnsoniae (McBride et al., 2009) and
the canine oral sphere bacterium Capnocytop/oaga canimorsns
(Manfredi et al., 201 1).

2 Methods

Our predictive strategy is based on the observed essential features of
PULs obtained through experimental analysis of these loci in
B.t/7etaiotaomicron VPI—5482 and B.ovatns ATCC 8483, referred to
as reference PULs hereafter (Section 2.1). Our PUL prediction pro—
gram was used to interrogate 67 Bacteroidetes genomes downloaded
from the IMG/M—HMP resource (Section 2.2). The strategy relies on
the identification in each genome of the PUL markers: the presence
of adjacent genes encoding SusC—like and SusD—like proteins,
referred to as tandem snsCD-like pairs (Section 2.3). Indeed, a PUL
looks like an operon structured around tandem snsCD-like pairs,
while the members of these loci (encoding regulators, binding pro—
teins and enzymes that cleave glycans), vary from one locus to an—
other. Hence, we initiated PUL prediction by a strategy similar to
operon prediction, delineating PULs around the tandem snsCD-like
pairs based on intergenic distances only (Section 2.4). Reference
PULs frequently contain genes encoding CAZymes (cazymes),
which, although functionally related, may be separated by large
intergenic regions to allow finer regulation or by gene of unknown
function. Hence, our predictor extends PUL boundaries to adjacent
operons based on the presence of a cazyme using a sliding window
(Section 2.5). Additional indicators of conserved adjacency (micro—
synteny) have been tested (Section 2.6). PULs often start/end with
a regulatory gene either on the opposite DNA strand or separated
by a large intergenic distance from the other members of the locus.
As a consequence, we developed a specific method for the inclu—
sion of regulators (Section 2.7). We also observed in B.ovatns, the
presence of short gene models, encoding proteins shorter than
60 amino acids, which interfered with the PUL prediction. These
short gene models were thus ignored (Section 2.8). Finally, to re—
fine the delineation of PULs with multiple tandem snsCD-like
pairs, we implemented rules for the fusion and division of adjacent
PULs (see Section 2.9). Our prediction strategy was designed by
selecting the best criteria and their combination after evaluation of
the results against the reference PULs of B.t/7etaiotaomicron
and B.ovatns using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves
(Section 2.10).

2.1 Reference PULs

Current knowledge of the characteristic features of PULs mainly
arises from work published by Martens et al. (2008, 2011) for two
species. These studies enabled PUL prediction based on: (i) coordi—
nated gene expression using transcriptomics, (ii) gene inactivation
and biochemical characterization and (iii) manual inspection of the
genomic context. These reference P ULs have been used in the design
and evaluation of our prediction strategy. However, many of the ref—
erence PULs are still putative and thus not necessarily precisely
delineated since the target substrate has not been established.
Within the literature, discrepancies also appear between the tabu—
lated and pictorial presentation of some B.tloetaiotaomicron refer—
ence PULs (Martens et al., 2008), as well as between ‘homologous
PULs’ defined between B.tloetaiotaomicron and B.ovatns (Martens
et al., 2011). We opted to use the tabular presentation of reference
PULs in these two species.

2.2 Bacteroidetes genomic data

Genomic data were downloaded from the Integrated Microbial
Genome and Metagenomes/Human Microbiome Project [IMG/
M—HMP (Markowitz et al., 2012)] resource in March 2013. For all
the 67 Bacteroidetes species with completed genome sequences and
tagged as originating from the gastrointestinal tract, three types of
data were used: (i) information about gene position, orientation and
intergenic distance (GFF file), (ii) predicted amino acid sequence
(fasta file) and (iii) protein domain annotation using the Pfam v27
resource (Finn et al., 2014). The cazymes were identified and
assigned to sequence—based families using the same procedures
deployed to update the CAZy database (Lombard et al., 2014).
Supplementary Table S3 presents the CAZy annotation for those
57 genomes (not released in the NCBI database) that are not present
in the CAZy website.

2.3 Signature of PULs: the susC— and suleike genes

The identification of snsC—like and snsD—like genes was based on
Pfam domain assignment. SusC—like proteins are TonB—dependent
transporters characterized by a specific linear sequence of domains:
PF13715 (unknown function), PF07715 (TonB—dependent receptor’s
plug) and PF005 93 (TonB—dependent receptor), as illustrated in
Figure 1. We also captured possible variations of this combination
that include: (i) the addition of an N—terminal domain PF07660 that
interacts with ECF—a/anti—a regulators (cf Section 2.7) in trans—enve—
lope signaling (Koebnik, 2005; Martens et al., 2009), (ii) the split
of the snsC—like gene model into two genes and (iii) the apparent
lack of PF00593 domain that scored slightly worse than the Pfam

recommended threshold. Encoded SusD—like proteins were charac—
terized by either a single or a pair of domains among four related
domains in Pfam: PF07980, PF12741, PF12771, PF14322 (SusD
and SusD—like domains), as illustrated in Figure 1.

For our predictions, we defined tandem snsCD-like pairs in a
genome based on the presence of adjacent snsC—like (upstream) and
snsD—like (downstream) genes, located on the same DNA strand.
Because specific tandem SusCD—like pairs can be occasionally ex—
tended by adjacent copies of either snsC— (upstream) or susD—like
genes (downstream), such duplications were incorporated.

2.4 Operon prediction using intergenic distances
Automatic operon prediction has been intensively studied in the
model bacteria Escherichia coli and Bacillus snbtilis (Bockhorst
et al., 2003; Moreno—Hagelsieb and Collado—Vides, 2002; Salgado
et al., 2000). The classical indicators of operon membership include:
(i) intergenic distances, (ii) synteny across different genomes, (iii) the
occurrence of gene pairs fused into single genes in other genomes,
(iv) similarity of functional annotation and (v) gene co—expression.
However, operon prediction based on genomic information only is
highly desirable as transcriptomics data are not always available.
Moreover, functional annotation is often unreliable, and a se—
quence—based method would also allow predictions to be made for
non—cultivated sequenced species. In this context, Westover et al.,
(2005) confirmed in E.coli and B.tloetaiotaomicron that the inter—
genic distance in directons—a term that refers to operons made of
consecutive genes on the same strand without interruption by any
gene on the opposite strand—is the most powerful feature for op—
eron prediction. As PULs are not exactly operons, we tested both
intergenic distances with or without restriction to directons, as well
as operon memberships from publicly available resources: the publi—
cation of Westover et al. (2005) and two general databases: DOOR
(Mao et al., 2009) and ProOpDB (Taboada et al., 2012). Each
approach produced a list of contiguous gene pairs. PUL prediction
started from each tandem snsCD-like pair and iteratively extended
PUL boundaries to adjacent genes when the pairs belonged to the
list of contiguous pairs.

2.5 CAZy annotation

The CAZy database (www.cazy.org) has offered for more than
15 years an online and continuously updated classification of pro—
teins based on sequence similarity to functionally characterized
CAZymes (Lombard et al., 2014). CAZy annotation consists of
assigning module/domain families and subfamilies for six major
CAZyme categories: glycoside hydrolases (GHs) and polysaccharide

lyases (PLs) that cleave glycans, glycosyltransferases that synthesize
glycans, non—catalytic carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs),
carbohydrate esterases (CEs) and auxiliary activities. Our PUL pre—
dictor only makes use of GHs, PLs, CBMs and CEs that are directly
connected to glycan degradation. In our PUL predictor, CAZy anno—
tations were used to extend PUL boundaries beyond intergenic—
distance predictions. The principle was to search for a CAZy
annotation among the genes that directly follow the PUL boundary,
from the first to the fifth gene located after the boundary. If a
CAZyme gene was found, the PUL boundary was extended to this
gene. Iteratively, PUL predictions restarted from this gene until no
further PUL member could be identified.

2.6 Domain adjacency information

Conservation of adjacent genes across genomes (Dandekar et al.,
1998; Ermolaeva et al., 2001), and the existence of a gene pair as a
fused gene in another genome (Enright et al., 1999; Marcotte et al.,
1999), can provide strong evidence for an operonic structure. Such
features can be captured using protein domains—the structural,
functional and evolutionary sub—units of proteins (Apic et al., 2001;
Hegyi and Gerstein, 2001). Hence, we computed two lists of condi—
tionally dependent pairs [CDP (Terrapon et al., 2009)] of Pfam do—
mains to detect gene split and synteny, using the 67 Bacteroidetes
genomes from the human gut. For gene split, we considered all pairs
formed by the domains of each protein. For gene synteny, we con—
sidered all domain pairs formed by adjacent genes. CDP lists were
obtained by retaining only statistically significant pairs (Fisher’s
one—tailed exact test; P—value thresholds adjusted through ROC
curve comparisons). PUL boundaries were iteratively extended to
the neighboring genes if a pair, formed by domains encoded by the
PUL boundary gene and this following gene, was found in the
CDP list.

2.7 Terminal regulators

Inspection of the reference PULs and initial prediction attempts re—
vealed that PUL regulatory/sensory genes are difficult to identify
and required special processing. First, regulators are frequently
located on the opposite DNA strand or/and separated by a much
larger intergenic distance than the other genes in the locus.
Moreover, the diversity of described regulator families, their poor
domain characterization and their involvement in other processes
than carbohydrate metabolism are important limitations to their sys—
tematic identification. We first focused on well—characterized hybrid
two—component systems (HTCS) and the extra—cytoplasmic func—
tioning (ECF) family of a/anti—a factors. Although other regulatory
families exist such as SusR, AraC, GntR, SARP/OmpR, LacI and
CRP, the majority of PUL regulators only involve HTCS and ECF
families: 28 HTCS and 22 ECF in B.tloetaiotaomicron, 39 HTCS
and 35 ECF in B.ovatns, while only 12 PULs in B.tloetaiotaomicron
and 8 PULs in B.ovatns are linked to another regulator family. The
identification of HTCS and ECF regulators rely on Pfam domain
composition: PF04542—PF08281 (ECF—a), PF04773 (Anti—a) and
PF07494—PF07495—PF005 12—PF0251 8—PF00072—PF12833 (HTCS;
with frequent variations at the N—terminus). We additionally
included three minor families of regulators: (i) GntR, characterized
by Pfam domain PF00392, (ii) AraC, based on a combination
of Pfam domains PF12833 with either PF02311 or PF13377 and
(iii) SusR, the prototypic PUL regulator, for which no Pfam model is
currently available and we thus created our own. For the design
of our prediction strategy, regulator detection was tested up to
three genes after the last PUL member. Finally, as we observed in

reference PULs that regulators usually mark the end of the locus,
except for HTCS, we interrupted our iterative extension of PUL
boundaries after regulatory gene detection, except for HTCS regu—
lons for which the prediction iteration was allowed to restart if a
cazyme was encountered after the HTCS gene.

2.8 Filtering short gene models

During initial prediction attempts for B.ovatns, we observed that
some mismatches between predicted and reference PULs were
caused by short gene models that interfered with the prediction.
These short gene models were absent in B.tloetaiotaomicron.
Whatever the origin of these genes (assembly problems or real frag—
ments), we introduced an additional criterion into the predictor:
genes shorter than 180 bp were not considered. This procedure
clearly improved prediction for B.ovatns, and did not affect
B .tloetaiotaomicron’s results (data not shown).

2.9 Fusion and division of adjacent PULs

Examination of the reference PULs revealed that they are frequently
composed of several adjacent operons that are not necessarily on the
same DNA strand. Thus, we observed reference PULs with several
tandem snsCD pairs, which appear like the fusion of adjacent PULs.
However, there are also many demonstrated examples of adjacent
PULs that have been differentiated due to differential substrate
responses. Such examples include the heparin utilization region of
B .tloetaiotaomicron, which is split by an insertion of a beta—galactan
PUL (Martens et al., 2008) and the xyloglucan utilization locus of
B .ovatns which sits immediately upstream of another PUL that does
not show differential expression in the presence of xyloglucan
(Larsbrink et al., 2014; Martens et al., 2011). These adjacent, but
distinct, PULs are frequently merged together by our prediction
strategy which works as a sliding window for the incorporation of
cazymes. To more accurately delineate such a complex arrangement
of PULs, our strategy first assembles contiguous sets of genes into
single large entities (prospective PULs). These sets of genes are
assembled in three cases: (i) when constitutive cazymes are separated
by two or less unknown genes, (ii) when two prospective PULs are
directly adjacent and (iii) when an integrase gene (Pfam domain
PF00589) is found between two such prospective PULs, follow—
ing the example of the mucin O—glycan reference PUL 14 of
B.tloetaiotaomicron (Martens et al., 2008). We then attempt to div—
ide the large assembled entities that exhibit more than one tandem
snsCD pair only when a regulatory gene other than HTCS is found
(keeping the regulator in the closest tandem snsCD pair) or when
two directons (without any interrupting genes) are running in oppos—
ite directions on opposite strands.

2.10 Evaluation of PUL predictions

The different prediction criteria described in the earlier sections
were evaluated against the reference PULs of B.tloetaiotaomicron
and B.ovatns (see Section 2.1) to define our overall prediction
strategy. Reference PULs are sometimes interrupted by one or
more genes that are not components of the PUL (hereafter called
‘non—PUL genes’) based on their lack of coregulation with the other
members of the PUL. This results in non—contiguous gene pairs for
which we had to create a novel evaluation approach that extends
the classical operon evaluation model. Our evaluation scheme, illus—
trated in Supplementary Figure S1, divides all adjacent gene pairs
in three categories: (i) positive pairs corresponding to adjacent genes
inside the reference PULs (768 and 1027 in B.tloetaiotaomicron
and B.ovatns, respectively), (ii) half positive/half negative pairs

where a PUL gene involved in a non—contiguous pair in the reference
PULs is linked to its adjacent non—PUL gene (20 and 10 in
B.tloetaiotaomicron and B.ovatns, respectively) and (iii) negative
pairs that include all the remaining pairs not components of the ref—
erence PULs (4026 and 4447 in B.tloetaiotaomicron and B.ovatns,
respectively). This evaluation scheme avoided the exclusion of non—
contiguous PUL genes or the inclusion of intercalated non—PUL
genes.

To assess the quality of the PUL predictions, we listed the pre—
dicted adjacent gene pairs of PUL genes for each possible intergenic
distance. We then computed for each distance value: (i) the true
positive rate (TPR), the ratio of correctly predicted pairs over the
total number of positive pairs and (ii) the false positive rate (FPR),
the ratio of wrongly predicted pairs over the total number of nega—
tive pairs. Finally, we plotted ROC curves that showed the evolution
of TPR and FPR when varying the intergenic distance thresholds
and used these to compare the different PUL prediction strategies
(see Figs 2 and 3; Supplementary Figs S1—S3).

3 Results and discussion

3.1 PUL prediction strategy

The objective of this work was to design a fully automated PUL pre—
dictor, based on genomic context only, that draws on reference
PULs defined using a combination of experimental data and analysis
(Martens et al., 2008, 2011). In this section, we (Apic et al., 2001)
show the evaluation of the distinct predictive features and compare
their predictive power using ROC curves.

3.1.1 Intergenic distance in directons
We first examined the predicted PULs around tandem snsCD-like
pairs using intergenic distances alone (with or without restriction to

directons), and compared the results to the operonic pairs described
for B.tloetaiotaomicron in DOOR, ProOpDB and by Westover et al.
(2005) (Fig. 2). We observed that the method able to retrieve the
largest number of PUL genes is the intergenic distance without direc—
tion restriction, but only at the expense of numerous false predic—
tions. The DOOR and ProOpDB databases identify only a very
limited number of PULs, most likely due to the lack of calibration
against data from the particular Bacteroidetes phylum. The solution
providing the best tradeoff is the intergenic distance restricted to
directons, alone or in combination with other indicators [functional
annotation and conserved synteny in predictions from Westover
et al. (2005 )]. Hence, we used the distances in directons only in our
PUL prediction model, as it obtain similar results and will be less
subject to variation across genome projects (annotation of various
function—import, binding, cleavage, signaling—and assembly com—
pleteness) than Westover’s predictions.

3.1.2 Addition of CAZymes

We next integrated the information about cazymes into the PUL pre—
dictor based on intergenic distances in directons. The PUL bounda—
ries were extended when a cazyme was adjacent (CAZy1), second
(CAZy2), third (CAZy3), etc., relative to the current PUL boundary.
The results of ROC analysis for B.tloetaiotaomicron and B.ovatns
(Fig. 3) show that the inclusion of CAZy annotation significantly
enhanced the predictive power of our approach. On one hand,
CAZy1 provided the safest predictions (highest TPRs for similar
FPRs), whereas CAZy2 achieved higher TPRs than CAZy1, but at
the expense of a few false positive predictions. The same was true
for CAZy3 compared to CAZy2, but CAZy4 and CAZy5 did not
further improve the predictions. As CAZymes are central to under—
stand PUL synergy and to identify target substrates, the largest set of
predictions is desirable. We therefore decided to provide the user
with several confidence levels, from the predictions with the lowest
FPRs (CAZy1), to predictions containing more true positives, but
also some false positives (CAZy3). Such distinctions are displayed in
our web interface (Section 3.2).

3.1.3 Domain adjacency

The integration of indicators of gene split and synteny had a limited
impact (Supplementary Figs S1 and S2). We observed that only the
gene directly adjacent to the last PUL member should be considered.
While the detection of gene split was generally positive, we removed
the indicators of gene synteny from our predictor as this parameter
brought similar numbers of true and false positives.

3.1.4 Final predictions

After the integration of the families of regulators (best performance
was obtained for detection up to the second gene after the last
PUL member—data not shown), the elimination of short gene
models and the fusion and division of PULs, our final predictions
suggest that the best trade—off between TPRs and FPRs correspond
to an intergenic distance 3102 bp (highlighted by a circle in
Supplementary Fig. S3). The predicted PUL members represent 87
and 91% of the reference PULs in B.tloetaiotaomicron and B .ovatns,
respectively, while extra—predictions (false positives) represent <8%
of the ‘true’ members (more details in Section 2 and Supplementary
Table S4). The PUL division (Section 2.9) notably allowed to reduce
the number of predicted PULs with multiple tandem SnsCD-like
pairs from 19 and 22 in B.tloetaiotaomicron and B.ovatns to
13 and 15, respectively, for 10 and 14 experimentally validated
PULs. The adjacent PUL delineation, as well as the recognition of

non—contiguous gene pairs are current limitations of our approach.
Such cases, as the xyloglucan PUL in B.ovatns described by
Larsbrink et al. (2014) or the heparin and beta—galactan PUL in
B.tloetaiotaomicron validated in Martens et al. (2008) (see Section
2.9), are currently resolvable only by experimental characterization.
A possible solution for such difficult cases would be the integration
of comparative genomics information, starting from experimentally
validated PULs. However, at this stage and following the practice in
biocuration, we prefer to report the actual boundaries only when we
find published evidence for the studied strain, with no extrapolation
to other genomes. In the future, based on examination of a larger
amount of expression data, we might revise this conservative policy
and investigate whether boundaries can be safely extended from one
strain to other strains or other bacteria.

3.2 Web interface
We used our predictor to analyze 67 genomes of Bacteroidetes from
the human gut microbiota (see Supplementary Fig. S4 for the distri—
bution at the taxonomic level). We additionally included PUL pre—
dictions for two other Bacteroidetes species for which a list of all
putative PULs have previously been published: the environmental
gliding bacterium Ejolonsoniae (McBride et al., 2009) and
C.canimorsns, isolated from the oral canine cavity and responsible
for severe human septicemia (Manfredi et al., 2011). A web inter—
face was implemented to allow browsing of the database of pre—
dicted PULs (PULDB) in these 69 genomes at www.cazy.org/
PULDB/index.php.

This interface first provides the user with the list of all PULs for
a given species, or taxonomic group. The result page (Fig. 4;
Supplementary Fig. S5) displays PULs as trains whose wagons are
the genes colored according to the function of the encoded proteins
for SusC—like and SusD—like, CAZyme modules and regulators
HTCS and ECF—a /anti—a factors; the remaining proteins are con—
sidered as having unknown function (in gray). To facilitate the visu—
alization and comparison of PULs, we allow the reversal of PUL
orientation and the reordering of the table to bring similar PULs

closer. Furthermore, we implemented the search for specific
PULs based on CAZy families, with the possibility of indicating the
sequential order of the constituent families. For example, searching
for PULs encoding ordered CAZy families GH3, GH2, GH31 and
GH5 for the breakdown of xyloglucan, as described by Larsbrink
et al. (2014), allows the retrieval of the corresponding PULs in eight
other species with a high level of micro—synteny (see Fig. 4).

Moreover, to allow inspection of the genomic context of a PUL,
we integrated a JBrowse engine (Skinner et al., 2009), illustrated by
Supplementary Figure S6. The user can visualize the predicted PUL
with confidence levels (CAZy1 to CAZy3 colored from green to red)
as well as published PULs. A contextual menu associated to the
genes and PULs allows the user to open new pages with detailed in—
formation about (i) the encoded proteins (following IMG/M—HMP
annotation or Pfam domains), (ii) the function of CAZymes if
known (EC numbers) and (iii) the experimentally verified substrates.
Finally, the JBrowse engine also allow loading the user’s own
expression data, such as short—reads from BAM files.

3.3 PUL characteristics

3.3.1 General features of predicted PULs in 67 genomes

The PUL predictions for the 67 Bacteroidetes species from the
human gastrointestinal tract offer a large—scale perspective of the
characteristics of these loci and allow the derivation of some gen—
eral statistics about PUL composition. A total of 3745 PULs were
predicted in the 67 Bacteroidetes genomes of the human gut micro—
biota. For each species, Supplementary Table S5 presents the global
PUL content (number of genes, tandem snsCD-like pairs and
cazymes) and the specific features of these loci (presence/absence
of cazymes, number of cazymes per PUL, regulators).

In predicted PULs, as in reference PULs, we observed a certain
number of loci with no GH— or PL—encoding gene. A possible ex—
planation could be that these putative PULs encode GHs or PLs that
are yet unknown and therefore not present in the CAZy database.
Other explanations include the possibility that these PULs represent
either non—functional gene cassettes, or functional elements that

would assist other loci, for example, in the surveillance of available
substrate. Another possibility is that SusCD—encoding operons could
fulfill functions other than the utilization of carbohydrate polymers.
Interestingly, the number of PULs without GH or PLs is smaller and
more similar across species than the number of PULs encoding these
enzymes (Supplementary Fig. S7). This suggests that PULs encoding
GHs or PLs could fulfill conserved generic functions, while the
acquisition of PULs with such enzymes may reflect adaptation to the
specific environment of the bacterium.

In the 67 genomes, the number of GH and PL genes found out—
side of PULs is fairly constant (~60 per genome; Fig. 5) and prob—
ably includes many house—keeping functions. Deviations mainly
involve highly fragmented genomes (>200 scaffolds; highlighted in
Fig. 5) for which PUL predictions end at scaffold borders. Here, GH
and PL genes separated from tandem susCD-like pairs by a scaffold
break necessarily escape integration in a PUL and artificially in—
crease the number of such genes apparently outside of PULs.
Interestingly, the number of GH and PL genes predicted in PULs is
extremely variable across species (Fig. 5), with the average number

per PUL ranging from 2.5 to 4 (Supplementary Fig. S8). This sug—
gests that evolution does not simply promote loci encoding GHs
and PLs per se, but imposes a selection pressure that favors the
accumulation of genes encoding enzymes that act in synergy to
deconstruct complex polysaccharides.

Odoribacter splanclonicns is characterized by an unconventional
profile, with the highest number of PULs without CAZymes (60 of
64), and the highest proportion of PULs associated to regulators.
Furthermore, O.splanclonicns displays a particular set of PUL regula—
tors including 41 loci regulated by ECF—a/anti—a and none by HTCS.
In comparison, to date, most other Bacteroidetes have more compar—
able numbers of these two regulator types (Supplementary Fig. S9).

3.3.2 Limits of the tandem susCD pair paradigm?

We have used tandem susCD-like pairs as the signature of PULs as
these adjacent genes were found in all these loci. Ninety—nine of the
101 tandem susCD-like pairs identified in B.tloetaiotaomicron be—
long to reference PULs, and 126 of 127 in B.ovatns. The only excep—
tions correspond to the BT2259—BT2260 and BT2263—BT2264 pairs
in B.tloetaiotaomicron and the BACOVA_00058—BACOVA_00059
pair in B .ovatns. Despite being adjacent and encoding characteristic
Pfam domains of SusC— and SusD—like proteins, these loci were not
listed in reference PULs by Martens et al. (2008, 2011 ).

We next tested the hypothesis that all PULs require a tandem
susCD-like pair. In B.tloetaiotaomicron, 86 of the 88 reference PULs
(109 of 112 in B.ovatns) contain at least one tandem susCD-like
pair. The exceptions are PUL27 and PUL63 in B.tloetaiotaomicron,
PUL66, PUL74 and PUL94 in B.ovatns, in which no snsD—like gene
is detected in the vicinity of a snsC—like gene. In three of these five
cases, the adjacent gene to the snsC—like is annotated in reference
(Martens et al., 2008) as ‘snsD—like’, but the encoded product shows
no detectable sequence similarity to other SusD—like proteins or their
characteristic Pfam domains. It is possible that these genes fulfill
a role similar to SusD homologs in spite of the lack of sequence
relatedness. Hereafter, we utilize the term susD—like only when
sequence similarity is demonstrable. Another explanation could be
that the SusC—like protein alone is sufficient for glycan transport.
Indeed, in each Bacteroidetes species, we observed the existence
of ~10—20 snsC—like genes, without an adjacent snsD—like gene.
SusC—like transporters SusC—like are found in many other bacterial
phyla, including Gram—positive Firmicutes or Proteobacteria, and tar—
get various substrates distinct from glycans (Schauer et al., 2008).
This argues against the prediction of PULs based on the presence of
only a snsC—like gene. On the contrary, almost all susD—like genes are
adjacent to a susC—like partner, except rare cases such as BT4085 in
B.tloetaiotaomicron, although the cognate gene is still a component
of a PUL. This suggests that snsD—like genes alone could be used as a
basis for PUL prediction. In—depth examination of the susD genes in
the 67 Bacteroidetes, revealed several additional snsD—like genes
without adjacent snsC—like genes, which either correspond to: (i)
snsD—like gene at the scaffold border, likely reﬂecting poorly
assembled genomes (two species accounting for 15 of 41 encountered
cases), (ii) missing a snsC—like gene model upstream of the susD—like
gene despite detectable Pfam domains of snsC—like genes (three spe—
cies accounts for 32 cases of 41), (iii) split of the tandem SusCD pair
by one intercalated gene, (iv) translocated snsD, 2—3 genes upstream
of the snsC—like gene (12 cases highly conserved across species with
the following organization: snsD—gene1—gene2—snsC—snsD-snsC), (v)
duplicated snsD—like gene close to a tandem SusCD—like pair and (vi)
no snsC—like sequence in the vicinity of the snsD—like gene. All these
cases currently lack biological characterization and represent only

3% of the 4141 standard tandem susCD-like pairs in the 67
Bacteroidetes genomes. If these loci respond to polysaccharides, it
would be interesting to verify if they are expressed alone or if they
are part of a co—regulated network (Ravcheev et al., 2013). These
cases will require careful analyses to elucidate their biological rele—
vance, which may in turn allow the refinement of the PUL paradigm.

4 Conclusion

By combining observed PUL structures derived from experimental
investigations of two Bacteroidetes species, we were able to develop
a tool for the automatic prediction of PULs solely based on genome
sequence. The percentage of correctly predicted PULs was 87% in
B.thetaiotaomicron and 91% in B.ovatus, with only a few false pre—
dictions that represent <8% of the true positives. We applied our
approach to compute 3745 PUL predictions for 67 Bacteroidetes
species from the human gut microbiota. Varying numbers of PULs
(from 1 to 1 17) were observed in the different species, with a major—
ity of PULs containing at least two GH—encoding genes, and around
equal proportions of the two considered regulator types. The results
are accessible to the scientific community via the interactive web—
interface PULDB at www.cazy.org/PULDB/index.php.

Because our method is based solely on genomic information, the
accuracy of the PUL delineation depends on the quality of the gen—
ome assemblies and gene predictions. With appropriately assembled
genomes, our method can provide high—throughput prediction
of classical PULs in species without expression data, or in non—
cultivated species subject to single cell sequencing. We expect that
experimental studies will benefit from these predicted PULs for the
investigation of the targeted substrates, and the evolutionary ana—
lysis of glycan breakdown in a wide range of species. Iteratively, our
automatic PUL—prediction strategy will be refined by integrating
additional knowledge of the PUL paradigm. In addition, a human
curation step by the CAZy team is planned to correct any erroneous
predictions that would appear following the experimental character—
ization of a PUL. Finally, future developments will also include
Bacteroidetes from environmental species to explore the genetic
architecture and function of the PULs in these organisms.

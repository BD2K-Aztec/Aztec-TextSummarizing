It has been argued recently that linkage peaks detected by
family—based methods can potentially be caused by rare variants
(Bowden, 2011), and that using family data can avoid heterogen—
eity and be more fruitful for detecting such rare variant associ—
ation (De et al., 2013). Further, family—based design should
provide an increase in power compared with population—based
designs for rare variants, as such variants are enriched in a family
if it does exist (Zhu et al., 2010). Most importantly, family—based
design will not be affected by population stratiﬁcation, whereas
case—control design may see an increase in type I error rate if left
unadjusted.

The stage is therefore set for detecting associated rare (and
common) haplotypes using family data. Commonly used
family—based methods for detecting common haplotypes such
as FBAT (Laird and Lange, 2006) may suffer from loss of
power if used for detection of rare haplotypes, because the esti—
mated variance of rare haplotype effects could be large. Recent
extension of FBAT does provide a way to analyze rSNVs by
collapsing and optionally weighting each variant (De et al.,
2013), but the method is not amenable to haplotypes. In this
article, we propose a family—based method aiming to detect
both rare and common haplotype associations using common
SNP data on case—parent trios. Our retrospective likelihood
correctly reﬂects the ascertainment procedure, and its factoriza—
tion resembles a ‘match—pair’ design as we will see in Section 2.
To shrink the coefﬁcients of unassociated haplotypes so that the
effects of rare associated haplotypes can be more precisely
estimated to increase the statistical power of detection, we
adopted the Logistic Bayesian Lasso (LBL) methodology for
parameter estimation and statistical inference (Biswas and Lin,
2012), leading to the famLBL algorithm. The proposed famLBL
method is thoroughly investigated to gauge its power and type I
error rate. We also compare famLBL with LBL and FBAT in
terms of robustness to population stratification and effectiveness
in detecting rare haplotype association. Finally, we apply
famLBL to the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) data to
illustrate its utility.

2 METHODS
Likelihood, logit and haplotype distribution modeling

Suppose we have n case-parent triads for which the families are
ascertained due to the child being affected with a particular disease. Let
Z,»=(Z,»), Zim, Zn.) denote the familial haplotype conﬁguration of triad i
(i.e. father, mother and child haplotype pairs, in that order), which is
typically unobservable, as phase information is usually not deductible
from genotype data G,» = (Gi), Gim, Gig). We assume the SNPs are located
close to one another so that there is no recombinant haplotype in the
child. Thus, we may write Z,» equivalently as Z,» = (Ziu, ZR), where Z,“ is
the haplotype pair that was not passed to the child. Note that parental
ordering is not necessary if allelic exchangeability is assumed, a weaker
condition than Hardy7Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) (Yang and Lin,
2013). Let D,- denote the event that family i is ascertained; for
case-parent triad design, this is equivalent to the event that the child is
affected, i.e. Y,-(. = 1. The complete data likelihood for a collection of n
triads is then

L(¢)=1‘[P(zi.| n: 1, ¢)P(Z.»u | 11>), (1)
i: 1

where ¢=(ﬁ,8) denotes the collection of individual haplotype effects
()3, regression coefﬁcients) and parameters associated with haplotype
frequencies (8), which will be speciﬁed more explicitly as our formulation
unfolds. Note the similarity between this likelihood and that based on
case-control data (Biswas and Lin, 2012); thus, this may be interpreted
as a ‘matched-pair’ design, although the pseudo individual with the
Z,“ haplotype pair comes from the target, not the control, population.
We use logistic regression to model the odds of disease for a given
haplotype Z: 62 =P(Y=l |Z)/P(Y=0 | Z). Speciﬁcally,

log Qz=a+XZ/B,

where X Z is a row vector associated with haplotype Z, at is the intercept
and ﬂ is a vector of coefﬁcients representing the haplotype effects. Note
that X Z can code for dominant/recessive/additive effects, which can be
speciﬁed by the investigator (Guo and Lin, 2009).

Let f=(f1, . . . ,fm) denote the frequencies of a total of m haplotypes
with the constraints that fk>0 and  1 fk =1. For a haplotype pair
Z = Zk/Z/‘J, we model its frequency in the target population by

: sz-l-dka—fk) ifzk=zk/
mum/1», ifwzr'

where d e (—1, 1) is the within-population inbreeding coefﬁcient that can
be used to capture excess/reduction of homozygosity (Weir, 1996). By
modeling the frequency in this way, we do not need to make the assump-
tion of HWE. Assuming that the haplotype pair distribution in the
control population is the same as in the target population, we can express
the distribution in the diseased population as

612(5)

9
bl = P(Z.».| n.'=1,¢)= A.
2 91-16111

H

The complete data likelihood in (1) can now be rewritten more fully as:
" exp {X2- 13}
L(¢) = az;,,(5)az,-.(5) - 
 Zexp means» (2)
H

which, we note, does not contain the regression parameter at, as it is
canceled out.

Speciﬁcation of priors

To shrink the coefﬁcients of the unassociated haplotypes toward zero so
that the effects of the associated ones can be estimated more precisely to
increase statistical power, we cast the problem into the Bayesian Lasso
framework (Park and Casella, 2008). As such, we need to assign prior
distributions to the parameters ¢= (ﬂ, 8 = {ﬂ oh). For each [3/ in )3, we use
the Laplace distribution, leading to the following density function:

A .
n(ﬁj|A)=§exp(—A|ﬁj|), —oo<ﬁj<oo, j=l,...,m—l,

where the variance is 2 /A2, and the hyperparameter A controls the level of
shrinkage. Instead of picking a ﬁxed value of A, we let it follow
Gamma(a, b) with pdf 710): ﬂA“’1exp(—Ab). This speciﬁcation of the
priors has been shown to givewthe Bayesian version of LASSO when
normal likelihood is used (Park and Casella, 2008) and has led to satis-
factory shrinkage in LBL (Biswas and Lin, 2012). The hyperparameters a
and b are selected to realistically reﬂect the odds ratio (OR) of associated
haplotypes for complex diseases; the range of [15, 25] will be explored
following Biswas and Lin (2012).

The parameters for modeling haplotype-pair frequencies, f and d, are
not independent. Because (12(8) must be non-negative, it poses the fol-
lowing constraint: d > max {—fk/(l —ﬁ.), k: 1, . . . , m — 1}. Therefore,
we let f follow Dirichlet(l,l,. . .,1). Then, we use the Uniform
(max fgﬂ—ﬁ/(l —ﬁ.)}, 1) distribution to model d givenf

FamLBL

 

Statistical inference based on posterior distributions
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are used to draw samples
of the parameters from the posterior distributions. We use the
MetropolisiHastings algorithm to update the )3 parameters with a
double exponential proposal distribution whose mean is the current
estimate and whose variance is proportional to the absolute value of
the current estimate to facilitate shrinkage. The MetropolisiHastings
algorithm is also used to update the inbreeding parameter d using a
uniform proposal distribution observing the constraints as described in
the above Subsection. For the rest of the parameters (i.e. A, Z and ﬂ, we
update them using the Gibbs sampler, as the posterior distributions are of
conjugate forms and can be sampled conveniently. Based on the MCMC
samples after convergence has been achieved, we draw inference regard-
ing association by testing for the signiﬁcance of each )3 coefﬁcient.
Speciﬁcally, we carry out a hypothesis test of H0 : lﬁl 5 6
versus H“ : lﬁl >6, where a is set to a small number, using Bayes
Factor (BF) (Raftery and Lewis, 1995), the ratio of posterior odds to
prior odds. If the BF exceeds a certain threshold, we conclude that the
corresponding )3 is signiﬁcant, i.e. the haplotype is associated with the
disease. Based on the work of Biswas and Lin (2012) after extensive
simulation, setting a = 0.1 and the BF threshold of 2 appear to be satis-
factory and leads to a type I error rate at or below 5%, so these tuning
parameters are adopted in the current study for most of the analyses. The
R package (with dynamic loading of C program) implementing this
method, famLBL, is publicly available.

3 RESULTS

We carried out extensive simulation to thoroughly evaluate the
performance of famLBL and compared it with LBL and FBAT.
A total of three sets of simulation are considered to evaluate
power, type I error, sensitivity to population substructure and
comparisons with LBL and FBAT. We describe the three
simulation settings, data generation process and results in the
following. In the last Subsection, we present an application of
famLBL to the FHS data.

3.1 Simulation settings and data generation

3.1.] Simulation 1 The setting for the ﬁrst simulation study
portraits data from a homogeneous population. This setting is
used to demonstrate that famLBL, utilizing triad family data,
controls type I error adequately, and to compare its power
with that of LBL based on case—control data. Three haplotype
distributions, HSl, HS2 and HS3, consisting of 6, 9 or 12 haplo—
types, respectively, are considered. For each distribution, three
scenarios are considered: only a common haplotype (fre—
quency: 0.05) is causal (C); a common and a rare haplotypes
(frequency<0.05) are causal (RC); and two rare haplotypes are
causal (RR). The disease model is taken to be additive, in that
two copies of the risk haplotype double the log odds of being
affected. These haplotype distributions (column Popl) and ORs
for the disease models are given in Table 1. Two phenocopy rates
at 5% and 10% are considered for this and the other two simu—
lations, with the corresponding population prevalence for each
combination of disease model and haplotype distribution given
in the Supplementary Table S3. To simulate trio data, haplotypes
for parents are generated first, and one haplotype from each
parent is chosen at random to pass down to the descendant.
Disease status of the descendant is simply based on the
binomial probability inferred from the models described above.

A total of 500 case—parent triads are obtained based on this simu—
lation procedure. Phase information is removed and only triad
genotype data are used in famLBL. Because LBL is only applic—
able to case—control data, we only retained the genotype data for
the affected children, leading to 500 affected cases. We then
randomly sample 500 unaffected individuals as controls.

3.1.2 Simulation 2 In the second simulation study, the setting
simulates a stratified population. The purpose of this setting is to
show that famLBL is not sensitive, whereas the original LBL
based on case—control data is sensitive, to population stratifica—
tion. We hypothesize a stratified population with two
subpopulations. The haplotype distributions under these two
subpopulations (columns Popl and Pop2) are given in Table 1.
The RR, RC and C disease models are the same for both
populations. For trio data, parents are assumed to come from
a 5(PSO% mixture of populations 1 and 2. The descendants’
haplotypes are retained as cases for the case—control data. The
controls are generated randomly from a 8&20% mixture of
populations 1 and 2. Again, phase information is deleted (i.e.,
only genotypes are retained) before the famLBL and LBL
analyses.

3.1.3 Simulation 3 The last simulation study is casted under
the same homogeneous population, haplotype settings and dis—
ease models as in the first simulation study. This set of simulation

is aimed to compare the performance of two family-based
methods for detecting haplotype association: famLBL versus
FBAT.

3.2 Results and comparisons

For each analysis, 40 000 MCMC iterations were run, which
appears to be sufﬁciently large for obtaining meaningful results
based on convergence diagnostics developed by Raftery and
Lewis (1992). Results for both famLBL and LBL from the first
set of simulation assuming a homogeneous population with 10%
phenocopy rate are presented in Figure 1. Recall that famLBL
uses 500 trios (which may be thought of as 500 affected children
and 500 matched “pseudo controls’), whereas LBL uses 500
affected children and 500 independent controls. We can see
that both famLBL and LBL are able to control the type I
error rates; they are all at or below 5%, marked by the gray
dashed line. The exact numbers are given in Supplementary
Table S4. We also considered a larger BF threshold to control
the type I error rate at the 1% level (Supplementary Table SS).
Both methods are powerful for detecting common variants, but
the power is much lower when the variants are rare, even though
the effect size is larger for the rare variant in the RC scenario.

 

 

On the other hand, when both associated haplotypes are rare, the
effect size plays a larger role, leading to greater power for detect-
ing the rarer haplotype with larger OR. As expected, the power
of famLBL is universally smaller than LBL due to dependency in
data, although the differences are all quite small. Results for
the 5% phenocopy rate convey the same information
(Supplementary Figure S2). Because the results are very similar
for the three sets of a and b parameter values that we considered
(a : b : 15, 20, 25), we choose to only use a : b : 20 for the
next two sets of simulation.

For the second set of simulation under population substruc-
ture, the type I error rates and the power are presented in
Figure 2. Each plot depicts both type I error (for non-causal
variant; left side) and power (for causal variants; right side)
that are separated by a vertical line. In the presence of popula-
tion substructure, we can see that LBL can have wildly inflated
type I error rates, afﬁrming the lack of robustness for popula-
tion-based designs. For example, haplotype 10011 and 11111
under haplotype setting 1 (H51) and the RR disease model
(top-left plot) have quite different frequencies in the two subpo-
pulations and thus greatly inflated type I error rates. On the
other hand, because the internal matched “pseudo control’ in
the trio design comes from the same population as the affected

(2013), we focus on a dichotomous hypertensive trait, in which
hypertension is deﬁned to be systolic blood pressure 3140 mm
Hg or diastolic blood pressure 390 mm Hg. Further, as the
primary utility of famLBL is to follow up on regions with initial
association signals to understand the causal mechanism, we focus
on nine top associated SNPs (referred to as target SNPs) identi—
ﬁed in Han et al. (2013) (Supplementary Table S6). For each of
the nine target SNPs, we considered haplotypes spanning
seven—SNP regions including the target SNP. Table 2 presents
part of the results, with the full results given in Supplementary
Tables S7 and S8. Six of the nine target SNPs return
signiﬁcantly associated haplotypes, with many of them being
rare (frequency 5 0.05), signaling their potential roles of tagging
rare SNVs.

4 DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK

In this article, we propose famLBL, a family—based method
for detecting haplotype association with common diseases,
speciﬁcally gearing toward rare haplotypes yet retaining

sufﬁcient power for detecting common haplotype
associations. Such a method is timely in that there is a
continuing recognition that rare haplotype constructed
based on GWAS common SNPs may tag multiple rare causal
SNVs not genotyped in GWAS. It is even more attractive
considering the fact that the use of common SNPs from the
GWAS era is much more economical (in fact, ‘free’, as no further
genotyping is needed) than using new SNVs obtained from NGS.
In addition, the use of a haplotype—based method can provide
greater statistical power for detecting association compared with
a collapsing—based method. Most importantly, by detecting
speciﬁc associated haplotypes instead of simply a regional
significant result from a collapsing—based test, a haplotype—
based method can uncover crucial information useful for
designing follow—up experiment to identify/validate causal
variants.

Based on an extensive simulation study, we thoroughly
investigated the properties of famLBL and documented its
success in detecting haplotype associations, both rare and
common. This is a signiﬁcant step forward in two fronts.

Note: The bold type within each haplotype indicates the position and the allele of
the target SNP.

First, compared with population—based methods for detect—
ing rare associated haplotypes, famLBL is not sensitive to
population stratification, and thus, its type I error is well
under control with good power. This finding is important
because of recent surge of interests in returning to family
data to find rare causal variants (Bowden, 2011; De et al.,
2013; Zhu et al., 2010). Second, our results show that famLBL
can be much more powerful than popular traditional
family—based association methods for detecting rare associated
haplotypes. Even though the underlying methodology of
famLBL is geared toward the detection of associations that
involve rare haplotypes by shrinking the estimated effect sizes
of the unassociated ones, the power of famLBL for detecting
associations of common haplotypes is still comparable with a
method that has much smaller power for detecting rare
associated haplotypes. Application of famLBL to the FHS illus—
trates its practical utility.

From a methodological perspective, the statistical approach
adopted in famLBL is Bayesian LASSO, a method proven to
be effective for detecting rare associated haplotypes by shrinking
the coefﬁcients (representing effect sizes) of unassociated haplo—
types toward zero (signifying no association) (Biswas and Lin,
2012). By doing so, the effect sizes of the truly associated ones
can be more precisely estimated. This leads to increased statis—
tical power for detecting rare associated haplotypes without
increasing type I error nor sacriﬁcing power for detecting
common associated ones.

Implementation of famLBL requires the use of MCMC
methodology for parameter estimation and statistical inference.
This versatile statistical technique, however, is computationally
intensive. For each dataset simulated under the homoge—
neous population model, the computational time for famLBL
with 40 000 MCMC iterations running on an Intel i3
2520 (2.5G) CPU with 8 GB memory took about 12, 20
and 50 s for haplotype settings 1 (6 haplotypes), 2 (9 haplotypes)
and 3 (12 haplotypes), respectively. The amount of time
taken to analyze a dataset simulated under the population
stratification model is similar. As such, famLBL is not
intended to be used as a genome—wide initial screening
method. Rather, famLBL is likely to be most proﬁtable as a
follow—up tool on regions showing signals in initial screening,

especially in regions under linkage peaks uncovered in family
studies.

In the current article, we focus on detecting rare haplotype
association with a binary trait. Nevertheless, famLBL can be
extended to other phenotypes, including general qualitative or
quantitative traits. Extension to extended pedigrees, on the other
hand, is much more complicated. The most difﬁcult issue stems
from the potential of missing data with larger pedigrees and the
no—recombination constraints, making an efﬁcient MCMC
algorithm much more difﬁcult to devise. However, given the
greater information contained in larger pedigrees and the
availability of such data already in existence, research into this
extension is warranted.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The recent advances in genome sequencing have re-
vealed an abundance of non-synonymous polymorphisms among
human individuals; subsequently, it is of immense interest and import-
ance to predict whether such substitutions are functional neutral or
have deleterious effects. The accuracy of such prediction algorithms
depends on the quality of the multiple-sequence alignment, which is
used to infer how an amino acid substitution is tolerated at a given
position. Because of the scarcity of orthologous protein sequences in
the past, the existing prediction algorithms all include sequences of
protein paralogs in the alignment, which can dilute the conservation
signal and affect prediction accuracy. However, we believe that, with
the sequencing of a large number of mammalian genomes, it is now
feasible to include only protein orthologs in the alignment and improve
the prediction performance.

Results: We have developed a novel prediction algorithm, named
SNPdryad, which only includes protein orthologs in building a multiple
sequence alignment. Among many other innovations, SNPdryad uses
different conservation scoring schemes and uses Random Forest as a
classifier. We have tested SNPdryad on several datasets. We found
that SNPdryad consistently outperformed other methods in several
performance metrics, which is attributed to the exclusion of paralo-
gous sequence. We have run SNPdryad on the complete human
proteome, generating prediction scores for all the possible amino
acid substitutions.

1 INTRODUCTION

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are single nucleotide
variations between different individuals of the same species.
They account for the majority of the genetic variations among
human individuals, as it is estimated that a single SNP is present

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

in every 2000 nt between any two individuals (Altshuler et al.,
2010; Stranger et al., 2007). Depending on how the amino acid is
affected by the polymorphism, the SNPs in the protein coding
regions can be classiﬁed into synonymous SNP (those that do
not change amino acid), non-synonymous SNP (nsSNP) (those
change the amino acid) and nonsense mutations (where a SNP
results in a stop codon). Based on the data from the 1000
Genomes Project, it is estimated that on an average a human
individual possesses 1000(L11000 non-synonymous substitu-
tions compared with the reference human genome sequence
(Abecasis et al., 2010). A number of databases had been de-
veloped to curate and store these human SNP data, which in-
clude dbSNP, OMIM, SNdee and deSFP (Amberger et al.,
2009; Liu et al., 2013; Schaefer et al., 2012; Sherry et al., 2001).

In addition to SNPs found in the protein coding regions,
recent genome-wide association and expression Quantitative
Trait Loci (eQTL) studies and the large-scale ENCODE project
also revealed many SNPs located outside of the protein coding
regions (called regulatory SNPs or rSNPs) that are also impli-
cated in human diseases. However, these rSNPs are not discussed
here, as we only focus on the effect of SNPs found in the protein
coding regions. Synonymous SNPs are usually assumed to be
functional neutral because they do not change the protein se-
quence, but in rare cases they can affect protein folding, disrupt
RNA secondary structure or disrupt miRNA binding sites
(Johnson et al., 2011; Kimchi-Sarfaty et al., 2007; Lin et al.,
2011; Shabalina et al., 2013). Although many nsSNPs are prob-
ably selectively neutral, i.e. having little functional effects, a sub-
stantial fraction of these nsSNPs are indeed predicted to be
deleterious because they can potentially disrupt functional sites
on a protein or affect their correct folding (Lohmueller et al.,
2008). Many nsSNPs are also linked to human disorders; many
of these disease associated SNPs are documented in databases,
such as OMIM, pharmGKB and HGMD (Adzhubei et al., 2010;
Amberger et al., 2009; Sunyaev et al., 2001). Because of the po-
tential functional consequences of nsSNPs, several computa-
tional methods had been developed to in silico predict whether
an nsSNP is deleterious. Some of these methods include SIFT,
PolyPhen, PolyPhen2, SNPs3D, SNAP and MutationTaster
(Adzhubei et al., 2010; Bromberg et al., 2008; Ng and
Henikoff, 2003; Schwarz et al., 2010; Sunyaev et al., 2001; Yue
et al., 2006). These methods usually work by estimating the like-
lihood that a mutation (nsSNP) is tolerated based on whether the

SNPdryad: Predicting deleterious amino acid substitutions

 

amino acid residue is observed in other evolutionarily related
orthologous or paralogous protein sequences or sequence frag-
ments, and whether the mutation is tolerated based on protein
structure and the physiochemical properties of the amino acids.
The major differences among these methods are how these evo-
lutionary and structural features are extracted, and what algo-
rithm (classiﬁer) is used in combining these features to make a
decision. There also exist ensemble methods, such as Condel and
Logit, which use Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression, respect-
ively, to combine individual prediction methods (Gonzalez-Perez
and Lopez-Bigas, 2011; Li et al., 2013).

As described above, an accurate and unbiased multiple
sequence alignment of a protein of interest with its orthologous
and paralogous sequences is essential to derive a conservation
proﬁle of the protein, which can be used to estimate how a mu-
tation is tolerated (Hicks et al., 2011). Ideally, only orthologous
sequences should be used in this step because these orthologs are
expected to perform similar function in related organisms,
and the corresponding amino acid position is expected to have
the same evolutionary, biophysical and structural constraint.
However, to the best of our knowledge, all the current nsSNP
analysis algorithms include paralogous sequences in the multiple
sequence alignment (MSA) step, which perhaps was a necessity a
few years ago because of the scarcity of the fully sequenced
proteome sequences. However, inclusion of paralogous se-
quences can potentially introduce noises in generating protein
sequence conservation proﬁles because when compared with
orthologs, protein paralogs are more likely to diverge in sequence
and in cellular functions. On an average, the amino acid sequence
identity between paralogous protein pairs is only 30% (Axelsen
et al., 2007).

The recent breakthroughs in sequencing technology have
generated fully sequenced genomes and proteomes for a large
number of vertebrates, which potentially can eliminate the need
for including paralogous protein sequences in building multiple
sequence alignment. In this article, we show that, by including
only orthologous protein sequences, we achieved better perform-
ance in predicting deleterious nsSNPs. Other innovations in
our method include the choice of using Random Forest in clas-
sification, which had been previously shown to be effective in
high-dimension data classiﬁcation (Caruana et al., 2008). We
benchmarked our prediction method, termed SNPdryad, against
other methods and showed that SNPdryad consistently achieved
better sensitivity and speciﬁcity on the datasets tested.

2 METHODS

2.1 Overview of the SNPdryad algorithm

Figure 1 summarizes the overall design of SNPdryad. The input of
SNPdryad is a non-synonymous human SNP and the sequence of the
human protein that the SNP is on; the output is the predicted deleterious
score for the input nsSNP. The higher the score, the more deleterious the
input nsSNP is predicted to be.

2.2 Collecting orthologous protein sequences

We ran the Inparanoid program to obtain orthologous protein sequences
from other organisms (Ostlund et al., 2010); the human proteins were
extracted from Ensembl (GRCh37). To ensure the quality of the ﬁnal

Fig. 1. Overall design of the SNPdryad algorithm. Given an nsSNP and
the human protein, SNPdryad collects the orthologous protein sequences
from other mammals and performs a multiple-sequence alignment
(MSA). Once aligned, SNPdryad calculates features from the alignment
and uses the trained Random Forest classiﬁer to predict and output a
deleterious effect score

multiple sequence alignment, we limited our ortholog search to only
mammalian species [Pongo pygmaeus abelii (PPYG2), Mus musculus
(NCBIM37), Macaca mulatta (MMUL_1), Cam's familiaris
(BROADDZ), Equus caballus (Eunab2), Rattus norvegicus (RGSC3.4),
Cavia porcellus (caVPor3), Bos taurus (UMD3.1) and Monodelphis
domestica (BROADOS)]. Such an approach has been proven to be suc-
cessful in detecting conserved regulatory elements (Xie et al., 2005).

2.3 Generating sequence alignment proﬁle

We used the MUSCLE software for multiple-sequence alignment, using
the default parameter setting (Edgar, 2004). Other alignment tools such as
MAFFT and Clustal were also tested; MUSCLE was picked because of
its alignment accuracy and speed (Edgar, 2004). Given a multiple
sequence alignment, the next step is to derive a positional-speciﬁc con-
servation proﬁle and use it to estimate the tolerance toward mutations at
each position. Two important calibrations are needed at this step: how to
weight each input protein sequence, and how to score the amino acid
substitutions. Kumar and colleagues previously showed that the choice of
sequence-weighting scheme and substitution-scoring scheme are crucial at
this step in distinguishing the deleterious nsSNPs from the rest (Kumar
et al., 2009); therefore, we explored four different sequence-weighting
schemes and two different substitution-scoring schemes in our work
(a total of eight distinct ways of measuring conservation scores). All of
the eight conservations scores were input into SNPdryad as features and
were automatically weighted and selected by Random Forest classifier to
achieve the best performance.

2.4 Constructing feature vectors

2.4.1 Sequence-weighting schemes (i) In the ﬁrst sequence-weighting
scheme, each individual input protein sequence is treated equally and
given the same weight. (ii) In the second sequence-weighting scheme, a
weight is calculated for each input protein sequence based on its overall
sequence similarity to the human protein sequence. In particular, the sum
of pair-wise BLOSUM62 alignment score is computed as the weight to
quantify the pair-wise sequence similarity. The higher the sequence simi-
larity (sum of BLOSUM62 scores), the higher weight is given to the input
sequence. Such a weighting scheme is different from the ones used in
PolyPhen2, SIFT and other prediction methods, which in contrast give
low weight to the sequence that is highly similar to the human sequence.
The rationale in their approaches is that such a low weight can eliminate
redundant or highly similar sequences when searching for homologous
sequences in a large sequence database. In contrast, SNPdryad does not
have such drawbacks because only orthologous protein sequences are
allowed in the alignment. SNPdryad can conﬁdently assign a high

weight to a similar orthologous sequence that is believed to be function-
ally consistent with the human sequence. (iii) In the third weighting
scheme, each input sequence is weighted according to their evolutionary
distance from human. We ﬁrst ran the PhyML program on the aligned
sequences to build a phylogenetic tree (Guindon et al., 2010); each se-
quence is then assigned the weight of 1 minus the additive branch length
to human sequence. (iv) In the fourth approach, we adopted the same
scheme as in the weighting method used in the ‘evolutionary trace’
(Mihalek et al., 2004). This method takes into account the sequence con-
servation at multiple levels of the phylogenetic tree constructed and
assigns weights globally.

2.4.2 Substitution-scoring schemes We tested two substitution-
scoring schemes in estimating the conservation level at each amino acid
position: information entropy (Shannon Entropy) and simple
BLOSUM62 scores. The former is an unbiased measure of amino acid
conservation, whereas the latter can take into account the biophysical
properties of each amino acid. In the end, by combining four different
sequence-weighting schemes and two different substitution-scoring
schemes, we calculated eight different conservation scores for each
amino acid at each position that has an nsSNP in the human protein
sequence. Next, we calculated the differences in conservation score be-
tween the reference allele and the variant allele and incorporated it as a
feature into the classiﬁcation model.

Overall Conservation Statistics: Besides the conservation score calcu-
lated at the nsSNP-containing column in the multiple-sequence alignment,
the mean and standard deviation of the entropy of the alignment is also
calculated. Z-score can thus be calculated for the nsSNP-containing
column.

2.4.3 Physiochemical properties of amino acids In addition to
sequence conservation proﬁle, we also included the physiochemical prop-
erties of the amino acids as a feature in our classiﬁcation scheme. The
following properties are included: hydropathy index (Kyte and Doolittle,
1982), polarity (Cooper and Hausman, 2007), mass (Reichert and Suhnel,
2002), volume (Zamyatnin, 1972), surface area (Chothia, 1976), residue
non-polar surface area (Karplus, 1997), estimated hydrophobic effects for
residue burial and side chain (Karplus, 1997), population percentage of
being exposed in solvent, being buried in solvent and being neither
exposed nor buried in solvent (Bordo and Argos, 1991). We note that
these features are not independent from each other.

2.4.4 Other features To alleviate the noise and ﬂuctuation in the
data, the number of protein sequences included in the multiple-sequence
alignment and the number of distinct amino acid residues in the nsSNP-
containing column are also used as features in the classiﬁer. The rationale
for such treatment is that the conservation scores derived from alignment
of higher number of sequences are deemed more reliable than scores
derived from fewer sequences. In addition, functional annotation of the
region on the protein where the SNP is present is also important. Based
on such a rationale, we have included the presence of the annotations
from PFAM, SUPERFAMILY and PROSITE as the features for pre-
dictions (Hulo et al., 2006; Punta et al., 2012; Wilson et al., 2009). The
complete list of features used is listed in Supplementary Table S].

2.5 Classiﬁcation methods

We evaluated 10 leading classiﬁcation methods, applied them onto the
aforementioned features and benchmarked their performance following a
standard 10-fold cross-validation procedure. These methods include
Random Forest (Breiman, 2001), Naive Bayes (John and Langley,
1995), Bayes Network (Cooper and Herskovits, 1992), Multilayer
Perceptron (Bishop, 1995), AdaBoost (Freund and Schapire, 1996),
Support Vector Machine using Polynomial Kernel (Burges, 1998),
Support Vector Machine using Radial Basis Kernel (Burges, 1998) and

three k-Nearest Neighbor Classiﬁers (Cover and Hart, 1967). These
methods are implemented in software WEKA (Hall et al., 2009); their
parameter settings are well-tuned and described in the Supplementary
Text.

2.6 Datasets

To ensure a fair comparison, we have downloaded the datasets from the
PolyPhen-2 Web site, namely HumDiv and HumVar (version 2.1.0)
(Adzhubei et al., 2010). Both datasets were compiled from UniProtKB
(Magrane and Consortium, 2011). Speciﬁcally, HumDiv was compiled
using the annotation keywords, which imply causal mutationiphenotype
relationships, whereas HumVar was compiled from all the human
disease-causing mutations annotated. HumDiv has 7070 neutral
nsSNPs and 5322 deleterious nsSNPs, whereas HumVar has 21 142 neu-
tral nsSNPs and 20989 deleterious nsSNPs. In particular, HumDiv is
considered higher in quality than HumVar because the SNPs in
HumDiv were selected using a controlled set of keywords.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Classiﬁcation model selections in SNPdryad

We trained and tested the aforementioned 10 classiﬁcation
models on HumDiv and HumVar, following the standard
10-fold cross-validation. The results are shown in Table 1 for
HumDiv and HumVar. It is clear that, for each classiﬁcation
method and for both HumDiv and HumVar, using only ortho-
logous proteins had a better performance than inclusion of par-
alogous proteins. Not only did the orthologs-only approach
achieve better prediction accuracy and Area Under Receiver
Operating Characteristics (ROC) Curve (AUC), but it also had
lower level of error. In addition, the Random Forest method had
the best performance; this is also consistent with a previous com-
parison study showing that Random Forest is the best in high-
dimensions empirically (Caruana et al., 2008). The predictive
power of the Random Forest classiﬁer lies in its ensemble
nature with bagging and random subspace techniques. Instead
of relying on a single-decision tree, Random Forest takes into
account the votes of multiple decision trees to make the final
prediction decision.

3.2 Comparisons on the HumDiv and HumVar datasets

Next, we compared the prediction performance of SNPdryad
(using only orthologs and Random Forest classiﬁer) with other
commonly used nsSNP analysis methods, MutationTaster,
PolyPhen2 and SIFT (Adzhubei et al., 2010; Ng and Henikoff,
2003; Schwarz et al., 2010). Some other prediction methods such
as SNPs3D were not included in the comparison because they are
no longer actively maintained Hue et al., 2006). Ensemble meth-
ods such as Condel, which reanalyze results from other methods,
are not included in the comparison either. We used the HumDiv
and HumVar datasets for the basis of the comparison. PolyPhen2
and other methods also used the same datasets in evaluations. To
ensure an objective and unbiased comparison, we downloaded the
prediction results from the web servers of PolyPhen2, SIFT and
MutationTaster, respectively, in January 2012. Figure 2 compares
the ROC curves and the Precision-Recall curves for these four
methods. It is clear from Figure 2 that SNPdryad outperforms
all three other methods on both HumDiv and HumVar datasets,
whereas PolyPhen2 has the second best performance. We like to

note that PolyPhen2 was fully trained on the same HumDiv and
HumVar datasets, whereas the other methods were not; this may
complicate the comparison.

After comparing the overall prediction accuracy, we next
investigated how frequently the methods agreed with each
other on whether an nsSNP is considered deleterious. Because
these methods use different statistical schemes to denote predic-
tion confidence or degree of harmful effect, it is impossible to
select a single statistical threshold (e. g. a single P-value) to apply
to all methods and compare the predictions that are above this
threshold. To overcome this problem, for each method, we ﬁrst
selected all the nsSNP that are predicted to be deleterious and
ranked these nsSNPs according to this specific method’s own
scoring scheme, from the most deleterious to the least deleteri-
ous. We then compared the overlap among the top ranked
nsSNPs predicted by each method. The resultant Venn diagrams
are shown in Figure 3. Three observations can be made from
these Venn diagrams. (i) At a lower cutoff, the methods have a
greater level of overlap in their predictions; however, among the
top predicted nsSNPs, the overlapping fraction becomes much
smaller. (ii) The nsSNPs that are predicted to be deleterious by
more than one method are always more accurate than those
predicted by a single method. Notably, such observation is in
contrast to a previous study (Li et al., 2012). A possible

explanation is that SNPdryad and PolyPhen2 are trained on
the same datasets, boosting their ensemble performance. (iii)
SNPdryad predicts more unique deleterious nsSNP that are
missed by the others at a higher accuracy. For example,
among the top 10% predicted nsSNPs, SNPdryad predicted
260 unique deleterious nsSNPs alone (256 are true positives,
accuracy 2 98%).

We next ranked the nsSNPs from HumDiv by the predicted
scores of each of the three methods, and calculated the pair-wise
Spearman’s rank correlation coefﬁcients. As a comparison, we
also calculated the correlations with the annotated deleterious
effect provided in the HumDiv dataset (0 denotes neutral and
1 denotes deleterious). Table 2 shows that among the four meth-
ods, SNPdryad has the highest correlation with Annotation
(0.83) than the others, suggesting that SNPdryad has higher
accuracy than other methods.

3.3 Exclusion of paralogs contributes to better
performance in SNPdryad

After concluding that SNPdryad is accurate in predicting dele-

terious nsSNPs, at least on the HumDiv and HumVar datasets,

we next investigated whether such a superior performance was

the result of either a better classiﬁer (Random Forest) or the fact

Fig. 3. Venn diagram showing the overlap between deleterious nsSNPs
predicted by SNPdryad, PolyPhen2, SIFT and MutationTaster on the
HumDiv dataset on which they all made successful predictions. The red,
green, blue and gray ellipses denote the predictions of SNPdryad,
PolyPhen2, SIFT and MutationTaster, respectively. The numbers indi-
cate the number of predicted deleterious nsSNP, whereas the bracketed
numbers indicate the number of true positive predictions. In HumDiv,
44% of the SNPs were previously annotated as deleterious; therefore, in
panel (a) we selected and compared the top 44% of the predictions made
by each method. Panel (b) compares the top 10% predictions made by
each method

that we only included orthologous protein sequences. We com-
pared the AUC values of PolyPhen2 (Figure 2A and 2B, 0.95 for
HumDiv and 0.89 for HumVar) to the AUC values of different
classiﬁers that we tested in SNPdryad (Table 1). It can be seen

from Table 1 that if homologous sequences are used, PolyPhen2
has higher AUC than all the classiﬁcation models except for
Random Forest (0.96). However, the top half of the Table 1
shows that if only orthologous sequences are used, several
other classiﬁcation methods such as BNet (Bayesian Net),
MLP (MultiLayer Perceptron) and AB (AdaBoost) actually
have better AUC scores (0.96) than PolyPhen2 (0.95). Such com-
parisons showed that the decision of including only orthologous
protein sequences is the primary reason for the good prediction
power of SNPdryad.

To further illustrate such an idea, two examples of deleterious
nsSNPs are shown in the Supplementary Figures S17S6, which
are correctly predicted by SNPdryad but by neither PolyPhen2
nor SIFT. These cases demonstrate that the quality of the MSA
is crucial in accurately predicting deleterious nsSNPs. The ﬁrst
case is a SNP located at the position 1161 of the Complement C3
protein (P01024), which changes a Glutamine residue (Q) to a
Lysine residue (K), causing increased susceptibility to hemolytic
uremic syndrome atypical type 5 (AHUS5) (UniProt variation
ID: VAR_063219). Supplementary Figures S17S3 compare the
MSAs generated by SNPdryad, PolyPhen2 and SIFT, respect-
ively. The substitutions to Lysine (K) or Arginine (R) are found
in the alignments generated by both PolyPhen2 (Supplementary
Figure S3) and SIFT (Supplementary Figure S2), misleading
these algorithms to predict this particular SNP as a neutral
substitution in human. This is likely caused by the inclusion
of protein sequences paralogous to the input human protein.
In contrast, neither Lysine (K) nor Arginine (R) is found in
the orthologous sequence alignment computed by SNPdryad,
which accurately predicted this nsSNP as deleterious
(Supplementary Figure S1). Supplementary Figures S4eS6
show another example of a mutation at position 104 on
human Transthyretin protein (P02766), which changes an
Isoleucine (I) to a Serine residue (S) (UniProt ID:
VAR_007584). This deleterious mutation has been shown to con-
tribute to transthyretin—related amyloidosis (AMYL-TTR). The
sequence alignments generated by both SIFT (Supplementary
Figure S5) and PolyPhen2 (Supplementary Figure S6) include
residue Serine at position 104, which likely caused both pro-
grams to predict this substitution as a neutral one. SNPdryad
accurately predicted this mutation as a deleterious mutation
(Supplementary Figure S4).

3.4 Prediction on nsSNPs annotated in SNdee

Next, as an independent benchmark, we used SNPdryad to make
predictions on the nsSNPs curated in the SNdee database, and
compared the results of SNPdryad, PolyPhen2, SIFT and
MutationTaster. SNdee is a comprehensive database that col-
lects and annotates SNP information from multiple sources,
including dbSNP, SwissProt, OMIM and 1000 Genomes

(URL: http://www.rostlab.org/services/snpdbe/) (Schaefer et al.,
2012). A small subset of these SNPs has disease association in-
formation. Based on the SNdee database dump (March 2012),
we have compiled a dataset, which is given in Supplementary
Table S3. Figure 4 depicts the ROC curves and the Precision-
Recall curves for these four methods. Again, SNPdryad has the
best performance among these methods.

3.5 Prediction on nsSNPs annotated in ExoVar

As another independent benchmark dataset, we have selected the
latest ExoVar dataset (Li et al., 2013). ExoVar consists of not
only the UniProt annotations but also the recent rare nsSNPs
in the 1000 Genomes Project. To be consistent with the past
study (Li et al., 2013), we have removed the variants that are
not derived alleles. As shown in Figure 5, the performance of
SNPdryad is similar to that of Logit and better than all the other
methods, including PolyPhen2 and MutationTaster. It is worth
noting that both Logit and Condel are ensemble methods, which
take input predictions from individual methods and output a
weighted average. SNPdryad has the best performance among
all the independent methods.

3.6 Predictions on human proteome

In this section, we ﬁrst trained SNPdryad on the HumDiv data-
set then ran it on the entire human proteome (Ensembl version
GRCh37.64) for all the possible substitutions at all the amino
acid positions. Note, in this sense, we are testing the functional
effect of amino acid substitutions instead of on nsSNPs.
Prediction Score Distribution: Supplementary Figure S7 de-
picts the average prediction scores for all the possible pair-wise
substitutions between 20 amino acid residues, averaged over all
the possible amino acid positions in the human proteome. The
complete predictions can be accessed at our Website: http://snps.
ccbr.utoronto.ca:8080/SNPdryad/. In general, not surprisingly,
we observe that the predicted deleterious effect of replacing
one amino acid by another is consistent with their similarity in
physiochemical properties. In particular, most of the non-
synonymous substitutions to Tryptophan (W) are likely to be
deleterious and most of the non-synonymous substitutions to
Alanine (A) are likely functional neutral. Furthermore, Serine

(S) and Threonine (T) are mostly interchangeable to each other
based on the prediction scores.

In total, we scanned 92012 human proteins (including protein
isoforms) and 36 935 804 amino acid positions; a total of
10 120 155 substitutions (~1.4%) were predicted to be fully dele-
terious (with the SNPdryad prediction score of 1).

Next, we investigated whether such fully deleterious SNPs are
enriched or depleted among common human variants. To
achieve this, we ﬁltered the nsSNPs annotated in the SNdee
database, and retained only those common nsSNPs that have
major allele frequency >0.05, as estimated by the 1000
Genomes Project. This resulted in 14733 nsSNPs on 6645 pro-
teins (designated as Query set). Among them, 627 nsSNPs were
predicted by SNPdryad to be fully deleterious. As a Background
control dataset, we also took the same 6645 human proteins, and
simulated all the possible non-synonymous substitutions at all
positions under the constraint that their amino acid type changes
[e.g. Arginine (R) to Glutamine (Q)] do exist in the aforemen-
tioned 14 733 common variants. The resultant Background had
32246488 nsSNPs, among which 2529197 nsSNPs were pre-
dicted to be fully deleterious by SNPdryad. By computing the
hypergeometric cumulative distribution function between the
Query set and Background set, we observed signiﬁcant deple-
tion of fully deleterious nsSNPs among the common nsSNPs
(Query Set) with P< 1.0674 x 10’“. Such depletion of highly
deleterious SNPs, while fully expected, further demonstrated
the value and effectiveness of prediction algorithms such as
SNPdryad.

PFAM Domain Statistics: We are interested to know where
these fully deleterious substitutions are located, especially which
PFAM protein domains are enriched of such extremely deleteri-
ous substitutions. Supplementary Table S2 lists the top PFAM
domains that contain the highest number of harmful (i.e. fully
deleterious) nsSNPs. It shows that the G protein coupled recep-
tor (GPCR) domain (PF00001) contains the highest number of
harmful nsSNPs as predicted by SNPdryad. GPCR domains are
important domains in cell-surface receptors, which sense mol-
ecules outside of cells in many disease-causing signaling path-
ways. They are also important therapeutic targets, as ~40% of
all modern drugs target GPCR proteins (Filmore, 2004). We also

used odds-ratio to ascertain the statistical significance of these
enrichments (last column). (Assuming every sequence position in
every human protein are equally likely to be hit by a harmful
nsSNP, we deﬁne the sum of the sequence lengths of the domain
hits of a Pfam domain D as [D in a human proteome. We also
deﬁne the sum of the sequence lengths of all the proteins in the
human proteome as [Tm]. Given a harmful nsSNP, the probabil-
ity that it is located at the domain D is calculated as [ii]. If we
have N harmful nsSNPs, the expected number of their hits
located at the domain D can be calculated as N x [11.3"]. Based
on such an idea, the expected nsSNP hits are calculated for
each domain. The odds-ratio of a domain is then calculated as
the number of observed deleterious nsSNPs residing in a domain,
divided by the expected number of deleterious nsSNPs in the

domain.)

 

 

4 DISCUSSION

In this article, we described SNPdryad, a novel computational
method that can predict deleterious effect of amino acid substi-
tutions occurred in human proteins. As elaborated in this article,
SNPdryad outperforms other leading algorithms in accurately
predicting deleterious nsSNPs. We demonstrated that this is pri-
marily because SNPdryad only includes orthologous sequences
in building the multiple-sequence alignment, as opposed to other
contemporary methods, which include paralogous sequences as
well. Such an innovation allows construction of a more accurate
protein sequence conservation profile, allowing a more precise
estimate on whether a substitution is tolerated at a specific pos-
ition. This would not have been possible until now, when a large
number of mammalian or vertebrate genome sequences have
been completely sequenced, thanks to the drastically decreasing
cost of genomic sequencing. The next-generation sequencing
technology has generated a deluge of genomic sequences and
subsequently, a wealth of genetic variation data such as non-
synonymous polymorphisms. We envision that an intelligent al-
gorithm such as SNPdryad can take advantage of this large
amount of data and further improve the accuracy of predicting
deleterious nsSNPs.

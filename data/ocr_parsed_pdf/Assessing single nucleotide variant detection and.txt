ABSTRACT

Motivation: Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is now routinely used
for the detection and identification of genetic variants, particularly
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in humans, and this has pro-
vided valuable new insights into human diversity, population histories
and genetic association studies of traits and diseases. However, this
relies on accurate detection and genotyping calling of the polymorph-
isms present in the samples sequenced. To minimize cost, the major-
ity of current WGS studies, including the 1000 Genomes Project
(1 KGP) have adopted low coverage sequencing of large number of
samples, where such designs have inadvertently influenced the devel-
opment of variant calling methods on WGS data. Assessment of vari-
ant accuracy are usually performed on the same set of low coverage
individuals or a smaller number of deeply sequenced individuals. It is
thus unclear how these variant calling methods would fare for a data-
set of ~100 samples from a population not part of the 1 KGP that have
been sequenced at various coverage depths.

Results: Using down-sampling of the sequencing reads obtained from
the Singapore Sequencing Malay Project (SSMP), and a set of SNP
calls from the same individuals genotyped on the Illumina Omni1-
Quad array, we assessed the sensitivity of SNP detection, accuracy
of genotype calls made and variant accuracy for six commonly used
variant calling methods of GATK, SAMtools, Consensus Assessment
of Sequence and Variation (CASAVA), VarScan, glfTools and
SOAPsnp. The results indicate that at 5x coverage depth, the multi-
sample callers of GATK and SAMtools yield the best accuracy par-
ticularly if the study samples are called together with a large number of
individuals such as those from 1000 Genomes Project. If study sam-
ples are sequenced at a high coverage depth such as 30x, CASAVA
has the highest variant accuracy as compared with the other variant
callers assessed.

1 INTRODUCTION

Fueled by rapidly decreasing costs and advancements in high-
throughput sequencing technologies, it is now possible to se-
quence one complete human genome at a fraction of the time
and cost of the initial Human Genome Project. These develop-
ments have thus transformed the field of human genomics stu-
dies and have contributed signiﬁcantly to our knowledge and
understanding of human diversity (The 1000 Genomes Project
Consortium, 2010, 2012) and population histories (Green et al.,
2010; Reich et al., 2010; Schuster et al., 2010), as well as aided the
identiﬁcation of causal variants for human diseases (Ng et al.,
2010) and traits (Morrison et al., 2013). The successful applica-
tion of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in these diverse fields
of studies, however, relies on the accurate detection and genotype
calling of the polymorphisms present in the individuals studied.
Compared with the traditional Sanger sequencing technology,
WGS by next-generation sequencing technologies have much
shorter reads and higher per-base sequencing error rates, which
confounds true polymorphisms from sequencing errors (Bentley
et al., 2008).

Intuitively, having high sequencing coverage data where each
base in the genome is sequenced multiple times will allow the true
polymorphisms to be better distinguished from the sequencing
errors. As such, single-sample variant calling methods will usu-
ally perform well with high coverage depth, but fare poorly when
applied to individuals sequenced at low coverage depths (Liet
et al., 2009b). However, deep WGS on a large number of indi-
viduals is currently not feasible economically.

Based on the results from a simulation study conducted (Le
and Durbin, 2011), it was found that for a given ﬁxed amount of
sequencing performed, sequencing a large number of individuals
at low coverage depths of L6x provide higher power in detect-
ing rare single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) than compared
with sequencing a smaller number of individuals at high coverage
depth. The former design is what has been adopted by the
l KGP. This, thus, resulted in the development of different vari-
ant calling methods that seek to generate accurate genotype calls
at variant sites identiﬁed across multiple individuals that have
been sequenced at low coverage depths. However, the assessment
of these variant calling methods are performed mainly on simu-
lated data and on a small number of individuals who have been
sequenced to high coverage depths of at least 30x.

In this work, we thus seek to investigate the following issues:
given a population-based sample of individuals such as the
Southeast Asian Malays that are not present in lKGP and are
deep whole-genome sequenced (Wong et al., 2013), which of
the variant calling methods (i) GATK (McKenna et al., 2010);
(ii) SAMtools (Li et al., 2009a); (iii) Consensus Assessment of
Sequence and Variation (CASAVA); (iv) VarScan (Koboldt
et al., 2009); (v) glfTools (http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abeca
sis/glfTools); or (vi) SOAPsnp (Li et al., 2009b) will have the
best performance in (i) variant discovery or detection; (ii) geno-
type calling and (iii) overall variant accuracy deﬁned as a product
of the two above metrics across sequencing coverage depths from
5 to 30x.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Samples and generation of sequencing and
genotyping data

In the Singapore Sequencing Malay Project (SSMP), 100 unrelated indi-
viduals (50 male and 50 female) of Southeast Asian Malay ancestry
residing in Singapore were pseudo-randomly selected from the multi-
ethnic cohort of the Singapore Population Health Study. Genomic
DNA for all 100 individuals was extracted and delivered to the
Illumina facility at Hayward, CA, USA, for WGS on the Illumina
HiSeq 2000, with a target sequencing coverage of 30x and having
paired-end reads of 2 x 100 bp. The sequenced reads were then mapped
to the human reference genome (NCBI Build 37) using the Efﬁcient
Large-Scale Alignment of Nucleotide Databases v.2e software, a compo-
nent of Illumina proprietary sequencing-analysis software CASAVA
v.1.8, where the alignment results are stored per sample in a single
BAM ﬁle. Four samples were subsequently excluded owing to population
structure outlier or anomalous distribution of insert sizes. To ensure con-
sistency in the analysis with different variant calling software, all of the
remaining 96 sample BAM ﬁles were re-headed with the UCSC th9
reference after checking for length and sequence inconsistencies. Reads
that are not properly aligned, mapped or paired, or deemed to be PCR
duplicates or those that did not pass the chastity ﬁlter in Illumina
CASAVA pipeline were removed from the BAM ﬁles. Approximately,
87.71 and 94.25% of the callable bases (excluding ‘N’ regions) in chromo-
somes 1 and 20, respectively, were still covered by the sequence reads.

Each of these 100 individuals was also genotyped on the Illumina
HumanOmnil-Quad (Omnil-Quad) array for internal QC measures by
the Illumina sequencing facility. Genotype calls were determined using
the Illumina Genome Studio (manifest version D) for 1 138 747 markers,
and the marker positions were later updated to NCBI Build 37 coordin-
ates. Markers that met any of the following criteria were then ﬁltered: (i)
invalid chromosomal position or strand; (ii) duplicated chromosomal
positions; (iii) high rates of missingness (call rate <95%) and (iv)
Hardineinberg equilibrium P<1074. This resulted in a ‘qc-cleaned’
set of 994 302 autosomal markers. In this evaluation, we only considered
the QC SNPs (excluding indels) on chromosomes 1 and 20 from the
Omnil-Quad array with no missing genotype calls in any of the 96 sam-
ples, thus yielding a set of 79 029 +26 805 = 105 834 loci (Table 1) and
105 834x 96:10 160 064 genotypes, which will be used as the ‘truth-
dataset’ for comparison.

2.2 Down-sampling of BAM ﬁles

Statistical down-sampling was performed with PICARD on the 30x
coverage BAM ﬁles where the original reads are scaled with a supplied
probability parameter and in the process retaining both reads in a read

pair. We thus down-sampled the 30x BAM ﬁles to 5, 10 and 20x with
the following probabilities of 1/6, 1/3 and 2/3, respectively.

2.3 Variant calling methods

There are basically two different types of variant calling methods: (i)
single-sample and (ii) multi-sample. Some methods such as CASAVA
are strictly single-sample callers, while others such as GATK and
SAMtools can be used as either single-sample or multi-sample calling.
We therefore applied GATK, SAMtools, CASAVA, VarScan, glfSingle
and SOAPsnp on each of the 96 individuals separately (as single-sample
caller where the method will be preﬁxed with a S- if it can also be used as
a multi-sample caller); GATK, SAMtools, VarScan and glfMultiples on
all 96 individuals together (multi-sample calling). In addition, we also
assessed the performance of both GATK and SAMtools as multi-
sample callers at 5 and 30x sequencing coverage by calling all 96
Malay individuals together with the 1092 low coverage whole-genome
sequenced samples from Phase 1 of the 1000 Genomes Project (preﬁx
with lkgp-). For variants on chromosome 1, we only assessed the per-
formance of the following callers: GATK, SAMtools (both single and
multi-sample calling) and CASAVA.

Different preprocessing steps were performed for the reads on chromo-
somes 1 and 20. In chromosome 1, reads were preprocessed according to
the standard procedures recommended for each variant calling methods,
while the same preprocessing steps (GATK IndelRealigner, PICARD’s
MarkDuplicates, GATK BaseRecalibrator) were applied on the chromo-
some 20 reads for all methods except CASAVA and SOAPsnp, which
have their preprocessing steps built into the methods.

For CASAVA, we applied the assembleIndels and callSmallVariants
modules in the CASAVA analysis suite and applied a Q20 variant quality
score threshold to obtain the variants detected and genotype calls.

In SAMtools, BAQ was enabled in mpileup, with reads with mapping
quality scores >90 used to calculate the likelihoods at all sites before
bcftools was applied to call the variants and genotypes. SNPs were ﬁl-
tered using the varFilter module in vcfutils, with the following quality
criteria: (i) variant quality >3; (ii) maximum read depth=mean read
depth+3 standard deviation of read depth; (iii) minimum read depth
of 3; and (iv) SNP must not be within 10 bp ofa gap.

GATK UniﬁedGenotyper was ﬁrst used to determine the variant calls
before ﬁltering was performed with the VQSR (VariantRecalibrator)
module at 99% truth sensitivity level.

The default parameters were used for variant calling in VarScan (con-
senus sequence with mpileuchns), glfTools and SOAPsnp before variants
were ﬁltered with variant quality of Q20 in the single-sample mode and
Q60 in the multi-sample modes (Liu et al., 2013).

2.4 Variant detection

To determine which of the variant calling methods perform the best in
terms of variant discovery or detection across the different sequencing

Assessing single nucleotide variant detection

 

coverage depths, we used two evaluation metrics. The ﬁrst metric is the
sensitivity of each variant calling method to correctly detect the poly-
morphic sites as identiﬁed on the Omnil-Quad array:

. . . Num_correct_polymorphic_loci
Senstttvttyz é
Num_polymorphtc_loct_array

where

Num_correct_polymorphic_loci is the number of polymorphic loci that
has been identiﬁed by both the variant calling method and Omni1-
Quad array where different alleles are present at the site for 96 SSMP
samples.

Numjolymorphic_loci_array is the total number of polymorphic loci
as identiﬁed on the Omnil-Quad array for 96 SSMP samples (sum of
rare, low and common frequency loci, which is a constant of 62 870
and 20 274 for chromosomes 1 and 20, respectively).

In addition, we also assessed a false-positive measure for each vari-
ant calling method by determining how many of the monomorphic
reference loci on the Omnil-Quad array, i.e. all 96 SSMP samples, are
identiﬁed to carry the homozygous reference genotypes at that loci, and
yet are erroneously determined to be a variant loci by the variant calling
method:

. . Num,incorrectjnonomorphicjoci
False_Postttve= +
Num .monomorphtc_ref_loct_array

where

Num_incorrect_monomorphic_loci is the number of loci determined to
be a variant site by the variant calling method, but all 96 SSMP sam-
ples carry the homozygous reference genotypes as identiﬁed from the
Omnil-Quad array.

Num_monomorphic_ref_loci_arra y is the total number of loci identiﬁed
in Omnil-Quad array where all 96 SSMP samples carry the homozy-
gous reference genotypes (constant of 14 635 and 6202 for chromo-
somes 1 and 20, respectively).

2.5 Genotype calls concordance

To determine which is the ‘best’ genotype caller, we assessed the concord-
ance of the genotypes made by each of the variant calling methods to
those genotypes identiﬁed on the Omnil-Quad array for each of the 96
SSMP samples at the variant loci across the various sequencing coverage
depths considered:

. . Num_correct_variant_loci enot es
VariantLoct,Concordance= 
Num_vammt_loct_genotypes_called

where

Num_correct_varian t_loci_genotypes is the number of genotypes whose
calls made by the variant calling method are concordant with that
obtained in the Omnil-Quad array at all variant loci.

Num_var[ant_loci_genotypes_called is the total number of genotypes
called by each variant calling method at all variant loci (where at least
1 of the 96 SSMP samples carry a variant allele according to Omni1-

Quad).

In this concordance measure, we are only measuring the proportion of
correct genotype calls made by each variant calling method, which is thus
unaffected by the sensitivity of the different methods. In addition, the
homozygous reference genotypes as identiﬁed from Omnil-Quad array
are not counted toward the concordance measure.

2.6 Variant accuracy
We then deﬁne an overall measure of variant accuracy where both sen-

sitivity and genotype concordance are considered to determine the ‘best’
variant calling method:

. Num_correct_variant_loci enot es
Variant_A ccuracy: 
Num,vartantJoctgenotypes

where

Num_correct_variant_loci_genotypes is the number of genotypes whose
calls are made by the variant calling method and are concordant with
that obtained in the Omnil-Quad array at all variant loci.
Num_variant_loci_genotypes is the total number of genotypes at all
variant loci that is a constant of 6 181 824 and 1 977 888 for chromo-
somes 1 and 20, respectively.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Assessing variant detection

It is clear that there exists a monotonically increasing relation-
ship between sequencing coverage depth and the sensitivity to
correctly determine the polymorphic sites (raw and ﬁltered) on
the Omnil-Quad array for all variant calling methods assessed
(Fig. 1A, Supplementary Figs S1 and S5A and Supplementary
Table S1). For most of the methods, there is only a marginal
increase in the number of additional polymorphic sites correctly
detected beyond 20x for both raw and ﬁltered sites
(Supplementary Table S1). It is somewhat surprising that at
30x coverage, GATK is unable to detect ~0.5, ~l.2 and
~l%, ~l.3% of the filtered common frequency variant loci as
compared with SAMtools and CASAVA for chromosomes 1
and 20, respectively. We believe this could likely be attributed
to GATK’s VQSR filtering, as the sensitivity achieved before
ﬁltering is comparable among the methods (Supplementary
Tables S2 and S5). Categorizing by minor allele frequencies,
we find that the increase in sequencing coverage depth primarily
identiﬁes additional rare (Fig. 1D and Supplementary Figs S4
and S5D) and low frequency (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Figs
S3 and S5C) sites, while the number of common frequency vari-
ant loci detected (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Figs S2 and S5B)
remains almost constant for most variant calling methods across
the various sequencing depths.

The single-sample variant calling methods (S-GATK,
S-SAMtools, S-VarScan and glfSingle) were found to have
better sensitivity in correctly detecting the variant sites than if
used as multi-sample methods across all different minor allele
frequency spectrums considered, though their differences de-
crease with increasing sequencing depths (Fig. lA, Supplemen-
tary Fig. S5A and Supplementary Tables SliSS). However, for
each sequencing coverage depth considered, the differences be-
tween the single—sample and multi-sample modes for each variant
method increases after filtering is applied. At 5x coverage, the
differences in sensitivity between S-GATK and GATK are 0.4
and 1.6% for raw and ﬁltered, respectively. This trend can also
be observed in SAMtools, VarScan and glfTools, though the
differences are not as large as GATK. Therefore, the effects of
ﬁltering contribute signiﬁcantly to the differences observed be-
tween the methods for sensitivity of ﬁltered loci detected particu-
larly for GATK at 5x coverage. For most variant calling

Fig. 1. Comparison of the sensitivity of GATK and SAMtools (single-
sample mode, multi with 96 SSMP samples and multi combining 96
SSMP samples with 1092 1 KGP Phase 1 samples), and CASAVA
across various sequencing coverage depths for ﬁltered sites of (A) all
polymorphic loci; (B) common frequency variant loci; (C) low frequency
variant loci; (D) rare frequency variant loci across 96 SSMP samples
identiﬁed on chromosome 20 of the Omnil-Quad array. Sensitivity
values for lkgp-GATK and lkgp-SAMtools at 10 and 20x are interpo-
lated between 5 and 30x

methods, the differences in sensitivity between the rare and fil-
tered sites at 5x coverage depth can be primarily attributed
to the rare variants determination, where, for example, in
SOAPsnp, the differences are 1.3, 24.3 and 48.6% for
common, low and rare frequency variant loci identiﬁcation, re-
spectively (Supplementary Tables S27S4). However, in GATK,
the differences are almost similar across the frequency spectrum,
and thus the effects of filtering in GATK are not biased toward
any frequency spectrum.

The observation that single-sample variant calling methods
have higher sensitivity than their multi-sample mode at low
sequencing coverage depths, particularly at 5x seem counter-
intuitive. However, if the 96 SSMP samples are called together
with the low coverage 1092 samples from the 1000 Genomes
Project, the sensitivity achieved by these multi-sample callers
(lkgp-GATK and lkgp-SAMtools) are comparable with the
single-sample variant callers across all frequency spectrums as-
sessed, and are in fact much higher with ~20% improved
sensitivity for the rare frequency variants at 5x coverage
(Fig. 1D and Supplementary Table S4). At 5x coverage, sen-
sitivity for lkgp-GATK and lkgp-SAMtools is the highest
among the callers compared for all polymorphic raw variants,
while ﬁltering does slightly lower the sensitivity for common
variants, but for low and rare variants, the sensitivity is still
much higher than the other callers. For high sequencing cover-
age depths of 30x, almost all of the variant callers achieve
>99% sensitivity.

When we compared the false-positive measures between the
different variant calling methods in erroneously determining a
reference site to be a variant locus (Fig. 2 and Supplementary
Tables S6 and S7), we observed that by increasing the sequencing
coverage depths, the false positives generally decrease for most
methods, with GATK having the lowest value at all depths

Fig. 2. Comparison of the false positives of variant calling methods in
erroneously determining a reference site to be a variant locus across vari-
ous sequencing coverage depths for the ﬁltered loci on chromosome 20 of
the Omnil-Quad array. False-positive values for lkgp-GATK and lkgp-
SAMtools at 10 and 20x are interpolated between 5 and 30x

considered. At 5x coverage, the false positives for l kgp-
GATK is, however, much higher than that of GATK, while
values for lkgp-SAMtools and SAMtools are comparable.
However, the differences in false positives between raw and ﬁl-
tered variants are significantly higher for lkgp-GATK, GATK
and SOAPsnp than the other methods, suggesting that the vari-
ant ﬁltering for GATK and SOAPsnp while reducing the false
positives signiﬁcantly also substantially reduces its sensitivity.

3.2 Impact of ﬁltering on variant detection

Variant ﬁlters are an inherent, but important, procedure in the
variant calling methods, as it serves to reduce the number of false
positives while optimally retaining the true variants. The ﬁltering
procedures range from simple thresholds on quality scores to
sophisticated machine learning methods that separate true vari-
ants from sequencing artifacts. We thus attempted to study the
effectiveness of the ﬁltering procedure used by the different vari-
ant calling methods by measuring the ratio of decrease in sensi-
tivity against the decrease in discordance after filtering (Table 2).
An effective filter should thus have low values, preferably below
1, as it means the ﬁlter applied has removed substantially more
false positives than true variants.

Generally, for each variant calling method, as the sequencing
coverage depth increases, the rates decrease, which implies
greater conﬁdence and ability of each method in distinguishing
between true variant loci and sequencing artifacts. At 5x cover-
age depth, ﬁlters applied in SAMtools and CASAVA are unable
to differentiate between true variants from false positives, and
thus a signiﬁcant portion of true variant loci are filtered together
with the discordant calls. Interestingly for GATK, the ratios are
all below one, thus suggesting that across $30x coverage
depths, the sophisticated filtering process of VQSR had removed
more discordant or artifacts than true variant calls. Thus, at 5x
coverage depth, VQSR applied in GATK was most efﬁcient at
differentiating between true variants and artifacts, while at 30x
coverage, a simple Q20 ﬁlter on the quality threshold was
sufﬁcient.

96 SSMP multi-sample and 96 SSMP with 1092 1 KGP multi-sample
variant calling conﬁgurations

3.3 Impact of alignment on variant calling

Although the sensitivity of S-GATK and GATK is almost similar,
the total number of variant sites detected by both methods differs
substantially such that almost half of the sites identiﬁed in S-
GATK are unique (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S6).
Assuming the widely accepted genome-wide Ts/Tv ratio of
2.(L2.4 is also applicable for chromosome 20, we ﬁnd that
almost all of known Ts/Tv ratios at all sequencing coverage
depths for almost all variant callers are within the range.
However, at 5 and 30x, the Ts/Tv ratios for novel sites differ sig-
niﬁcantly for S-GATK, while the values for GATK, S-SAMtools
and SAMtools are within the range (Supplementary Table S8). To
investigate further, we used a different alignment software BWA-
MEM with default parameters (Li et al., 2013), while applying the
same processing steps for variant calling at 5 and 30x for both
single- and multi-sample modes. The number of variant loci iden-
tiﬁed in S-GATK at both 5 and 30x reduced signiﬁcantly and
showed a much greater overlap between GATK in multi-sample
mode (Fig. 3) and in addition the novel Ts/Tv ratios are now much
closer or within the acceptable range (Supplementary Table S8).
Therefore, good read alignments are fundamental in the variant
calling process (Ruffalo et al., 2011), and the combinations of
aligners and variant callers are similarly essential in both sensitivity
and speciﬁcity of the variant calling process.

3.4 Assessing genotype concordance

30x sequencing coverage, the minimum and maximum genotype
concordance are achieved by VarScan and GATK at 99.79 and
99.98%. In general, all variant calling methods are able to pro-
duce the correct genotype calls once a variant site is correctly
determined, and the higher sequencing coverage depths do result
in better genotype calls and with only marginal increase beyond
20x coverage depth. Comparatively, GATK has the highest
genotype concordance rates among all methods across the vari-
ous sequencing coverage depths (Fig. 4 and Supplementary
Fig. S7).

3.5 Assessing the variant accuracy

Aggregating variant sensitivity and genotype concordance into a
single variant accuracy measure, we observe similar trends (Fig. 5
and Supplementary Fig. S8) where variant accuracy increases as
sequencing coverage depths increase, and after 20x coverage, the
additional gains in accuracy are minimal for all methods con-
sidered. At 5x coverage depth, the multi-sample methods of
GATK, SAMtools and glﬁVlultiples outperform the rest of the
variant callers, with lkgp-GATK and lkgp-SAMtools having
the highest variant accuracy. However, at 20x and beyond,
there does not seem to have additional advantages in pooling
of information across the samples for most methods, where at
30x coverage depth, the most accurate variant callers are
glfSingle, S-GLF and CASAVA. Although glfSingle seems to
be the best variant caller method, as it has among the methods,
one of the highest accuracy across the sequencing coverage
depths, it also unfortunately has a much higher false discovery
rate than compared with the other methods, where it is ~1%
higher than CASAVA at both 5 and 30x, while the false discov-
ery rate for CASAVA remains at low constant across the cover-
age depths.

Fig. 5. Comparison of the accuracy of variant calling methods across
various sequencing coverage depths for variants (ﬁltered) on chromosome
20 of the Omnil-Quad array. Accuracy values for lkgp-GATK and
lkgp-SAMtools at 10 and 20x are interpolated between 5 and 30x

4 DISCUSSION

In this article, we compared the sensitivity of variant site detec-
tion, genotype calls concordance and an overall measure of vari-
ant accuracy across six commonly used variant calling methods
of (i) GATK; (ii) SAMtools; (iii) CASAVA; (iv) VarScan; (v)
glfTools; and (vi) SOAPsnp at various sequencing coverage
depths of 5730x. First, our ﬁndings indicate that increasing
the sequencing coverage depth will ultimately improve both the
sensitivity and accuracy of variant genotype calls for all variant
calling methods. However, it is probably still not economically
feasible to perform deep whole-genome sequencing for a large
number of individuals for various studies of human traits and
diseases. For individuals who are sequenced at low coverage
depths averaging 4e6x such as in 1 KGP, the multi-sample
method of variant calling such as GATK and SAMtools which
aggregate information across multiple samples in correctly de-
tecting variant sites with low false discovery rate and generate
accurate genotype calls should be used. An even better approach
would be to include the large number of samples in 1 KGP,
together with the sequenced individuals in the study for multi-
sample calling. If the sequencing depth per sample can be
increased to at least 30x, then the single-sample method of
CASAVA, which is the default variant caller in Illumina’s pipe-
line, seems much better at distinguishing between sequencing
errors from true polymorphisms present in the samples than
the multi-sample methods. We also caution that stricter ﬁlters,
rather than the default recommended, should be applied to
reduce the number of false positives if GATK and/or
SAMtools are used in the single-sample mode of variant calling.
If possible, multiple samples should be called together using
GATK and/or SAMtools to take advantage of the strengths of
these methods. In addition for GATK, it is also probably advis-
able to use BWA for reads mapping.

We have relied on the accuracy of the genotypes obtained
from Omnil-Quad array to assess the performance of the differ-
ent variant calling methods. This is obviously imperfect, as geno-
type calling algorithms for microarrays tend to be unreliable at
SNPs with low minor allele counts, even if Illumina’s proprietary

SNP genotype-calling software GenCall for the Illumina micro-
arrays has been reported to exhibit low error rates (Shah et al.,
2012). However, in our comparison, any errors in the Omni1-
Quad genotypes will contribute the same impact to the compari-
son of the different variant callers. Not all polymorphisms
present on chromosomes 1 and 20 for these 96 SSMP individuals
are known and compared. However as non-overlapping sets of
variant calls are made by the different variant calling methods,
relying on the accuracy of Omnil-Quad array genotypes would
be the best and unbiased option. A small number of these SSMP
individuals have also been genotyped on the Illumina Omni2.5M
array, and common SNPs present on both arrays were checked
for concordance. We did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant differences in
genotype calls made between the two platforms that have altered
the trends observed in our conclusions.

In our assessment of variant calling methods, we have not
considered variant calling methods that are designed to take
advantage of multi-sample linkage disequilibrium (LD) such as
GATK + BEAGLE (Browning and Yu, 2009). The primary aim
of these LD-based methods is to generate accurate genotype calls
by grouping individuals who are carrying similar haplotypes,
which we believe will only beneﬁt speciﬁc populations with
shorter LD ranges, and might not be generally applicable.

With more WGS-based studies being conducted, we believe
there is still need for further active research into accurate variant
detection and genotype calling from massive sequence reads from
next-generation sequencing platforms, including for insertions
and deletions (indels) and structural variants in addition to
SNPs. Publicly available resources such as the SSMP database
and other population-level deep whole-genome sequencing will
be valuable both for the design and evaluation of variant calling
methods, as such data will present a more accurate reﬂection of
the variants that are present within each sample.

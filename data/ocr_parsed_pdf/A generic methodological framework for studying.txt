Abstract

Motivation: Motility is a fundamental cellular attribute, which plays a major part in processes rang—
ing from embryonic development to metastasis. Traditionally, single cell motility is often studied
by live cell imaging. Yet, such studies were so far limited to low throughput. To systematically
study cell motility at a large scale, we need robust methods to quantify cell trajectories in live cell
imaging data.

Results: The primary contribution of this article is to present Motility study Integrated Workflow
(Moth), a generic workflow for the study of single cell motility in high—throughput time—lapse
screening data. It is composed of cell tracking, cell trajectory mapping to an original feature space
and hit detection according to a new statistical procedure. We show that this workflow is scalable
and demonstrates its power by application to simulated data, as well as large—scale live cell imag—
ing data. This application enables the identification of an ontology of cell motility patterns in a fully

 

unsupervised manner.

1 Introduction

High—throughput (HT) microscopy and high content screening
(HCS) are state—of—the—art approaches to investigate many aspects of
cellular organization and function, such as protein localization
(Glory and Murphy, 2007), spatial transcriptomics (Battich et (11.,
2013) or drug screening (Perlman et (11., 2004).

In particular, when combined with a loss—of—function strategy,
these approaches are now widely used to study the molecular basis
of biological processes by monitoring the phenotypic consequences
of downregulation or overexpression of genes of interest (Pepperkok
and Ellenberg, 2006). When performed at a large and ideally gen—
ome—wide scale, such screening approaches have become indispens—
able tools for functional genomics: they have the potential to
provide us with a close to complete picture of the proteins involved
in the process under study.

Indeed, many large—scale phenotypic screens have been published
previously, shedding light on the regulation of such diverse cellular
processes as protein secretion (Simpson et (11., 2012), endocytosis
(Collinet et (11., 2010) or cell division (Neumann et (11., 2010). Such
screens do not only provide lists of candidate genes for further fol—
low—up studies and for computational modeling approaches, they
also generate large image databases. Those can turn out to be a pre—
cious scientific resource—as a collection of experimental data for
punctual queries or as a basis for systematic and potentially integra—
tive computational analysis. Although it has always been a strength
in bioinformatics to rely on rich publicly available data sources, the
use and re—use of image data is not straightforward. On the one
hand, this is due to the lack of standardized data formats (Sommer
et (11., 2013) and ontologies (Hoehndorf et (11., 2012). On the other
hand, the computational tools which are necessary to perform such

analyses are often not available. As a consequence, studies based on
remining existing phenotypic screens have only recently started to
appear (Ostaszewski et (11., 2012; Pau et (11., 2013; Suratanee et (11.,
2014). We hypothesize that remining these rich phenotypic re—
sources can help to increase our understanding of many basic cellu—
lar functions, such as cell motility.

Cell motility plays a key role in many physiological processes
including embryonic development or immune response (Friedl and
Weigelin, 2008), and is also involved in pathological processes such
as fibrosis and metastasis. The latter is dependent on the ability of
cancer cells to migrate, both as single cells and collectively
(Decaestecker et (11., 2007; Yilmaz and Christofori, 2010).

Many in vitro assays have been specifically designed to study cell
motility (Decaestecker et (11., 2007; Kramer et (11., 2013). Examples
include semi—automated analysis of single cell traces on bead—coated
layers (Naffar—Abu—Amara et (11., 2008) and wound healing assays
measuring collective cell migration (Simpson et (11., 2008).

However, single cell motility studies on live cell imaging data
have so far been limited to low—to—medium (Lara et al. 2011)
throughput. There are two bottlenecks that currently explain the
non—existence of such studies in an HT setup: acquiring large—scale
data is expensive, and the relevant computational tools are often ei—
ther non—existent or not easily scalable.

The contribution of this article is to present MotIW (Motility
study Integrated Workﬂow), and its application to motility gene dis—
covery. A generic methodological framework, MotIW enables to
quantitatively study cell motility at single cell resolution in HT time—
lapse data in an unsupervised way. It consists of cell tracking, cell
trajectory mapping to an original feature space and outlier experi—
ment detection according to a new statistical procedure (Fig. 1). We
show the power of our method by applying MotIW to simulated
data, which allows us to estimate recall and precision to be expected
on real data. We then apply this workﬂow to a previously published
genome—wide screen by RNA interference (RNAi) and live cell imag—
ing, the Mitocheck dataset. Analysis of the screening data reveals
the existence of a cell trajectory ontology in the dataset. Without
any prior assumption on cell motion, we are able to identify eight
types of cell trajectories.

The remainder of this article is organized as follows: after a short
description of the data and the implementation details in Section 2,
we detail MotIW in Sections 3.1—3.3, as well as its application to
simulated data in Section 3.4 and the Mitocheck screen in Section 3.5.
Section 4 brieﬂy discusses broader perspectives of this workﬂow.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 A genome—wide time—resolved dataset

We used a previously published genome—wide dataset of time—
resolved records of cellular phenotype responses to gene silencing,
which were generated for virtually all protein—coding genes
(Neumann et (11., 2010). It is publicly available at mitocheck.org.

For this, arrays of transfection cocktails containing small inter—
fering RNAs (siRNAs) were spotted directly in live cell—imaging
chambers in a 384 format. HeLa cells stably expressing the core his—
tone 2B tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) were seeded on
top of the arrays, and imaged 18h after the transfection for 48h
with a time lapse of 30min (Plan10x, NA 0.4; Olympus). Each
microarray contained 8 negative controls (scrambled: not targeting
any gene) and 12 positive controls showing different phenotypes. A
total of 22 612 protein—coding genes have been targeted by at least 2
siRNAs each, in total 51 767 siRNAs. For each siRNA, there are
data from at least 3 technical replicates, which created 182 191
quality controlled time—lapse experiments in total. Because of up—
dates in the genome annotation, some reagents could not be mapped
to the current ENSEMBL version. In total, the dataset contains data
for 17 816 protein—coding genes in144 909 quality controlled time—
lapse experiments.

2.2 Software

We use CellCognition (Held et (11., 2010) (cellcognition.org) for
segmentation and feature extraction and CPlex (http://www—01.ibm.
com/software/commerce/optimization/cplex—optimizer/) for opti—
mization in the tracking procedure. To store, manage and access the
screening data, we use a previously published data format CellH5
(Sommer et (11., 2013). All scripts are written in the programming
language Python 2.7 using SciPy (Jones et al. 2001) and NumPy,
and all plots were generated by matplotlib (Hunter 2007).

3 Results

In this section, we present MotIW, our workﬂow for the automatic
and quantitative analysis of single cell motility in video sets from
time—lapse microscopy—based screens. Figure 1 summarizes its differ—
ent steps. Brieﬂy, for each video nuclei are segmented and features
are extracted as published previously (Held et (11., 2010; Walter
et (11., 2010). Cells are tracked using a new machine learning—based
tracking procedure, described in Section 3.1. The trajectories are
then mapped to a feature space described in Section 3.2. Presented
in Section 3.3, an original statistical procedure then enables the de—
tection of experiments in which single cell motility is significantly
different than that in control movies. Finally, Section 3.4 describes
the simulation of trajectories which allows us to validate the per—
formance of the workﬂow.

3.1 Cell tracking

There exist two main approaches to cell tracking. The deformable
model approach relies on identifying and modeling objects on the
first frame, and linking them to objects in consecutive frame by
updating the models (Zimmer et (11., 2002). On the other hand, the
object association approach associates preidentified objects in con—
secutive frames (Lou and Hamprecht, 2011).

Different datasets usually require different object identification
approaches. For the sake of modularity, we therefore prefer to keep
segmentation and tracking steps independent.

Cell tracking faces several challenges in videos from high content
screens like Mitocheck, including high population density in each
picture, high phenotypic inter—cell variability and possibly low time
resolution between successive images (30 min). Furthermore, the
algorithm has to handle apparitions, disparitions, divisions and
fusions (this event results from occlusion or segmentation errors).
Finally, to be applicable in a screening context, we cannot a priori
model cell motion, as such hypotheses are bound to break in the
presence of phenotypes. Indeed, the impact of chemical exposure on
cell motion is not known. To also avoid dependence on manual par—
ameter tuning, we have extended a non—parametric structured learn—
ing approach from Lou and Hamprecht (201 1).

We first characterize each cell in each image by a set of 230
object features including geometric, shape and texture features
(Held et al., 2010; Walter et al., 2010). The goal of cell tracking in
this approach is to match cells in successive images, by assigning
them the most likely instant temporal behavior in the set E : {move,
appear, disappear, split in 2 or 3, merge at 2 or 3}. All possible
matches between cells in consecutive frames are exhaustively con—
sidered, subject to distance thresholding. Match features are the
following:

' the absolute difference in object features if the event is move,
split, merge, the object features otherwise

' the geometrical distance between object at time t, Dbl-Lt, and
object at time t+ 1, Dbl-“+1, if the event is move, split, merge,
the minimal distance to the image border otherwise

' the maximal angle between 00/3, and the elements of Chg-7,11, if
the event is a split

' the angle between the main axis of 00/3, and Chg-1,11 weighted
by their average eccentricity, if the event is a move

The optimal object matching 2(t) comes down to bi—partite
graph matching: it is solved by maximizing a likelihood function L
which depends on the weights w of match features and the match
features  subject to the constraint that all objects are matched in
both frames [cf Equation (1 )].

The weights w are learned by a support vector machine using
annotated trajectories, following the formulation of Lou and
Hamprecht (2011). The likelihood maximization, an integer linear
programing (ILP) problem, is solved by IBM Cplex.

The extension compared with Lou and Hamprecht (2011) lies in
the choice of match features. We also implemented a more efficient
computation of match hypotheses using kd—trees. Furthermore, we
enabled the tracking model to learn from partial annotations of dif—
ferent experiments. (However, this is not learning from partial anno—
tations in the sense of Lou and Hamprecht (2012). Indeed, in our

implementation of Lou and Hamprecht (2011), the user chooses a
subset of cells which has to be annotated on all movie frames. In
Lou and Hamprecht (2012), the user can choose both a subset of
movie frames and a subset of cells (s)he wishes to annotate on those
frames.) This permits the user to integrate examples from both con—
trol and non—control experiments in the training set, which is crucial
to guarantee that the model can efficiently track cells in all condi—
tions. We also added three object division and fusion to E. This is
important in a screening context, where aberrant cell divisions may
occur. In the future, it could be interesting to couple object segmen—
tation and tracking to correct for missing detections.

To validate MotIW’s cell tracking procedure, we compare it
with CellCognition’s constrained nearest—neighbor (CNN) tracking
algorithm, and with Jaqaman et al. (2008) as implemented in
CellProfiler (Carpenter et al., 2006). The latter approach views
tracking as a linear assignment problem (LAP) and uses user—defined
costs for performing merges, splits, appearances and disappearances.
We have chosen these two approaches for benchmarking, as they
are available in popular High Content Screening software.

Our training set consists of ~32 000 matches, among which
0.5% appear, 0.5% disappear, 1% merge and 2% split. They come
from the Mitocheck dataset. Furthermore, they were taken from
both control experiments and phenotypic experiments according to
Neumann et al. (2010) in order to ensure that the algorithm also
works in the presence of phenotypes. The training set was annotated
using CellCognition’s CNN tracking algorithm followed by manual
correction. As shown in Table 1, MotIW outperforms the other two
methods as measured by the average accuracy on the five movement
types. As can be seen in Figure 2, they show similar performances on
move events and have therefore similar overall (pooled) accuracies.
The contribution of the learning approach is most important for the
other events, such as cell division, when object matching is less
trivial.

3.2 Trajectory features

Once cell trajectories are captured, each trajectory is described by a
set of 15 features. These features were partly taken from previous
publications on quantitative motility analysis, partly newly
designed.

Robust and precise features are needed to account for the partial
stochasticity of cell migratory behavior. We use three types of fea—
tures, as detailed in Table 2. Prior to that, trajectories resulting from
object fusion and trajectories which are shorter than 10 frames are
discarded. This trajectory quality control ensures that cell clusters
are not considered, and increases the dataset robustness.

3.2.1 Particle motion features

This group of features encompasses the diffusion coefficient and the
movement type, which were in the first place used to study particle
motion (see Ferrari et al., 2001; and one of its applications to single
particle motion in Biology—Sbalzarini and Koumoutsakos, 2005).

Let us note < dp > the moment of order p of a particle or a
group of particles. For large t, it is proportionate to W for most
dispersive processes (Ferrari et al., 2001). Assuming that VI, is pro—
portionate to p (i.e. the particle movement is strongly self—similar),
the constant y : yp / p (hereafter the particle’s Movement type) quan—
tifies how directed the particle motion is. If y is equal to 1, the
movement is perfectly directed, whereas if y is equal to 0.5, it is per—
fectly diffusive. Between 0.5 and 1, the movement is super—diffusive,
whereas below 0.5 it is called sub—diffusive.

Furthermore, assuming y : 0.5, the constant linking < d2 > [i.e.
the mean squared displacement (MSD)] and t can be computed—it
is the Diffusion coefficient. The Diffusion adequation is the correl—
ation coefficient between < d2 > and t, hence measuring how well
the diffusive model applies to the track at hand.

We have furthermore created two new features to characterize
the alternance between periods of diffusive motion and periods of
directed motion—the track entropy and the englobing ball number.

It has been observed that cell motion in 2D alternates between
diffusive and directed motions (in the absence of any perturbation
or chemical gradient). The feature track Entropy was designed to
measure how the time sequence of 2D cell positions m, : (xhyt)

distributes in balls of radius r (see also Figure 3). This feature is cal—

3. Compute the track Entropy according to the following formula:

The track Entropy measures the entropy of the distribution of
track positions in balls of radius r. To deal with cells whose trajecto—
ries are concentrated in space, but were not concentrated in time,
the constraint is imposed that these balls shall contain only consecu—
tive positions in time.

The englobing Ball number is the number of balls of radius r
that contain all track positions. It is normalized by the square root
of T to be independent of the track time length T.

Different radii may be relevant for different data (depending on,
e.g. the experiment time lapse, the pixel size or the cell type). We
chose to use two different radii, r1 and r; with r1 < r2, to incorporate
information about cell trajectories on two different time scales. r1
and r2 were manually chosen, such that for the Mitocheck dataset,
the corresponding features are neither constant nor too correlated.
They respectively correspond to ~2.5 and 12 pm. In the following,
the features Entropy i and Ball number i correspond to radius r,-.

3.2.2 Other global features

This group of features encompasses further global descriptors of the
cell trajectory, such as the track Convex hull area (normalized by
the square root of its time length) or the cell Largest move on its tra—
jectory. It also contains the average Track curvature, which we de—
signed as follows for each trajectory: for each position t, an
orthogonal regression is performed on {(x,.y,-))i E {t.  .t+ A,}}
using orthogonal distance regression (A, : 10). The mean curvature
of the trajectory is the average of all regression sums of squares.

3.2.3 Averaged local features
Finally, two features are averaged local features, which are the cell
MSD and its Mean signed turning angle.

3.2.4 Feature set evaluation

Track time length is an irrelevant random variable for studying sin—
gle cell motility, which could bias some features. Therefore, we
ensured that they are not significantly correlated with this param—
eter: the correlation between track time lengths and features is max—
imal for the Effective space lengtb, where it is equal to ~30% (on a
subset of the Mitocheck dataset, data not shown).

Figure 4 shows the correlation matrix for the extracted features.
One group of highly correlated features is visible in the bottom left
corner of the heatmap, which encompasses speed—related features.
The existence of two feature subgroups within this group can be ex—
plained by the following observation: the first group of features,
from Ball number 1 to MSD, is linked to cell instantaneous displace—
ments, whereas the second group, from Effective speed to Entropy
2, is linked to its displacements on the whole trajectory.

The other correlations can as well be explained by feature defin—
itions. As an example, the anti—correlation between Mean signed
turning angle and Movement type can be interpreted as follows: a
low signed turning angle is indicative of correlated motion, which is
super—diffusive and translates into a high Movement type.

Figure 4 indicates that there are less degrees of freedom than fea—
tures, which was verified by a principal component analysis (PCA).
On the same trajectory subset, ~95 % of the variance is explained by
the first seven principal components.

3.3 Statistical procedure

HT screening data are organized in batches of experiments which
have been performed simultaneously. Each batch includes a set of
negative controls, that is, conditions where no effect is expected.
Because of a non—negligible batch effect, an experiment can only be
compared with controls of the same batch in most of the cases.

Let us consider an experiment i. Following trajectory feature ex—
traction, it can be summarized as a set of (9 feature distributions
((9 : 15). The comparison of these distributions with those of
controls from the same batch B,, using Kolmogorov—Smirnov two—
sample test, provides a list of p values (pg)0:1m®.

A final statistic S,- combining the p values of all features is ob—
tained by Fisher’s formula:

3.- : —22 171070) (3)
6

As shown in Figure 4, the features are not independent.
Therefore, the distribution of this statistic under the null hypothesis
does not follow a chi—squared law with 28 degrees of freedom. To
assess which values of this statistic should be considered as indica—
tive of altered motility, a sample of the distribution of S under the
null hypothesis is then computed by comparing the control experi—
ments which were not used in the experiment—control comparisons,
with the other controls from the same batch.

In the absence of an explicit form for the null distribution, this
sample allows to quantify the intra—batch variations of single cell

motility features. The variations can be due to technical artifacts or
biological variability. Then, the comparison of the distribution of S
statistics obtained from control—experiment comparisons, to the dis—
tribution obtained from control—control comparisons, permits the
computation of empirical p values. This enables the detection of hit
experiments with regard to single cell motility. False discoveries are
controlled using the Benjamini—Hochberg procedure (Benjamini and
Yekutieli, 2001). This procedure is repeated n times to ensure that
the final p value of an experiment i does not depend on the choice of
a specific subset of control experiments in its batch. Here is its for—
malized description:

1. Compute a sample of statistic (3) under null hypothesis from con-
trol-control comparisons.

For each batch b,

For k in {1, .. . ,Cb(C;, — 1)/2}, where C5 is the number of controls
of batch b that passed the quality control

a. Randomly split the control experiments in two groups A1,”),
of cardinal 2, and BM, of cardinal Cb — 2

b. For each control / of AM, compute the statistic S2717 ,- (3) by
comparing it with the pooled group of controls BM,

2. Compute statistics from experiment—control comparisons. For
computation time feasibility, only n : 5 repetitions corresponding
to n splits of the controls set (AM. B hire) are selected on each batch
for experiment—control comparisons.

a. For each repetition k in {1, . .. ,n}:
For each experiment i belonging to a batch b, compute the
statistic Sim-(3) by comparing it with the pooled group of con—
trols B bﬁk

b. Combine distinct iterations: To be conservative, we chose
the following approach:

5,- : s ,- 4
33% b ( l

3. For each experiment i, compute the p value p,-:

I 7 max card({(b. [2.018211]. 2 s,}) 1
p‘ _ card({(brkri)}) ’Card({(brkri)})

 

4. For each experiment i, compute the adjusted p value p,- to control
the false discovery rate (Benjamini—Hochberg procedure;
Benjamini and Yekutieli, 2001)

3.4 Validation on a simulated screen

3.4.1 Screen simulation

To evaluate the performance of our workﬂow on data for which the
ground truth is known, we designed a process to simulate an HT
screening experiment.

In a first step, five types of single cell movements were designed,
in agreement with qualitative observations from the dataset: ran-
dom, fast random, curbed directed, flip directed and stop-and—go
(Fig.5).

Let (dt. (12,) be the polar coordinates of the difference vector mt_1
—mt of any two consecutive points. For random movement, (12, is
chosen at random and the distance d, : Hm, —mt_1))2 is drawn
from a normal distribution, whose parameters are estimated from
the data. The same holds for fast random with increased distance d,.
For the curbed-directed movement type, d, follows again a normal
distribution as for random movement, but the angle is calculated as
(1;, + e with (1), : pH + Ad)” where A¢>t and 5 follow normal distri—
butions, whose parameters are set manually to visually match some
observed trajectories.

Fig. 5. Simulated trajectories: stop-and-go (green), flip directed (red), random (orange), fast random (purple) and curbed directed (blue)

Flip directed and stop-and—go are two composite types of move—
ment, where the cells alternate between different states. The dwell—
ing times in the two states are random integers with manually fixed
ranges (which can be different for the two states) and are drawn
independently for each trajectory. Flip-directed movement corres—
ponds to directed movement ((1), is drawn from a normal distribu—
tion) with a 180° ﬂip for every state transition. Finally, stop-and—go
movement alternates between slow random movement (where (12, is
drawn from a uniform distribution) and fast—directed movement
(where (12, is drawn from a normal distribution).

In a second step, we want to simulate movies (controls and ex—
periments), that is, sets of trajectories. For this, we define five movie
types with different proportions of single cell movement types
(cf supra). Normal movies account both for control movies and
experiments in which cell motility is similar to that of controls.

They contain on average 80% of random trajectories, and a mix of
the four other trajectory types. This reflects our observation that in
real data, experiments and controls typically contain all possible
types of cell trajectories and that phenotypes are characterized in
a shift in percentage. All other movie types contain (on average)
5 0—65 % random trajectories, the rest being completed according to
the movie type. For example, movie type fast is composed of 30% of
fast random trajectories, 60% of random trajectories and a mix of
the three other trajectory types.

The total number of trajectories in each movie was drawn at ran—
dom from real data in the following way: first, a batch is randomly
chosen in the dataset. Then, we assign a permutation of the real tra—
jectory numbers from the experiments of the picked batch to the
simulated positions. In this way, we can include potential batch ef—
fects in our simulated data. The number of trajectories of each

movement type in each movie is drawn from the corresponding
movie type multinomial distribution, where the percentages were
defined as described above.

The third step was the simulation of ~50 000 experimental con—
ditions, which were distributed on 130 plates, and performed in trip—
licate as in Mitocheck experimental setup (Neumann et al., 2010).
For the sake of simplicity, triplicates were supposed to belong to the
same movie type. On each plate, between 5% and 15% of the ex—
periments were selected to be other than normal movies.

3.4.2 Application to a simulated screen
Our workﬂow successfully recognized more than 98% of the experi—
ments, as detailed in Table 3.

Our simulation pipeline was also used to estimate how useful the
trajectory feature set is to capture the differences between different
types of trajectory motion. A total of 500 samples of each trajectory
type were simulated, and their features extracted. A PCA was per—
formed, after which we retained the eighth first principal compo—
nents, which explain ~95 % of the dataset variance. Finally, k—
means was applied to the dataset with k : 5.

Many simulation parameters (e.g. each track length) are chosen
at random, and k—means’ results depend on its initialization: the pro—
cedure was therefore repeated 10 times. The results are presented in
Table 3. Although distinguishing trajectory types is subject to some
errors, it shows that the whole pipeline is robust enough to identify
experiments in which cell motility is significantly different. A rea—
sonable accuracy in terms of trajectory types is also obtained.

3.5 Application to the Mitocheck dataset

After evaluating MotIW on simulated data, we then apply it to the
whole genome—wide screen Mitocheck (Neumann et al., 2010),
which enables us to identify an ontology of 2D cell trajectories.

In the context of the Mitocheck dataset, the identification of an
experiment in which cell motility is significantly different from nega—
tive controls leads to the identification of genes which might be
involved in its mechanisms.

The application of MotIW to the Mitocheck dataset enabled the
identification of the experiments which significantly deviate from
controls (5%; 7 153 of 144 909). It amounts to 1 180 genes (out of
17 816), some of which are known to be involved in cellular motil—
ity, such as RhoA (Ras homolog family, member A) or CDK5 (cyc—
lin—dependent kinase 5).

A related question to motility gene discovery is to know whether
there exists an ontology of cell trajectories. The approach would be
to apply unsupervised clustering methods on the whole trajectory
dataset and try to identify a number of motility patterns for which
the clustering is of good quality. This is measured by cluster quality
indices, which depend on the clustering method (Tan et al., 2005,
Chapter 8; Halkidi et al. 2001). As an example, two common indi—
ces to evaluate the output of k—means are the intra—cluster cohesion
C(k) and the silhouette score S(k). They both compare intra—cluster
distances with inter—cluster distances. A slope change in C(k) and a
maximum in S(k) are expected at the appropriate number of clus—
ters, if it exists.

This approach did not prove to be successful when applied to
pooled trajectories from all experiments, for a wide range of cluster—
ing techniques (k—means, Gaussian mixtures models, spectral cluster—
ing, fuzzy c—means, kernel k—means—data not shown). It succeeded
when all trajectories from the detected experiments were pooled to—
gether. Indeed, this small subset contains only experiments which
have been selected for being significantly different of controls in
terms of single cell motility: it is enriched in rare trajectories. After
retaining the first seven principal components (explaining 95% of
the variance), k—means was applied to the resulting dataset of ~1.1
million trajectories.

Figure 6 shows the evolution of intra—cluster cohesion and sil—
houette score with respect to the number of clusters. It points to
k: 8 as being both the best and a good quality clustering on this
dataset. Indeed, a break and a maximum are respectively expected
in the cluster cohesion and the silhouette score curves at the correct
cluster number, if it exists. The cluster characteristics are detailed in
Figure 7. Each column in the heatmap corresponds to one cell trajec—
tory, for which the rows show the standard scores of a subset of
features.

In the first place, it shows that single cell information can be
retrieved by our statistical procedure, which works at the experi—
ment level. Indeed, a result about single cell motility patterns is ob—
tained from experiments which were selected on the basis of their
trajectory feature distributions.

In the second place, it shows that there is more than speed for
differentiating trajectory types. For example, clusters 2 and 3 pre—
sent very similar MSDs and Effective space lengtb. However, trajec—
tory curvatures are different: the features Mean curvature and
Straigbtness index are quite distinct between the two clusters. This
can be observed in the Supplementary movie, where cells whose tra—
jectory belongs to cluster 2 (green) are much straighter than those
belonging to cluster 3 (red). In this video, cells whose trajectory
passed the trajectory quality control have a dot, whose color corres—
ponds to its cluster as indicated in Figure 7.

4 Discussion

This article presents a generic methodological framework for study—
ing single cell motility in a HT setup. It combines single cell track—
ing, newly designed trajectory features and an original statistical
procedure. Furthermore, its output could be used to obtain an ontol—
ogy of cell motility in an unsupervised manner: cell motion types
were inferred from the data without using any prior knowledge. We
found that clustering procedures might not scale in the presence of
great biological variability, as is typically observed in HT datasets.
We suspect that this is due to highly unbalanced classes and large
biological variability. Taken together, those effects produce continu—
ous looking datasets. However, applying hit detection with the
described statistical procedure prior to clustering solved the problem
for our trajectory analysis. It may be a promising procedure to apply
to other clustering problems in HCS, such as clustering of nuclear or
cellular morphologies.

As cell population migration during metastasis are thought to be
led by some leader cell, it is crucial to study single cell motility. The
workﬂow we have presented in this article allows to quantify single
cell trajectories. Therefore its application to large—scale datasets will
provide useful insights into the molecular regulation of single cell
motility, thereby complementing previous studies on collective cell
migration.

The application of this workﬂow is not limited to RNAi data. In
a next step, we are going to apply this workﬂow to newly generated

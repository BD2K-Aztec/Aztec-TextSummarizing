Starting with IsoRank (Singh et al., 2008), several global net—
work algorithms using more or less similar deﬁnitions have
been suggested. IsoRank is based on an eigenvalue formulation
of local neighborhood alignments. PATH and GA of Zaslavskiy
et al. (2009) are based on appropriate relaxations of a cost for—
mulation over the set of doubly stochastic matrices. PISwap uses
a greedy heuristic based on iterative swaps of mappings until
local optimum (Chindelevitch et al., 2010). MI—GRAAL
(Kuchaiev and PrZulj, 2011) and variants (Kuchaiev et al.,
2010; Memisevic and Przulj, 2012; Milenkovic et al., 2010) use
greedy heuristics based on cost formulations including one or
more of the graphlet degree signatures, degrees, clustering coef—
ﬁcients, eccentricities and the sequence similarities in terms of
BLAST E—values. Other related network alignment problems in—
clude global many—to—many alignments (Ay et al., 2011; Liao
et al., 2009) and queries in interaction networks and pathways
(Banks et al., 2008; Dost et al., 2008; Pinter et al., 2005; Shlomi
et al., 2006).

A major issue in network alignment is the computational in—
tractability of all the appropriate optimization formulations. It
becomes even more apparent with some input PPI networks con—
taining tens of thousands of nodes and interactions. An import—
ant feature expected of the global network alignments is then
scalability; the running time performances of the suggested meth—
ods should not degrade drastically with increasing network sizes.
At the same time, accurate alignment scores close to optimum
values of appropriate formulations is a natural expectation.
However, existing approaches either aggressively optimize for
better accuracy at the expense of scalability or vice versa. We
propose a novel global network alignment algorithm, SPINAL,
which consists of two phases: a coarse—grained alignment score
estimations phase and a fine—grained conﬂict resolution and im—
provement phase. Both phases make use of the construction of
neighborhood bipartite graphs and a set of contributors as a
common primitive. Using these concepts within iterative local
improvement heuristics constitute the backbone of the algorithm.
In terms of scalability, SPINAL runs much faster and provides
more accurate results than the compared state—of—the—art meth—
ods in almost all of the experimented instances under
consideration.

2 METHODS AND ALGORITHMS

2.1 Problem definition

Let G1 = (V1,El) and G2 = (V2,E2) be two PPI networks
where V1, V2 denote the sets of nodes corresponding to the pro—
teins and E1,E2 denote the sets of edges corresponding to the
interactions between proteins. We deﬁne an alignment network
A12 =(V12,E12). Each node of V12 is denoted with a pair
< u,~,vj >, where u,~ 6 V1 and V] 6 V2. For any pair of nodes
< u,~,vj >6 V12 and < 14,12; >6 V12 it should be the case that
14,75  and V] 75  The edge set of the alignment network is
deﬁned so that any conserved interaction gives rise to an edge
in the network, that is, for < 14,, v; >6 V12 and < 14w; >6 V12,
the edge (< 14,, v, > , < 14v; >) 6 E12 if and only if (u,~, 14;.) 6 E1
and (vi, v;) 6 E2.

Although an explicit deﬁnition of an alignment network is not
given, informally the common goal in most of the previous

global PPI network alignment approaches is to provide an align—
ment so that the edge set E12 is large and each pair of node
mappings in the set V12 contains proteins with high sequence
similarity (Chindelevitch et al., 2010; Kuchaiev and PrZulj,
2011; Singh et al., 2008; Zaslavskiy et al., 2009). Formally, we
deﬁne the pairwise global PPI network alignment problem as that
of ﬁnding the alignment network A12 2 (V12,E12) that maxi—
mizes the global network alignment score, defined as follows:

GNAS(A12) 2 at X IE12|+(1—Ot)>< Z seq(u,~,vj) (l)

V-<u,~, vj>

The constant at 6 [0, 1] in this equation is a balancing param—
eter intended to vary the relative importance of the
network—topological similarity (conserved interactions) and the
sequence similarities reﬂected in the second term of the sum.
Each seq(u,~, vi) can be an appropriately deﬁned sequence simi—
larity score based on measures such as BLAST bit—scores or
E—values.

2.2 The SPINAL global alignment algorithm

For the special case of at = 1, the pairwise global PPI network
alignment problem becomes a generalized version of the
Maximum Common Edge Subgraph (M CES) problem used
commonly in the matchings of 2D/3D chemical structures
(Raymond and Willett, 2002). The MCES of two undirected
graphs G1, G2 is a common subgraph (not necessarily induced)
that contains the largest number of edges common to both G1
and G2. The NP—hardness of the MCES problem (Garey and
Johnson, 1979) trivially implies that the defined network align—
ment problem is also NP—hard. Although useful in certain as—
pects, such a result does not provide sufﬁcient intuition to grasp
the nature of the problem, which involves simultaneous opti—
mization of two possibly conﬂicting properties. In addition,
PPI networks usually exhibit certain topological properties that
may affect the computational complexity of an optimization
problem deﬁned on them. Nevertheless, we show that the prob—
lem with its simultaneous nature is computationally intractable
even for two paths. This result holds for all at values other than 0
and 1. The full proof of the following theorem can be found in
the Supplementary Document.

THEOREM 2.1. The pairwise global PPI network alignment prob—
lem is NP—hard for a pair of paths.

The intrinsic computational hardness of the problem gives rise
to the design of local heuristic approaches rather than globally
optimum solutions. Most of the global network alignment algo—
rithms can be viewed to proceed in two phases. For each pair
u,~ 6 V1, V] 6 V2, an estimate conﬁdence score is sought at an ini—
tial coarse—grained phase. The score represents the level of con—
fidence that the match (u,~,v,) is in the optimum alignment
maximizing the global score deﬁned in Equation (1). This is usu—
ally followed by a fine—grained phase that consists of reﬁning an
initial global alignment based on the estimate scores attained in
the previous phase. Similar in spirit to the previous global PPI
network alignment algorithms, SPINAL also proceeds in two
phases. However, the deﬁnition and the construction method
of the conﬁdence scores matrix in the coarse—grained phase,
and the reﬁnement method in the fine—grained phase constitute

the novelties of our algorithm. We ﬁrst introduce the construc—
tion of neighborhood bipartite graph and the computation of its
maximum weight matching, both of which together constitute
the common primitive operation used in both phases. Let S be
a function mapping every pair of vertices u,~ 6 V1, v, 6 V2 to a
real valued weight. Denote the set of neighbors of u,- in G1 with
N(u,~) and the set of neighbors of v,- in G2 with N(vj). The neigh—
borhood bipartite graph of the pair < u,~, v, > on S, denoted with
NBQ({< u,~, v, >}, S) is a complete edge—weighted bipartite graph
defined on the partitions N(u,~) and N(v,«). The weight of an edge
(x,~,yj) in NBQ is S(x,~,yj). Similarly, we define NBQ of a set of
pairs rather than that of a single pair, as the union of the NBgs
of the constituent pairs.

2.2.1 Coarse—grained construction of estimate scores Let P(u,~, v/)
for u,~ 6 V1, v, 6 V2 denote the estimate conﬁdence score of align—
ing u,- with v,. The contributors, that is, the set of edges in the
maximum weight matching of NBQ({< u,~, v; >}, S) is denoted
with C. Among all edges in N89, those are the only ones con—
tributing to the score P(u,~, vi), which is deﬁned as follows:

P(x; 1 )7)
(legal (xz)><d<’g(.-2 by)

m

where degG](x,~),degGZ(y/) denote the degrees of x,- and y_,- in G1
and G2, respectively, and seq(u,~, vi) denotes the normalized
BLAST bit scores of the proteins corresponding to u,- and VI.
Note that although Equation (2) resembles the functional simi—
larity score used in IsoRank and various alignment methods
based on it (Ay et al., 2011; Liao et al., 2009), there is a crucial
difference. In the IsoRank deﬁnition, there is no concept of spe—
cial contributors; every (x,~, )1) pair in the immediate

(xi, yj)6 C

at X + (l — at) X seq(u,~, vi) (2)

neighborhood contributes to the score inverse proportional to
its degree product. In the special case of a: 1, such a choice
makes the equation local; for each pair of nodes assigning a
score proportional to their degree product trivially satisﬁes the
equation (Chindelevitch, 2010). In contrast, Equation (2) dis—
ables the contributions of pairs that have no chances of coexist—
ence in the final alignment by imposing the contributors set be a
matching. Furthermore, it enables contributions of pairs with
higher chances of existence in the optimum solution by imposing
the matching have maximum weight. To construct the scores
matrix P in accordance with our deﬁnition, we follow an iterative
approach similar to the simple gradient method used in energy
minimization (Holtje et al., 1997). Every iteration brings the
score of a pair close to the scores of the contributors from the pre—
vious iteration. Note that not only the scores but also the con—
tributors of a speciﬁc pair themselves may change; at each
iteration the set of contributors is constructed anew. The iter—
ations continue until the score of every pair remains the same as
in previous iteration; see lines 7614 in Algorithm 1. As is usually
the case with similar iterative methods, it is important to start
with a good initial conﬁguration both for the quality of results
and for the convergence rate. We initialize the score of each pair
taking into account the sequence similarity values and the degree
differences [denoted with DegDiﬂ(u,~, vi) and normalized between
0 and 1] in lines 466. It is worth noting that the loop in lines 7614
converges in only 10615 iterations even for considerably large
networks.

2.2.2 Fine—grained conﬂict resolution and improvement Once the
scores matrix P is ready, the next step is to extract a one—to—one
mapping of node pairs in a way that the resulting mapping in—
duces a high score in terms of Equation (1). We follow a
seed—and—extend approach coupled with local improvements
based on iterative swaps. We note that both these techniques
are standard heuristics in combinatorial optimization and differ—
ent versions have also been used in previous alignment algo—
rithms (Altschul et al., 1990; Chindelevitch et al., 2010;
Kuchaiev et al., 2010; Kuchaiev and PrZulj, 2011; Shih and
Parthasarathy, 2011).

The NBQ and the contributors’ concepts, which constituted
the basis of the coarse—grained phase are the main primitives of
this phase as well. The pseudocode is provided in lines 1&26
of Algorithm 1. The basic idea is to ﬁnd a connected component
of the alignment network A 12 at each iteration of the outer repeat
loop. Each component starts with the best available seed. It is the
pair (u,~, vi) with the largest score in P, such that neither u,- nor v,-
is aligned. The component grows layer by layer in an almost
breadth—ﬁrst manner. At each iteration of the inner repeat
loop, a new breadth—ﬁrst layer of G12 is added to the current
component of A12. For this, we first construct the MEG of the
set of the aligned pairs in the current component, which is the
union of N BQs of each pair. Assuming the weight of each edge is
its estimate conﬁdence score in P, a maximum—weight matching
of NBQ provides a set of candidate contributors to be added to
the current component of the alignment graph. Because the
scores in P are solely estimate scores of conﬁdence, even an op—
timum maximum—weight matching may have room for improve—
ment as far as the GNAS score of Equation (1) is concerned.
Therefore, our final step is to improve the candidate set locally

via possible swaps. Each pair in NBQ but not among the candi—
dates is compared against its overlap set, that is, the set of can—
didate contributors sharing a node with it. If the contribution of
the new pair to the GNAS score is not smaller than that of its
overlap set, it is inserted into A12 rather than the overlap set.
In terms of running time requirements, in almost all the tests,
>95% of the execution time is spent by the initial coarse—grained
phase. We note that in the actual implementation, the contribu—
tors set in the ﬁrst phase is computed via a greedy maximal
matching algorithm, whereas for the second phase, an optimum
solution is used. Details of the SPINAL algorithm, including
implementation details, a discussion of stability and running
time analysis, are provided in the Supplementary Document.

3 DISCUSSION OF RESULTS

SPINAL is implemented in C++ using LEDA (Mehlhom and
Naher, 1999). Source code, useful Python scripts for testing and
evaluations, all the data and output results are available as part
of the Supplementary Material. We experiment on data from
four species: Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster,
Caenorhabditis elegans and Homo sapiens. All the data are from
IsoBase (Park et al., 2011), which is the same as that used in
IsoRank and IsoRankN. The PPI network sizes are as follows:
5499 proteins and 31 261 interactions in the S.cerevisiae network,
7518 proteins and 25 635 interactions in the D.melanogaster net—
work, 2805 proteins and 4495 interactions in the C.elegans net—
work and 9633 proteins and 34 327 interactions in the H.sapiens
network. Potentially, SPINAL can be compared with other
alignment algorithms with a similar problem deﬁnition forma—
lized by Equation (1). These are IsoRank, MI—GRAAL and vari—
ants, GA, PATH heuristics and the PISwap algorithm. We
extensively compare SPINAL with IsoRank and MI—GRAAL.
IsoRank is a popular benchmark algorithm in global network
alignment. Recently suggested MI—GRAAL, to the best of our
knowledge, provided the best alignments in terms of the number
of conserved interactions previously. The current implementa—
tions of GA and PATH are not amenable for the alignment of
networks with sizes similar to those under consideration
(Kuchaiev and Priulj, 2011). For lack of a publicly available
implementation of PISwap, only brief comparisons with the pub—
lished results are made whenever applicable.

3.1 Global network alignment score evaluations

We ﬁrst measure the extent of accuracies of the algorithms in
terms of the maximization objective formulated in Equation (1).
The number of conserved interactions, that is, the edge set size of
the alignment network, denoted with E12 in the equation is a
common performance indicator used in almost all the global
network alignment studies (Chindelevitch et al., 2010; Klau,
2009; Kuchaiev et al., 2010; Kuchaiev and PrZulj, 2011;
Milenkovic et al., 2010; Singh et al., 2008; Zaslavskiy et al.,
2009). Because the optimization goal is also commonly deﬁned
as in Equation (1), we include the score obtained from
GNAS(A12) as well as |E12| in our evaluations of an alignment
A12. Table 1 summarizes our ﬁndings for the SPINAL, IsoRank
and MI—GRAAL algorithms. For each of the six dataset pairs,
we include two rows: top row indicates the size of conserved

interactions set E12 and the bottom row indicates the score ob—
tained from GNAS(A12). Each column represents the scores of
an alignment output by a speciﬁc algorithm under a speciﬁc
setting of input parameters. Parameter settings for SPINAL
and IsoRank consist of varying the or constant from 0.3 to 0.7
in the increments of 0. 1. As for the MI—GRAAL algorithm, three
alignment versions are described in the original description
(Kuchaiev and Priulj, 2011). The Alignment3 version refers to
an output alignment obtained when signatures, degrees, cluster—
ing coefficients and BLAST sequence similarities are all used by
the algorithm. It is mentioned that the largest set of conserved
interactions are obtained under Alignment3 and that its results
are the most stable, in the sense that different runs provide
almost the same results (Kuchaiev and PrZulj, 2011). Therefore,
we present evaluations of this version for MI—GRAAL. For each
row measuring the size of conserved interactions set, the largest
score is marked in bold. The number of conserved interactions
attained by the SPINAL alignments is impressive. The
state—of—the—art algorithm known to achieve the largest conserva—
tion scores was MI—GRAAL. Table 1 indicates that in five of
the six alignment pairs, SPINAL provides the highest score in
terms of E12 sizes. Only for the C.elegansiDmelanogaster pair,
MI—GRAAL provides better edge conservation. The GNAS(A12)
scores for the MI—GRAAL alignments are computed under the
setting of or = 0.7. For the instances where MI—GRAAL columns
are marked with a X, Alignment3 could not be successfully exe—
cuted until completion. We were able to execute Alignment] ver—
sion using signatures for the hs—sc instance. Interaction
conservation and the GNAS scores of a single run were, respect—
ively, 5277 and 3693.95. Regarding scores of conserved inter—
actions, our final remark is on published results of PISwap
using the data of Bandyopadhyay et al. (2006). On the same
dataset, SPINAL produces an alignment with 3890 conserved
interactions for the D.melanogasteriS.cerevisiae pair, whereas
the PISwap alignment achieves 398 interactions.

Emphasizing the issue of scalability, we provide a sample com—
parison of execution times. The pair of largest and densest
networks for which all three methods provide alignments is
H.sapiensiS.cerevisiae. The execution times of SPINAL,
IsoRank and MI—GRAAL (The Alignment] version of
MI—GRAAL that uses graphlet degree signatures is used.
Nevertheless, Alignment3 version, which could not be executed
until completion on this dataset is expected to require an even
larger execution time because it uses three additional cost func—
tions.) on this dataset are, respectively, 49, 116 and 305 min. The
contrast between SPINAL and MI—GRAAL is especially signiﬁ—
cant, as previously the latter was known to provide the highest
conserved interaction ratios. SPINAL runs almost ﬁve times
faster than MI—GRAAL and provides almost 10% more con—
served interactions. We note that the running time experiments
were performed on a 64—bit machine with Intel Core i5 2.27 GHz
processors and 4 GB of memory.

3.2 Gene ontology consistency evaluations

A common measure to test the biological quality of alignments is
based on gene ontology (GO) consistency of the aligned pairs of
proteins. For an alignment A12, we deﬁne G0C(A12) as the sum
of |G0(u,~) ﬂ G0(v,«)|/|G0(u,~) U G0(v,«)|, over all aligned pairs

tating a protein x. We exclude the annotations to the root terms,
Biological Process, Cellular Component and Molecular Function.
The GO annotations are retrieved from the GO Consortium
(Ashburner et al., 2000).

The results presented in Table 1 are valuable in providing an
idea on the extent of conserved interactions achieved by different
algorithms. However the same strategy of comparisons based on
ﬁxed or values can not be directly used in GOC evaluations of
IsoRank and SPINAL, although both algorithms use the same
global optimization function. This is mainly due to the variance
in total sequence similarity scores achieved by resulting align—
ments even for the same or instances. Because many GO annota—
tions are based on sequence alignments themselves, such
comparisons would produce misleading results. This discrepancy
has been observed and handled in different ways in previous
studies (Kuchaiev and Priulj, 2011; Zaslavskiy et al., 2009).
We follow both approaches and compute GOC scores
accordingly.

The main idea of Zaslavskiy et al. (2009) is to compare the
alignments achieved under ﬁxed total sequence similarity scores
when possible. The SPINAL algorithm, especially in the
ﬁne—grained phase in Algorithm 1, aggressively aims at increasing
the size of E12 to achieve higher scores for GNAS(A12). For the
PPI network alignment problem formalized by Equation (1), this
makes sense, as a large portion of all pairs contributes little to the
alignment score through their sequence similarity scores. On
the other hand, it may not be possible to produce alignments
with some speciﬁc total sequence similarity values, especially the
large ones. Therefore, we introduce another version of our algo—
rithm, SPINAL,, that only makes use of the coarse—grained
phase of Algorithm 1 and similar to IsoRank simply applies a
maximum weight bipartite matching for the ﬁne—grained phase.
This provides an opportunity to evaluate SPINAL and IsoRank
better, as the coarse—grained phases of both algorithms are
defined to solve exactly the same problem. The results for all

six pairs of PPI networks are presented in Table 2. The
IsoRank [IsoRank provides two separate alignments. To provide
a fair comparison, the GO consistency evaluations of Table 2 are
those obtained from the IsoRankHSp version, the alignment that
is mentioned to provide better GO consistencies (Singh et al.,
2008)] results in the table correspond to the alignments under
the shown or values ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 in the increments of
0.1. On the other hand, for a fixed a, each SPINAL, result cor—
responds to the alignment that achieves as close a total sequence
similarity score as possible, to that of the IsoRank alignment
under a. In almost all cases, the difference in the corresponding
total sequence similarity scores is <0.1; hence, the gathered align—
ments are comparable. Among all 30 alignment instances,
SPINAL, provides better results than IsoRank, except for
three instances. The differences between the GOC scores
become more apparent as the network sizes get larger. Also, in
terms of the number of conserved interactions, for all pairwise
alignments and or values, SPINAL, provides much better results
than IsoRank. This is signiﬁcant because it provides a clue that
optimizing the number of conserved interactions under ﬁxed
total sequence similarities leads to better functional orthology
detection, a conjecture assumed to have limited evidence previ—
ously (Zaslavskiy et al., 2009). For comparisons with
MI—GRAAL, we use the Alignment3 version of the algorithm,
as it makes use of sequence information and is favored over the
other alignment types to be the basis of function predictions of
unannotated proteins (Kuchaiev and Priulj, 2011). Both the
SPINAL and the MI—GRAAL algorithms aggressively aim at
improving the number of conserved interactions. For a fair com—
parison, we can actually pick any alignment of SPINAL that
provides better conserved interaction scores than those of the
MI—GRAAL Alignment3 results from Table 1. We pick or = 0.7
instance of SPINAL, even though in many cases even or = 0.3
alignments with better chances of large GOC scores produce
better conserved interaction ratios. Nevertheless, SPINAL GO
consistency scores are much higher than those of MI—GRAAL in

all pairwise alignments. For the C.elegansiDmelanogaster pair,
the SPINAL alignment produces a GOC score of 79.57, whereas
the score of MI—GRAAL alignment is 14.41. For the C.elegans6
H.sapiens, C.elegansiS.cerevisiae and the D.melanogaster6
S.cerevisiae pairs, the scores are 43 versus 15.64, 60.03 versus
24.97 and 113.01 versus 50.51, respectively.

Secondly, to account for the effects of sequence similarities in
the GO consistency evaluations, we repeated the same experi—
ments following the approach of Kuchaiev and Przulj (2011).
The idea is to consider only the experimental GO annotations,
that is, those with evidence codes IPI, IGI, IMP, IDA, IEP, TAS
and IC. Because the resulting relative GOC scores are almost the
same, we do not provide separate tables. Among all 30 instances
corresponding to the ones presented in Table 2, in only ﬁve of
them IsoRank provides slightly better GOC scores than
SPINAL,. For the rest, SPINAL, provides higher scores and
the differences between achieved scores are relatively large for
many of them. Finally, comparing SPINAL and MI—GRAAL,
we get the same results as in the previous approach. In all in—
stances, SPINAL provides much higher scores than
MI—GRAAL.

We note that because GO category organization is hierarchical
and there might be speciﬁc categories at levels further away from
the root of the GO DAG, expecting exact category overlaps can
be a strong requirement for GO consistency evaluations.
Therefore, similar to the evaluation method suggested in Singh
et al. (2008), we repeated the same tests annotating each protein
to a standardized set of GO categories (those at distance 5 from
the root of GO DAG) and considering the resulting category
overlaps. Furthermore, to test the algorithms on different data—
sets, we created experiments based on synthethic PPI network
data of Sahraeian and Yoon (2012) and evaluated the algorithms
using this database and the IsoBase database under several add—
itional metrics including mean normalized entropy, coverage,
correct nodes and specificity. In general, the results are along
the lines of those presented in this section. Details regarding all

these extensive evaluations can be found in the Supplementary
Document.

3.3 Annotation transfers via network alignment

PPI networks of single species have been studied in depth to
predict functions of unannotated proteins or to extract biological
pathways; see Sharan et al. (2007) for a survey on the topic.
Another way to extract such information has been through a
detailed analysis of proteins with sequence similarities (Louie
et al., 2009). It is natural to assume that alignment networks of
pairwise PPIs should provide analog information because they
provide a model to integrate both kinds of data. Accordingly,
previous network alignment studies suggest protein function pre—
dictions via annotation transfers, that is, via assigning the anno—
tations of a protein in an aligned pair to the unannotated
member of the same pair (Kuchaiev and Priulj, 2011; Singh
et al., 2008). However, a detailed analysis demonstrates that
such automated transfers by themselves may not always be suf—
ficient to provide immediate function predictions. Incorporating
the global alignment results into the function prediction methods
using network analysis techniques provides more reliable predic—
tions (Sharan and Ideker, 2006). Although a methodological
treatment of this issue is beyond the scope of this article, we
present a more detailed analysis of the H.sapiensiS.cerevisiae
alignment network to provide a basis for such an integration.
We choose to analyze the SPINAL, alignment resulting from the
settings used in the or = 0.3 column of Table 2. Details regarding
this alignment network can be found in the Supplementary
Document.

Graph—theoretic approaches to identify key regulatory pro—
teins in an organism by analyzing local PPI network structures
have been suggested previously (Fox et al., 2011). Following
similar reasoning, we extract neighborhood subgraphs induced
by a node and its neighbors in the alignment network to identify
key pairs of proteins. Each key pair is considered suitable for a
possible annotation transfer. For each < u,~, v, >, we compute a

dominating annotation, dom(< u,~, v, >) and a domination count,
dc(< u,~, v, >). Let Sum] denote the subgraph induced by
< u,~, v, > U{< x,,yj >: (< x,,yj >, < u,~, v, >) 6 E12}. We count
the number of times each GO annotation appears in any node
of Sui‘vj. Note that an annotation appearing in any of the
proteins of a node contributes to the count. The largest
count is dc(< u,~,v,«>) and the corresponding annotation is
dom(< u,~, v, >). We exclude all GO annotations derived from
Cellular Component. To extract a list of hubs in decreasing
order of importance, we sort the dc values of all nodes with
two exceptions. If < u;,v; >6 Sum] and dc(< u;,v; >) <
dc(< u,~, v, >), then < u}, v; > is not included in the list.
Additionally, if dom(< u}, v; >) = dom(< u,~, v, >) and
dc(< u}, v; >) <dc(< u,~, v, >), then < u}, v; > is not in the list.
For this analysis, among the top 10 nodes in the list, we
consider those with five or more neighbors that contain three
or more GO annotation overlaps. Six such nodes are identiﬁed.
Going from 1 to 6, the matches corresponding to those nodes
and their dominating annotations are, respectively, as follows:

TBP|YER148W regulation of transcription, DNA—dependent

(GO:0006355), RAN|YLR293C transport (GO:0006810),
LOC392454|YBR088C DNA binding (GO:0003677),
POLR2A|YDL140C transcription, DNA dependent

(GO:0006351), TAF7|YPL011C RNA polymerase II transcrip—
tional preinitiation complex assembly (GO:0051123),
MCM2|YBL023C DNA replication (GO:0006260). The domin—
ation counts are 17, 15, 14, 13, 10 and 10, respectively. It is worth
noting that some of the identiﬁed hub matches themselves con—
tain considerably large GO annotation overlaps. The
TBP|YER148W match has 5, RAN|YLR293C match has 10,
POLR2A|YDL140C match has 9 and MCM2|YBL023C
match has 14 overlaps. We expect each protein involved in a
match contain an annotation same as or similar to (descending
from a not too distant common ancestor in the GO dag) its
dominating annotation. We realize an annotation transfer for
an unannotated protein in a match, if its mate in the alignment
and a considerable number of its neighbors in its own PPI net—
work are annotated with the dominating annotation.

Both proteins in the TBP|YER148W match are annotated
exactly with the dominating annotation. Proteins in the
RAN|YLR293C match on the other hand are not annotated
with the dominating annotation, GO:0006810, although both
are annotated with a similar category, GO:0006886 (intracellular
protein transport). Considering the LOC392454|YBR088C
match, LOC392454 does not contain any annotations, whereas
YBR088C contains the dominating annotation of the match,
GO:0003677 (DNA binding). The neighborhood of
LOC392454 in the H.sapiens PPI network contains 81 proteins.
Among these, 44 of them are unannotated. On the other hand,
only 14 are not annotated with DNA binding or related cate—
gories. Twelve neighbors have been annotated with exactly DNA
binding and 11 have annotations that are similar (nucleic acid
binding, chromatin binding, double—stranded DNA binding,
damaged DNA binding). This provides a clue that the match
LOC392454|YBR088C has been correctly identiﬁed as a regulat—
ing hub and LOC392454 should also be annotated with
GO:0003677 (DNA binding). Regarding the POLR2A|
YDL140C match, we verify that YDL140C is annotated
with GO:0006351 (transcription, DNA—dependent). Although

POLR2A is not annotated with the same category, it has a simi—
lar annotation GO:0006355 (regulation of transcription,
DNA—dependent). With regard to the TAF7|YPL011C match,
YPL011C is annotated with exactly the dominating annotation.
Although it is tempting to transfer the dominating annotation to
TAF7, which is unannotated, a careful analysis reveals that
among the 20 neighbors of TAF7, only one of them contains
the annotation GO:0051123. Twelve do not contain related cate—
gories, and the rest are unannotated. This is in accordance with
the results of Fox et al. (2011), as the TAF7|YPL011C hub is
what Fox et al. (2011) call a single—component hub and can not be
counted as a regulating hub. Therefore, we do not apply an an—
notation transfer in this case. Finally, regarding the
MCM2|YBL023C match, it is veriﬁed that both proteins are
annotated with the dominating annotation.

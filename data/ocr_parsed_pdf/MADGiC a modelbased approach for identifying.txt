Abstract

Motivation: Identifying and prioritizing somatic mutations is an important and challenging area of
cancer research that can provide new insights into gene function as well as new targets for drug
development. Most methods for prioritizing mutations rely primarily on frequency—based criteria,
where a gene is identified as having a driver mutation if it is altered in significantly more samples
than expected according to a background model. Although useful, frequency—based methods are
limited in that all mutations are treated equally. It is well known, however, that some mutations
have no functional consequence, while others may have a major deleterious impact. The spatial
pattern of mutations within a gene provides further insight into their functional consequence.
Properly accounting for these factors improves both the power and accuracy of inference. Also im—
portant is an accurate background model.

Results: Here, we develop a Model—based Approach for identifying Driver Genes in Cancer (termed
MADGiC) that incorporates both frequency and functional impact criteria and accommodates a
number of factors to improve the background model. Simulation studies demonstrate advantages
of the approach, including a substantial increase in power over competing methods. Further advan—
tages are illustrated in an analysis of ovarian and lung cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) project.

1 Introduction

 

Cancer is thought to result from the accumulation of causal somatic
mutations throughout the lifetime of an individual. These cancer—
driving mutations function by altering one of three broad classes of
genes: oncogenes, which activate neoplastic activity; tumor—suppres—
sor genes, which decrease a cell’s ability to inhibit abnormal cell
proliferation and stability genes, which affect a cell’s damage repair
mechanisms (Kinzler and Vogelstein, 1997; Vogelstein and Kinzler,
2004). A first causal mutation in one of these classes of genes (or a
rate—limiting combination thereof) leads to tumorigenesis, and sub—
sequent causal mutational events drive tumor progression by

providing a selective advantage to the cancer cells through positive
selection (Bozic et (11., 2010; Vogelstein et (11., 2013; Vogelstein and
Kinzler, 2004; Wood et (11., 2007).

A major area of cancer research revolves around identifying
these causal mutations, as doing so may provide new insights into
gene function as well as potential targets for drug development.
Methods for distinguishing genes with causal mutations (‘driver
genes’) from those containing only background mutations (‘passen—
ger genes’) which are irrelevant to cancer growth are also vital in
making sense of the vast amounts of information being gathered
from tumor sequencing studies such as The Cancer Genome Atlas

project (http://cancergenome.nih.gov/) and the Cancer Genome
Project (httpz//www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/cancergenome/).

A common approach to this problem is to identify genes that
harbor significantly more somatic mutations than expected by
chance. Methods using this approach, termed ‘frequency—based’
methods, rely on an estimate of a background mutation rate which
represents the rate of random passenger mutations. Early frequency—
based methods assumed a single background rate, constant across
the genome and common to all samples (Ding et (11., 2008).
However, a number of features are known to affect mutation rate:
mutation type (transition versus transversion), nucleotide context
(which base is at the mutation site), dinucleotide context (which
bases are located at neighboring sites to the mutation), replication
timing of the region and expression level of the gene. Further details
are provided in Section 2.3.

In an effort to get a more accurate estimate of the background
mutation rate, subsequent frequency—based methods have been de—
veloped that adjust for one or more of these factors. Sjoblom et al.
(2006) account for nucleotide and dinucleotide context in searching
for drivers of breast and colorectal cancer. MuSiC (Dees et (11.,
2012) accounts for mutation type and allows for sample—specific
mutation rates; and in addition to these factors, Lawrence et al.
(2013) (MutSigCV) also allow for the inclusion of gene—specific fac—
tors such as expression level and replication timing.

Although useful, a main limitation of methods based solely on
mutation frequency is the inherent assumption that driver genes
have relatively high mutation rates. This is often not the case.
Indeed, with a few notable exceptions such as TP53 and KRAS,
which show consistently high mutation rates in many cancers, most
driver genes harbor surprisingly few mutations (Vogelstein et (11.,
2013; Wood et (11., 2007). Consequently, additional criteria need to
be incorporated into the search beyond frequency if reliable driver
gene identifications are to be made.

Recent developments provide at least two new sources for such
information. The first are methods such as Sorting Intolerant From
Tolerant (SIFT) [first reported by Ng and Henikoff (2001), later
updated by Kumar et al. (2009)], Polyphen (Adzhubei et (11., 2010)
and MutationAssessor (Reva et (11., 2011) that incorporate informa—
tion from sequence context, position and protein characteristics to
assess a mutation’s functional impact. Recognizing the advantage of
prioritizing genes by functional impact information, Gonzalez—Perez
and Lopez—Bigas (2012) exploited bias in these scores as evidence of
driver activity in their method OncodriveFM.

To account for both frequency and function, Youn and Simon
(2011) (referred to hereinafter as YS) model mutation type, account
for sample—specific mutation rates and incorporate BLOSUM80
(BLOcks Substitution Matrix) alignment scores (Henikoff and
Henikoff, 1992) into their approach. BLOSUM80 alignment scores
reﬂect empirical probabilities associated with amino acid substitu—
tions; and YS use these scores as a measure of functional impact.
The idea is that if an amino acid substitution is rarely seen, it is
likely detrimental. Although useful, power and specificity is gained
by using methods such as those mentioned above that directly assess
functional impact specific to the gene and mutation of interest (Ng
and Henikoff, 2001).

In addition to advances regarding our ability to assess functional
impact at the single nucleotide level, major advances have also been
made with respect to our understanding of the spatial pattern of mu—
tations within driver genes. Indeed, Vogelstein et al. (2013) recently
noted that the best way to identify driver genes is not through their
mutation frequency as has often been done in the past, but rather
through their spatial patterns of mutation. Vogelstein’s claim is

based on the recognition that oncogenes are often mutated recur—
rently at the same amino acid positions while tumor suppressor
genes tend to have an over—abundance of truncating mutations
(frameshift indels, non—sense mutations or mutations at the normal
stop codon). These characteristic patterns were not known just a
few years ago, since they only become apparent with very large sam—
ple sizes. For example, even when looking at a dataset with close to
500 samples such as the TCGA ovarian, spatial patterning of muta—
tions is not obvious (see Fig. 1, left panel).

Recognition of such spatial patterns has been facilitated
largely by a project to catalogue somatic mutations in cancer
(Forbes et (11., 2011). The so—called COSMIC (Catalogue Of Somatic
Mutations In Cancer) project was initiated by the NIH in 2004 and
is ongoing, with new datasets being added several times per year.
The database currently contains mutation information for close to
one million samples in over 40 tissue types, including data from sev—
eral thousand whole exomes. Recent results from an integrative ana—
lysis across multiple cancers in COSMIC identified ‘highly
characteristic and non—random’ patterns of mutation that were not
apparent when studying cancers by type in isolation (Vogelstein et
(11., 2013). In particular, results demonstrated that many known
oncogenes consistently harbor mutations at relatively few specific
amino acid positions, suggesting that oncogenic activity does not re—
sult from random mutation(s) in an oncogene, but rather requires a
mutation in one of a few locations. OncodriveCLUST (Tamborero
et (11., 2013) was designed to exploit such evidence of positional
clustering to identify oncogenes (but like OncodriveFM does not
utilize other sources of information such as frequency of mutation
and functional impact). Non—random mutational patterns are also
observed in known tumor suppressor genes, which tend to exhibit
an over—abundance of protein—truncating alterations. The right panel
of Figure 1 provides a few examples. As we demonstrate, accounting
for these non—random spatial patterns and abundance of truncating
mutations improves both the sensitivity and specificity with which
driver genes may be identified.

In addition to these recently characterized patterns of mutation,
it is well known that alteration of DNA repair genes such as BRCA1
or BRCA2 leads to an increased accumulation of mutations
(Birkbak et (11., 2013). For those samples with mutations in known
DNA repair genes, any global increase in mutation rate will be
accommodated by our model’s sample—specific background rate esti—
mation (see Section 2.3.2).

In summary, the most important sources of information to consider
when identifying driver genes include: mutation frequency, mutation
type, gene—specific features such as replication timing and expression
level that are known to affect background rates of mutation, mutation—
specific scores that assess functional impact and the spatial patterning
of mutations that only becomes apparent when thousands of samples
are considered. Previously developed methods incorporate many of
these features (see Table 1 for an overview), but not all at once. In this
paper, we provide a unified empirical Bayesian Model—based Approach
for identifying Driver Genes in Cancer (MADGiC) that utilizes each of
these features. The Bayesian framework provides a natural way to le—
verage the mutational patterns observed in COSMIC as prior informa—
tion and provides gene—specific posterior probabilities of driver gene
activity. The posterior probabilities are informed by mutation fre—
quency relative to a background model that incorporates mutation
type and the gene—specific features mentioned above as well as position
specific functional impact scores. Results from a simulation study in
Section 3.1 suggest improved performance over currently available
methods. Further advantages are demonstrated in an analysis of data
from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project (Section 3.2).

2 Methods 2.1.2 Squamous cell lung carcinoma

2.1 TCGA somatic mutation data

The TCGA somatic mutation datasets consist of exome somatic
mutation calls between tumor tissue samples and normal samples
(from either matched tissue or blood) of cancer patients and are
freely available for download from the TCGA data download portal
(available at https://tcga—data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/). Each somatic
mutation is annotated for the sample(s) in which it occurs, its
chromosome and position, the gene in which it is located, the allele
found in the reference genome, the specific nucleotide change(s)
and the type of mutation (silent, missense, non—sense, frameshift
indel, in frame indel). The analysis presented here includes all
available ovarian and squamous cell lung cancer samples as of
October 1, 2013.

2.1.1 Ovarian cancer

In the collection of 463 ovarian cancer samples, there are 5849 silent
mutations (mutations that do not alter the amino acid sequence)
located in 4369 genes and 21 800 non—silent mutations (mutations
that cause a change in the amino acid sequence) located in 10 164
genes. The median (range) total number of mutations per sample is
60 (1—209). For silent mutations, the median (range) is 11 (0—51)
and 41 (0—175) for non—silent mutations. There is very little pos—
itional overlap of mutations across samples and only 62 genes have
a nonsilent mutation in more than 10 samples.

In the collection of 178 squamous cell lung cancer samples, there are 15
883 silent mutations located in 8191 genes and 49 418 non—silent muta—
tions located in 13 238 genes. The median (range) total number of mu—
tations per sample is 299.5 (4—3922). For silent mutations, the median
(range) is 71.5 (0—1374) and 229 (3—2548) for non—silent mutations.
There is very little positional overlap of mutations across samples, but
649 genes have a non—silent mutation in more than 10 samples.

The vast majority of squamous cell lung cancer cases are attrib—
uted to cigarette smoking (Kenfield et (11., 2008). Since cigarette
smoking is a known mutagen that results in an increased mutation
rate as well as characteristic mutation signatures (Pleasance et (11.,
2009), it is plausible that the driver genes may differ between smok—
ers and non—smokers because they are subject to different mutational
processes. This is problematic since most methods assume there
exists a common set of driver genes. To minimize the possibility of
including non—smoking—related cancer cases in the analysis, samples
with a mutation rate below the 5th percentile that were also re—
corded as current or lifelong non—smokers at the time of data collec—
tion were excluded. This resulted in the removal of 10 samples.

2.1.3 Simulated data

To facilitate comparisons with existing methods, two types of simu—
lations were considered. For SIM I simulations, 100 sets of random
passenger mutations were obtained by shufﬂing the observed

mutations from the TCGA ovarian dataset while preserving nucleo—
tide context and mutation type, but ignoring gene—specific factors
that affect mutation rate such as replication timing and expression
level (see Fig. 2 and Section 2.3 for details of these gene—specific fac—
tors). Each mutation in a given sample was randomly assigned a
new position, drawn from all possible positions with the same refer—
ence nucleotide and mutation type. Next, 100 sets of 30 driver genes
were randomly selected from the Cancer Gene Census [a set of
nearly 500 genes that have been implicated in some form of cancer,
manually curated by Futreal et al. (2004)] and non—silent mutations
were randomly added at three levels: either 3, 5 or 10 mutations
(total across all samples; 10 genes at each level). The choice of 30
driver genes was made to be on the order of the median number of
genes identified as drivers in the case studies. This resulted in a total
of 100 unique simulated datasets. One hundred sets of random pas—
senger mutations were obtained for SIM II in a similar way, but
accommodating the dependence of mutation rate on replication tim—
ing and expression level. Specifically, in this case each mutation in a
given sample was randomly assigned a new position, drawn from all
possible positions with the same reference nucleotide and mutation
type in the same replication timing and gene expression categories.
As in SIM I, 100 sets of 30 driver genes were randomly selected

from the Cancer Gene Census and non—silent mutations were ran—
domly added at three levels.

This same process was repeated to generate 100 SIM I and 100
SIM H datasets using the TCGA lung data since it was suspected that
some sample characteristics may inﬂuence the ability to detect driver
genes. In particular, the lung dataset differs from the ovarian in that it
has less than half the number of samples but more than twice the
number of somatic mutations. In addition, the sample—specific muta—
tion rates are much more heterogeneous in the lung dataset compared
to the ovarian. This can be seen in the ranges of detected mutations
per sample reported above. Note that the absolute number of muta—
tions in the true driver genes is the same for both simulation sets, and
consequently the relative mutation rate for driver genes in the simu—
lated ovarian data is higher than that in the simulated lung data.

2.2 Driver gene model framework

Our primary aim is to prioritize genes that have been somatically
mutated in cancer based on the likelihood that they are driver genes.
A driver gene is defined as a gene harboring a mutation that pro—
vides a selective advantage to the cancer cell. The empirical Bayesian
hierarchical mixture model framework we develop considers three
sources of evidence for driver activity: (i) increased frequency of

mutation compared to a gene—specific background mutation model,
(ii) evidence of functional impact and (iii) a non—random spatial pat—
tern of mutations. We detail the generative model framework in
Section 2.2.1 and the calculation of the posterior probabilities in
Section 2.2.2. Parameter estimation is discussed in Section 2.2.3 and
the use of spatial pattern data to inform the prior probability of
oncogenic activity is described in Section 2.2.4.

2.2.1 Generative model
Consider a single gene indexed by g, from a total of G genes having at
least one non—silent somatic mutation. Note that non—silent mutations
include missense mutations, frameshift indels and in frame indels.
Further consider an independent sample of size ], indexed by /, each
with at leas_t one non—silent somatic mutation in one or more of the G
genes. Let Xg : X1g, . . . ,X ]g be the vector of observed non—silent mu—
tation states of gene g for all samples (where Xig E {0, 1} and 1 : one
or more non—silent mugations anywhere in the gene; 0 : no mutations
in the gene). Next, let Sg : 51g, . . . ,Slg be the vector of functional im—
pact scores for mutations in gene g for all samples. Finally let
Zg E {0, 1} be the indicator that gene g exhibits driver activity.

We are interested in the posterior probability that gene g is a
driver gene given the mutation status and impact score for that gene
across] independent samples:

 

1
P(zg : 1)HP(S,-g : 5,,x, : x,(zg : 1) (1)
L (:1
_ 1
Z P(Zg : k)HP(S/'g : 51'in : inZg : 8)
k6{0,1} i:1

We assume that the presence of mutations in gene g and sample / de—
pends on driver status. Specifically, Xig12g : z N Bern((1 — z)b,-
+zdg) where big 6 (0, 1) is the background (passenger) mutation
probability for sample /, gene g and dg E (0, 1) is the driver mutation
probability for gene g. To enforce that the driver mutation probabil—
ity is at least as high as the average passenger mutation probability
(i.e. that dg > 0g), we let dg ~ Beta(or, If) truncated below at 0g.

Likewise, we assume that the distribution of functional impact
scores across all genes and all samples depends on driver status.
Specifically, Sig1Xig : 1,Zg : z N (1 — z)fp +zfd, where f? is the
distribution of functional impact scores for passenger genes and )‘zi is
the distribution of functional impact scores for driver genes. Note
that we are assuming a common functional impact score profile for
all driver mutations, and another for all passenger mutations, inde—
pendent of mutation frequency.

2.2.2 Likelihood and posterior calculations

For ] independent samples with observed mutation states 35 and
scores ?, the data likelihood for gene g given driver status Zg, driver
mutation probability dg and estimates gig, f , f is

Note that this probability depends on dg, which is unknown.
Thus, we calculate the prior predictive distributions

P(Sg : an : ;]Zg : 1) and P(Sg : an : ;]Zg : 0) by aver—

the posterior probability is easily obtained from Equation (1).

2.2.3 Parameter estimation

We use the background mutation model that will be described in
Section 2.3 to get an empirical Bayes estimate of big. Recall that the
global hyperparameters or and l)’ govern the prior probability that a
driver gene is mutated and consequently they are estimated using the
method of moments from tissue—specific mutation data of known
cancer genes [from the Cancer Gene Census (Futreal et (11., 2004)] in
COSMIC. To avoid overfitting the model, any samples included in a
dataset of interest should be removed prior to estimation of the
hyperparameters. Here, e.g. TCGA ovarian and lung samples were
removed; see Supplementary Section $2.24 for details.

To assess functional impact, we use SIFT scores from Liu et al.
(2011), which range from zero to one, transformed such that scores
closer to one represent high impact (Kumar et (11., 2009). If there is
more than one non—silent mutation in gene g for sample /, we let Sig
take the value of the maximum functional impact score for all muta—
tions in the gene. If there are no non—silent mutations in gene g for
sample /, we let Sig : —1. To estimate fd(-), the distribution of func—
tional impact scores for driver genes, we first obtain SIFT scores for
a random sample of non—silent mutations, generated by shufﬂing the
observed mutations subject to the constraints of the background mu—
tation model. We then estimate fd(-) using non—parametric spline re—
gression on the ratio of the simulated null to the observed full
distribution f of scores across bins of the score range, a technique
used by Efron et al. (2001) to estimate the non—null distribution of
z—scores in the analysis of gene expression microarray experiments.
Specifically, 50 equally spaced bins and a natural spline with 5 de—
grees of freedom were used. Though our functional impact score of
choice here is SIFT, this non—parametric approach accommodates
other available functional impact scoring schemes.

2.2.4 Quantifying gene-specific mutation patterns

Motivated by the fact that genes showing a random pattern of muta—
tions across cancers in COSMIC are less likely to be drivers than
those showing concentrated mutations (more likely to be oncogenes)
or those showing an overabundance of protein—truncating mutations
(more likely to be tumor suppressors) (Vogelstein et (11., 2013), for
every gene g we calculate a prior probability of driver activity
(P(Zg : 1)) using all mutations observed for that gene in COSMIC
(excluding TCGA ovarian and lung cancer cases and only including
data from whole—gene screens). Specifically, to quantify evidence of
concentrated mutations, for each gene we calculate its positional en—
tropy compared to a random distribution of mutations across all
amino acids. Genes with low entropy are ones with highly concen—
trated mutations. Similarly, we test each gene to see if it has a signifi—
cantly higher proportion of truncating mutations than the proportion

MADGiC: a model—based approach for identifying driver genes

of truncating mutations observed over all genes. Genes with sig—
nificantly low entropy or a significantly high proportion of truncating
mutations (P < 0.05 ) are assigned a higher prior probability of onco—
genic activity (P(Zg : 1) : 0.5); otherwise P(Zg : 1) : 0.01.
Examples are shown in Figure 1; see Supplementary Section $2.25
for further details. The specific values of 0.5 and 0.01 are arbitrary,
but empirical sensitivity analyses (see Supplementary Section S3) dem—
onstrated little variability in results for values between 0.25 and 0.75
and between 0.005 and 0.05, respectively.

2.3 Background mutation model

We build on the YS background model and extend it to incorporate
external information that has been shown to affect mutation rates,
namely replication timing and expression level. Substantial variation
in somatic mutation rates, up to 33% in normal and 60% in cancer
cells, has been attributed to variation in the replication timing of
DNA (Koren et (11., 2012; Woo and Li, 2012). In short, regions that
replicate later have higher mutation rates due to the decreased
amount of time the replication machinery has to perform repairs
compared to earlier replicating regions (Pleasance et (11., 2009).

Figure 2 (top) shows this effect in the TCGA ovarian dataset. As
shown, the pattern persists when looking only at a specific mutation
type (transitions versus transversions) and nucleotide context (CpG
versus non—CpG dinucleotide). Similar patterns are observed in the
lung dataset (see Supplementary Fig. S1). Thus, it is not likely that
the pattern can be explained by differences in rates of specific types
of mutations across the regions. If this factor was to be ignored,
then the background rate for late—replication regions would likely be
underestimated, whereas the background rate for early—replicating
regions would be overestimated.

Variation in mutation rate has also been observed with gene ex—
pression level. Specifically, Chapman et al. (2011) discovered that
there are fewer mutations observed in genes that are expressed at a
higher level on average in cancer cells. It is thought that transcrip—
tion—coupled repair mechanisms are responsible for this effect. As in
the case of replication timing, the differences in mutation rate by ex—
pression level remain largely consistent within mutation type and
nucleotide context. This can be seen in Figure 2 (bottom), where the
mutation rate is plotted for three gene expression level categories.
As with replication timing, if this factor is ignored, the background
rate for lowly expressed genes will be underestimated.

These two gene—specific factors explain additional variation in
mutation rate beyond that contributed by the position—specific fac—
tors of mutation type and nucleotide context. However, some genes
still have an inexplicably high mutation rate even after accounting
for all the previously mentioned factors. Notably, the class of genes
known as olfactory receptors has a near 2—fold increase in mutation
rate compared to genes with similar replication timing and expres—
sion levels in the two TCGA datasets examined (see Supplementary
Fig. S2). Here we classify genes as olfactory receptors using gene
symbols to obtain a set of size 323 genes (see Supplementary Section
$21 for details). While it is unclear why these genes have elevated
rates of somatic mutation, they are known to exhibit substantial
genetic diversity in terms of both single nucleotide polymorphisms
and copy number variation (Hasin et (11., 2008). Consequently, the
background model adjusts for the expected increase in the number
of background mutations for this class of genes.

2.3.1 Adjusting for gene-specific factors
In order to incorporate the gene—specific factors of replication timing
and expression level into the background mutation model, external

estimates of replication timing were first obtained from Chen et al.
(2010), who sequenced the DNA from HeLa cell lines at various
stages of the synthesis phase of the cell cycle and provided timing es—
timates over 100 kb windows across the entire genome. As a robust
proxy for replication timing, we divided the genome into three equal
parts: (i) Early, (ii) Middle and (iii) Late replicating regions by split—
ting on the tertiles of the observed distribution. This is desirable
since replication timing is not perfectly correlated across cell types,
and we do not have ovarian cell line data. However, we note that
the implementation of MADGiC is ﬂexible enough to accommodate
other sources of replication timing data.

Next, average expression levels of each gene were obtained from
the 91 cell lines in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) data—
base with RNA—seq data (Barretina et (11., 2012), and genes were div—
ided into tertiles of expression. Averages across many tissue types in
the CCLE were used rather than matched expression measurements
from TCGA since the pattern of decreased mutations with increased
expression was more stable within mutation type, and because this
same set of expression data could be used in studies of a different
cancer or in studies where expression data was not available.
However, as with replication timing data, if other sources of expres—
sion data are available, they may be specified in the MADGiC
package.

Let in, n 6 {1,2,3} be the relative rates of mutation for a pos—
ition in replication timing category 71, and let 8),, 17 6 {1,2, 3} be the
relative rates of mutation for a position in expression level category
17. In addition, let 5 be the relative rate of mutation for olfactory
genes compared to all others. These parameters are incorporated
into the background model of YS as additional multiplicative fac—
tors. They are in addition to the mutation—type and nucleotide con—
text—specific rate parameters pm, m : 1, . . . , 8 defined in the YS
model.

2.3.2 Parameter estimation

Recall that the relative rate parameter estimates 0,", 2”, E), and 5 de—
termine background mutation rate probabilities and thus, ideally,
they should be obtained by fitting the model only to genes contain—
ing silent mutations. Using all genes would mean that driver genes
are included, which would violate our assumption that driver genes
do not follow the background mutation model. However, because
indels are non—silent, we also include genes that have at most one
non—silent mutation. This introduces potential selection bias in the
sample—specific mutation rates qi so we follow YS and introduce an—
other parameter r to account for the bias.

As in YS, we use the method of moments to estimate the relative
rate parameters for mutation type pm and selection bias r, as well as
the additional parameters in, 8;, and 5. We obtain empirical Bayes
estimates of the sample—specific overall mutation rates qi (by assign—
ing the prior distribution of q,- to be Uniform(a, b) and estimating
the posterior mean). The hyperparameters (é,  are found via
maximum likelihood estimation given relative rate parameters

—t

(f, 1:, A, E and 5). In this way, the posterior distribution of q,-
depends on the observed mutations in sample /, as well as the data—
wide parameter estimates of the relative rates of the different types
of mutations. Finally, the background probability big that a gene g is
mutated in sample / under the background model (i.e. given g is a
passenger) is approximated by summing the probability of a back—
ground mutation across all base pairs in the gene. Note that this pro—
cedure is different from YS, who calculate big as the expectation
with respect to the posterior distribution of 11,; the resulting esti—
mates of big using YS are also empirical Bayes estimates and are very

similar to the estimates obtained by our procedure, except that the
former requires ] >r< G numerical integrations and the latter only ]
which provides considerable improvement in computation time.

2.4 Implementation and evaluation

In order to evaluate the utility of incorporating functional impact
scores in the model, as well as assess what could be gained with a
score that was better able to distinguish between passenger and
driver mutations, MADGiC was evaluated under three different
functional impact profiles: (i) ignoring functional impact, (ii) realis—
tic impact—SIFT score profiles (see Supplementary Section S4 for
details) and (iii) high impact—passenger scores drawn from
Beta(1,1.5) and driver scores set equal to one. The last represents
some idealistic functional impact (FI) scoring system in which the
distributions of driver and passenger scores are well—separated (i.e.
passenger mutations tend to have low functional impact and driver
mutations always have high functional impact) and is designed to as—
sess the upper bound for the amount of improvement than can be
achieved by incorporating F1. The background model was fit as
described in Section 2.3 and the posterior probabilities of each gene
being a driver were computed as described in Section 2.2. Genes
with posterior probability greater than 0.95 were classified as
drivers.

For comparison, the frequency—based methods YS (original ver—
sion) and MutSigCV (version 1.3) were also evaluated (YS evaluated
for only 50 simulations due to computation time). Genes were classi—
fied as drivers by YS or MutSigCV if the Benjamini—Hochberg ad—
justed P value was less than 0.05. MuSiC was not evaluated since it
requires a post—processing step to filter the output, for which general
guidelines are not provided by Dees et al. (2012); and OncodriveFM
and OncodriveCLUST (using Intogen suite version 2.4.1) were only
evaluated for the case study data since it is not possible to specify
simulated SIFT scores for these approaches. For the Oncodrive
methods, we considered genes with q—values less than 0.05.

While we can comment on the characteristic differences among
the driver genes identified in the case studies, it should be noted that
we do not have a list of ‘true positive’ driver genes for the ovarian or
lung cancer data. As a proxy, we use the list of 125 genes identified
as drivers by Vogelstein et al. (2013). Note that although some
hyperparameters in MADGIC were estimated using COSMIC data
(see Section 2.2.3), the TCGA ovarian and lung datasets were
removed prior to estimation, and no information regarding the list
of drivers in Vogelstein et al. (2013) was used. Further, a sensitivity
analysis was conducted to examine the effect of the weight placed
on COSMIC in assigning prior probabilities that a gene is a driver
(see Supplementary Section S3).

3 Results

3.1 Application to simulated data

To facilitate comparisons with existing methods, the simulation
study considers two types of simulations: SIM I simulations that
ignore the dependence of mutation rate on replication timing and
expression level and SIM II simulations that do not. Within each
simulation setup, we evaluate the ability of MADGiC and compet—
ing methods to identify true driver genes in a scenario that mimics
TCGA ovarian (with a relatively large sample size and average num—
ber of mutations) as well as one that mimics TCGA lung (relatively
small sample size and large number of mutations). In addition,
MADGiC was evaluated under three different functional impact set—
tings in order to assess to what degree the inclusion of an F1 score

may result in increased power. As expected, performance depends
on each of these characteristics.

As shown in Table 2, false discovery rate (FDR) is well con—
trolled for all methods when mutation rate is assumed constant
across replication timing region and expression level. In the more
realistic SIM II setting, FDR increases for methods that do not
accommodate this dependence. For the simulated lung data, FDRs
are generally higher and power is generally lower for all methods.
This is likely due in part to the higher passenger mutation rate rela—
tive to the true driver mutation rate as well as greater heterogeneity
in sample—specific mutation rates.

When functional impact scores are able to separate driver muta—
tions from passengers (the ideal FI case), MADGiC is very well pow—
ered to detect true driver genes and has a well—controlled FDR. In
contrast, when no FI information is used, the power of MADGiC is
decreased but is still highest among approaches using the ovarian—
based simulations, with only moderate increases in FDR. In the
lung—based simulations, YS has higher power than MADGiC, but
the FDR is considerably inﬂated. Under the more intermediate FI
setting that is based on observed SIFT score profiles, MADGiC has
more power than when FI information is ignored, with comparable
FDR. Thus, MADGiC performs best when FI scores are set to be
near ideal, however, it still shows favorable performance when SIFT
scores are used (and also when no F1 is used).

3.2 Application to TCGA somatic mutation data

3.2.1 Ovarian cancer

MADGiC identified 19 genes with a posterior probability of being
a driver greater than 0.95 (listed in Supplementary Section S5).
Table 3 (top) displays the number of genes found by each method,
along with the proportion of those found that were also on the list
of putative drivers from Vogelstein et al. (2013) (the ‘Putative
Driver Rate’). YS identified 70 significant genes after adjustment for
multiple comparisons, 14 of which were also found by our model.
MutSigCV identified five significant genes after adjustment for mul—
tiple comparisons, two of which were identified by our model and
YS. Six of the 21 genes identified by OncodriveFM and three of the
20 genes identified by OncodriveCLUST were also found by
MADGiC. We note that 57.9% of the drivers identified by our
model are contained in the list from Vogelstein et al. (2013), while

simulations was designed to mimic TCGA ovarian data, which has a relatively
large sample size, an average number of mutations and relatively little vari—
ability among sample-speciﬁc mutation rates; the second set is based on
TCGA lung data, with smaller sample size, larger number of mutations and
greater heterogeneity in sample-speciﬁc mutation rates.

the same figure is 12.9% for YS, 40.0% for MutSigCV, 38.1% for
OncodriveFM and 25.0% for OncodriveCLUST. Of the five genes
identified by MADGiC but not YS, four have five or fewer mutated
samples and two of those are putative drivers.

Figure 3 displays the proportion of genes found by each method
in each replication timing and expression level category. Here we
see that MADGiC is not biased toward finding genes in the high
background mutation categories (late replication timing or low ex—
pression) compared to the distribution of all genes. In contrast, YS
finds the highest proportion of genes in the high mutation rate
categories.

3.2.2 Squamous cell lung carcinoma

Although the lung data set is structurally different than ovarian with
a smaller sample size and much higher average mutation rate, the
qualitative results from each method are similar. MADGiC identi—
fied 47 genes with a posterior probability of being a driver greater
than 0.95 (listed in Supplementary Section S5). Table 3 (bottom) dis—
plays the number of genes found by each method, along with the
proportion of those found that was also on the list of putative driv—
ers from Vogelstein et al. (2013). YS identified 5 85 significant genes
after adjustment for multiple comparisons, 45 of which were also
found by our model. MutSigCV identified seven significant genes
after adjustment for multiple comparisons, six of which were identi—
fied by MADGiC and YS. Eight of the 85 genes identified by
OncodriveFM and seven of the 55 genes identified by
OncodriveCLUST were also found by MADGiC. We note that
21.3% of the drivers identified by our model are contained in the
list from Vogelstein et al. (2013), while the same figure is 1.9% for
YS, 57.1% for MutSigCV, 15.3% for OncodriveFM and 14.5% for
OncodriveCLUST. As in the ovarian case study, YS is biased toward
identifying genes in the high background mutation rate categories
(see Supplementary Section S5 for details). Specifically, of the 448
genes significant only by YS that also have complete replication tim—
ing and expression information, 400 (89%) are in either the late rep—
licating region, the low expression category or both. In addition,
only one of these additional genes was also identified by Vogelstein
et al. (2013). Of the two genes identified by MADGiC but not YS,
one has five or fewer mutated samples and the other is a putative
driver.

Note that the results presented here for MutSigCV are slightly
different than those observed in Lawrence et al. (2013) since we
have removed 10 samples, used a q—value threshold of 0.05 instead
of 0.10 and used the most updated version of MutSigCV (see
Sections 2.1.2 and 2.4 for details).

4 Discussion

MADGiC is an integrative model that provides posterior probabil—
ities for improved inference for driver gene identification. The em—
pirical Bayesian framework provides a natural way to incorporate
several critical features together that were previously only con—
sidered in isolation. In addition to modeling key features of the
observed mutation data, MADGiC also leverages the non—random
mutational patterns observed across many cancer types in the
COSMIC database to inform the prior probability of driver
activity. Until recently, these spatial patterns were only evident
in well—studied cancer genes that were the focus of targeted
sequencing studies. Over the past few years, however, the
COSMIC database has accumulated data from thousands of
whole genomes and whole exomes, enabling a systematic search
over all genes. The use of a database that collects mutation position
data from multiple studies for each cancer type is vital, as the char—
acteristic spatial patterns observed across thousands of cancers are
not discernible when analyzing data from a single cancer in
isolation.

The performance of MADGiC shows promise both in simula—
tions and case studies. The simulation studies suggest that MADGiC
has favorable operating characteristics relative to existing methods,
and further highlights specifically the amount of advantage gained
by incorporating functional impact scores. As the quality of these
scores improves, so too should the power of MADGiC. In addition,
the simulation study demonstrates that the operating characteristics
of all approaches can vary widely with sample size, mutation fre—
quency and heterogeneity in sample—specific mutation rates. It also
demonstrates that MADGiC’s integration of data across multiple
sources facilitates the identification of putative driver genes showing
relatively few mutations, a result also observed in the case studies.
Specifically, as seen in Supplementary Tables S7 and S8, there are
several genes with only three to five samples mutated that are identi—
fied as drivers by MADGiC but not other approaches. The fact that
many of these are also on the putative driver list of Vogelstein et al.
(2013) suggests that they are not false positives.

A limitation of all methods investigated stems from our assump—
tion that the somatic mutation calls are complete and accurate.
While it has been observed that properties of tumor samples (e.g.
low allelic fraction) are responsible for introducing systematic
sequencing bias, methods for improving the sensitivity of mutation
callers have been developed (Yost et al., 2013). As these methods
continue to improve, so too will results from MADGiC. A further
limitation of frequency—based methods that was noted in Lawrence
et al. (2013) is the bias toward longer genes. Although MADGiC,
YS and MutSigCV each account for gene length, the driver genes are
still enriched for longer genes in all three methods in both case stud—
ies except for MutSigCV in the lung cancer study (see
Supplementary Section S5 for details). However, MutSigCV is more
conservative than the other two methods and the bias reappears as
the gene list size increases. The bias is likely a result of additional,
perhaps unknown factors that affect the rate of mutation of these
longer genes. The fact that none of the methods are able to com—
pletely overcome this bias demonstrates that this is an ongoing chal—
lenge for frequency—based methods.

So far, we have only considered modeling one gene at a time.
Thus, when computing the posterior probability that a given gene is
a driver, no information pertaining to any other genes is considered,
beyond that used to estimate the parameters in the background mu—
tation model. However, a non—silent mutation in any one of a group
of coordinately regulated genes (e.g. A, B and C) could cause the
same selective advantage to a cancer cell. In this situation, evidence
of driver activity of gene A would increase given non—silent muta—
tions in genes B and C in other samples. A number of methods are
available for identifying pathways containing driver genes (Ciriello
et al., 2012; Vaske et al., 2010; Vandin et al., 2012). Extensions of
MADGiC to accommodate pathway structure should further im—
prove our ability to identify drivers of cancer.

Ratheesh Kumar et al.

 

et al., 2009) to identify domain architecture and associated func—
tional motifs of HSPs. The secondary structural assignments
were done using PSIPRED Version 3.2 (McGufﬁn et al.,
2000), and subcellular localization and signal peptide regions
were predicted using TargetP (Emanuelsson et al., 2007;
Nielsen et al., 1997), WolfPsort (Horton et al., 2007) and Psort
(Nakai and Horton, 1999).

Taxon information of each organism was obtained from
NCBI Taxonomy database (Benson et al., 2011). Gene ontolo—
gies were inferred from UniProtKB (The UniProt Consortium,
2012). Experimentally determined 3D structures were retrieved
from the PDB (Berman et al., 2000). Available literature refer—
ences were generated from PubMed; the cross—references and
identiﬁers of external databases were also imported.

3 DATABASE IMPLEMENTATION

HSPIR is built using open source MySQL database and inter—
faced with server—side PHP scripts. The Web interface uses dy—
namically generated HTML pages supported by JavaScript and
CSS to provide an interactive environment for public access.
Perl—CGI scripts have been used to compile the BLAST,
CLUSTALW and hidden Markov model search features
(Eddy, 1998).

4 DATABASE INTERFACE AND VISUALIZATION

HSPIR is a user—friendly Web resource in which the homepage
provides a model of functional networks of six major HSP
families (Supplementary Figure S2). Each of them is mapped
with a dedicated Web page explaining their structure, domain
organization, classiﬁcation and physiological significance with
diagrammatic illustrations.

4.1 Search features

HSPIR incorporates four different search features. Basic key—
word search allows ﬁnding of HSPs based on their names (in—
cludes gene names, standardized and synonymous names),
families, identiﬁers (HSPIR and external) and classiﬁcations.
The advanced search is our key feature, which narrows the
search criteria for speciﬁc and better results. Users are able to
reﬁne their search using the combined search method with logical
and relational operators dynamically organized on the page. The
data retrieval can be further streamlined using other specialized
query tools such as genome—wide search and domain—based
search. These tools can query database independently to retrieve
records based on a speciﬁc genome, speciﬁed combination of
domains.

4.2 Results

Results of all the search tools are presented in the form of a
paginated table. Protein records can be viewed by clicking the
accession ID, or have been added to the HSPIR cart for down—
loading and further analysis. Individual protein records comprise
names and lineage, classiﬁcation, sequence information, domains
and motifs, structures, ontologies, references, cross—references,
external links to different databases and, finally, the protein
record information.

4.3 Sequence comparison

BLAST stand—alone package implemented in the database allows
the users to search for a query protein against HSPIR database
and identify similar HSP sequences. Comparing of multiple se—
quences can be done using CLUSTALW, and the tree is visua—
lized using Archaeopteryx.

4.4 HSP identification

The HSP identiﬁcation tool allows the user to identify and clas—
sify unknown sequences into a particular HSP family. The
user—provided sequence is scanned against predeﬁned HSP
libraries of proﬁles created from a set of validated seed sequences
(Supplementary Table S1).

5 SUMMARY AND FUTURE PRESPECTIVES

The scope of HSPIR is to provide a dedicated resource for HSPs
with functional annotations. The interactive search features with
collated information provided in the database will allow re—
searchers to perform comparative analysis and explore additional
physiological functions of HSPs in different species, which was
not well appreciated previously. Moreover, the data in the
HSPIR will be checked for updates weekly, using PHP scripts
and parsers scheduled by crontab. These updated records will be
reviewed and uploaded by the curation team. The future perspec—
tive is to incorporate HSP information for additional genomes,
with a special emphasis on pathogenic species. We will include
other specialized chaperones like disulﬁde isomerases, accessory
proteins such as nucleotide exchange factors, prefoldins and
HSP90 co—chaperones.

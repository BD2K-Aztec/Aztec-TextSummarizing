browser sessions and custom tracks in the same manner as other
tracks, and the underlying data can be viewed, manipulated and
downloaded using the UCSC Table Browser (Karolchik et al.,
2004).

2 IMPLEMENTATION

Complete information about setting up a track data hub is avail—
able at http: / / genome .ucsc.edu/ goldenPath/ help /hgTrackHub
Help.html. A hub requires three components: one or more
datasets formatted in a compressed binary format supported
by the Genome Browser, a set of text ﬁles that specify properties
for the track data hub and for each of the data tracks within it
and a server with Internet access to host the data and text ﬁles.
The data files underlying a track do not have to reside in the
same track hub directory or server as the text files, but they must
be accessible through the Internet.

The Genome Browser currently supports the compressed
binary formats BigWig, BigBed, BAM and VCF/tabix, described
in detail at http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformathtml. The
Linux binaries needed to set up a track data hub are provided by
UCSC at http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/.

The BigWig format is ideal for viewing continuous value plot
data, such as read depths from short read sequencing projects or
levels of conservation observed in a multiple—species alignment.
BigWig files contain lists of chromosome segments that may be
displayed as a bar or line graph. Although each BigWig ﬁle
contains only a single value for any given base, BigWig tracks
are often combined into a ‘multiWig’ display that allows multiple
BigWig files to be overlaid on the same axis.

BigBed format, which is the binary indexed version of browser
extensible data format, is useful for associating a name and (op—
tionally) a color, a score and additional user—deﬁned data with
one or more related regions on the same chromosome, such as all
the exons of a gene.

BAM files, binary versions of Sequence Alignment/ Map
(SAM) format ﬁles, consist of alignments of DNA reads (gener—
ally short) to a reference sequence, usually a complete genome.
Unlike BigWig and BigBed formats, the BAM ﬁle index is con—
tained in a separate .bai ﬁle in the same directory and with the
same root ﬁle name.

VCF ﬁles can contain annotations of single nucleotide vari—
ants, insertions/deletions, copy number variants, structural vari—
ants or other types of genomic variation. They must be
compressed and indexed using tabix (http://sourceforge.net/pro—
jects/samtools/files/tabix/). Like BAM index ﬁles, the separate
tabix—formatted .tbi index ﬁle must be included in the same dir—
ectory as the compressed VCF file and must have the same root
ﬁle name.

In addition to the data files, each track data hub requires a
directory containing a minimum of three text ﬁles: a hub.txt ﬁle
that deﬁnes the labels used to describe the hub, a genomes.txt ﬁle
that describes the assemblies supported by the hub and a
tracka.txt ﬁle that describes the data files and defines their
display attributes.

The tracka.txt file, which is based on the Genome Browser
.ra format, is the most complex of the text ﬁles in the hub dir—
ectory. It contains a collection of stanzas, one for each data ﬁle
in a given assembly, that deﬁne the display and conﬁguration

properties for each track or group of tracks (in the case of com—
posite or super—tracks). The Track Database Deﬁnition docu—
ment (http: / / genome. ucsc.edu/ goldenPath/ help /tracka / track
DbHub.html) provides details about how to declare the dataset
display settings and values used in tracka.txt.

Optionally, each track in the hub may also have an HTML—
formatted description ﬁle that provides detailed information
about the data, such as the methods used to produce and validate
the data, background information, display conventions, acknow—
ledgments and reference publications.

Once constructed, a track data hub can be imported into the
Genome Browser for viewing by entering the URL of the hub.txt
file on the ‘My Hubs’ tab of the track data hubs web page (http://
genome.ucsc.edu/cgi—bin/thubConnect). The Genome Browser
track data hub import utility supports Internet protocols such as
http://, https://, and (less efﬁciently) ftp://, as well as ﬁle paths
relative to the hub directory hierarchy.

A track data hub may be shared with others by providing the
URL of the hub.txt file needed to load the hub. Hubs of general
interest to the research community can be registered at UCSC for
sharing on the Genome Browser Web site by contacting the
browser technical support mailing list at genome@soe.ucsc.edu
(include the URL of the hub.txt ﬁle in the message). Links to
registered shared hubs may be found on the ‘Public Hubs’ tab on
the Genome Browser track data hubs web page (http://genome.
ucsc.edu/cgi—bin/thubConnect).

3 CONCLUSIONS

Track data hubs provide a convenient efﬁcient mechanism for
importing collections of large personal datasets into the UCSC
Genome Browser for browsing, analysis and sharing with the
research community. We are working with other genomics
tools providers, such as Ensembl (Flicek et al., 2013), to stand—
ardize the track data hub interface and add support for
hub displays on other genome—browsing platforms. Future
plans include extending the browser’s track search mechanism
to work with hubs, expanding the ﬂexibility of track data
hub organization and conﬁguration in the browser, providing
more sample files and a wizard program to facilitate track data
hub construction and adding support for more data types.
Recently UCSC has also added support for assembly data
hubs, which enable individuals to easily extend the Genome
Browser to display genome assemblies not included in the
browser database.

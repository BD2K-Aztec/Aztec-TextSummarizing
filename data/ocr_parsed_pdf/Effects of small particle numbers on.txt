ABSTRACT

Motivation: The functioning of many biological processes depends on
the appearance of only a small number of a single molecular species.
Additionally, the observation of molecular crowding leads to the insight
that even a high number of copies of species do not guarantee their
interaction. How single particles contribute to stabilizing biological
systems is not well understood yet. Hence, we aim at determining
the influence of single molecules on the long-term behaviour of biolo-
gical systems, i.e. whether they can reach a steady state.

Results: We provide theoretical considerations and a tool to analyse
Systems Biology Markup Language models for the possibility to sta-
bilize because of the described effects. The theory is an extension of
chemical organization theory, which we called discrete chemical or-
ganization theory. Furthermore we scanned the BioModels Database
for the occurrence of discrete chemical organizations. To exemplify
our method, we describe an application to the Template model of the
mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint mechanism.

1 INTRODUCTION

Systems biology heavily relies on the precise language of reaction
networks (RNs) to describe many different processes in cells and
other living systems in a formal way (Kitano, 2002; Klipp et al.,
2009). Molecules and reactions can be expressed in an explicit or
implicit way (Danos and Laneve, 2004). These descriptions of the
network only capture the static part of the model. Additionally
the reactor, i.e. a collection of molecules, and the dynamics, i.e.
how to apply reactions to a reactor, have to be speciﬁed.

There are many different ways to model the dynamics of the
application of rules in a chemical system. To approximate the
inherently stochastic evolution of chemical systems typically
ordinary diﬂ’erential equations (ODEs) are in use (Dittrich et al.
2001). In this case, one assumes that a huge or even infinite
amount of particles is present so that it is reasonable to
assume continuous amounts, or more precisely, concentrations.
Furthermore, usually a well-stirred reactor and time constant

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

reaction rates as well as a sequential application of rules are
presumed. Depending on the type of system different kinetics
like mass action (Connors, 1990) or MichaelisiMenten kinetics
(Michaelis and Menten, 1913) can be used.

When looking at qualitative properties, we are often interested
in the long-term behaviour, i.e. the ﬁnal states that the system is
able to reach. In continuous dynamical systems, given by the
ODEs, ﬁxed points and limit cycles represent the ﬁnal states of
the system. Chemical organization theory (COT) (Dittrich and di
Fenizio, 2007) was developed to better understand the long-term
behaviour of chemical system by introducing chemically more
relevant aspects and notions. Based on concepts of organization
in biology (Fontana and Buss, 1994), COT was developed to deal
with constructive systems, i.e. systems in which new species
appear and stay over a longer period. So far, COT was applied
successfully in various areas like chemical computing
(Matsumaru et al., 2007), social systems (Dittrich and Winter,
2005), evolutionary game theory (V eloz et al., 2014), HIV dy-
namics (Matsumaru et al., 2006) or checking systems biology
models for inconsistencies (Kaleta et al., 2009). The theoretical
results are based on the continuous dynamics and include the
observation that in every ﬁxed point there is a chemical organ-
ization (Dittrich and di Fenizio, 2007; Peter and Dittrich, 2011).

Nevertheless their usefulness, the benefit to use differential
equations with a rich arsenal of methods to find such solutions
is ﬁnally limited by the fact that particle numbers are ﬁnite.
Hence, obviously not all properties of a system’s behaviour can
be detected. Cao and Liang (2008); Schultz et al. (2007) already
made some efforts to analyse small stochastic networks by ana-
lysing effects of small numbers of molecules on the stability of
switches and by proposing an algorithm to enumerate the state
space for spaces with small copy numbers with a limited number
of newly produced molecules, respectively. Ramaswamy et a].
(2012) discovered that for small sizes of reactors, the ratio be-
tween the amounts of species in steady state can change, and
hence, called this effect “discreteness-induced inversion effect”.

The inherent stochasticity of the dynamics in chemical systems
gives rise to well-established models like the algorithm developed
by Gillespie (1976, 1977). There the update of the molecules is
based on the fact that the occurrence of a reaction depends solely
on the abundance of molecules necessary for ﬁring the reaction.
Even though stochastic dynamics are much closer to a realistic
system, there are additional phenomena that are mostly not

considered in these standard models. Fedoroff and Fontana
(2002) examine the effect of stochasticity, noise and small num-
bers of macromolecules and also pose the question “So how do
organisms manageiand perhaps even capitalize onimolecular
noise?” Halling (1989) even asks “Do the laws of chemistry apply
to living cells?” In other words, are the generally used settings for
chemistry, described above as the assumptions for the ODE
system, correct for a living cell?

After the initial observation of molecular crowding in cells
(Laurent, 1963; Laurent and Ogston, 1963), recently, even the
tracking of single molecule production is possible (Elf et al.,
2007; Yu et al., 2006). They discovered that proteins are produced
in bursts from single messenger RNA molecules. Becskei et al.
(2005) show how low molecule numbers change gene expression.
Reviews on macromolecular crowding and conﬁnement are pre-
sented in (Zhou et al., 2008; Zimmerman and Minton, 1993). On
the theoretical side, there is the idea of fractal kinetics (Kopelman,
1988), and how macromolecular crowding implies these fractal
kinetics (Schnell and Turner, 2004). Other inﬂuences of the geom-
etry by the kinetics are given in (Bénichou et al., 2010).

In this article, we put an emphasis on two aspects, which we
call particle eﬁ’ect, of discrete systems. First, a small amount of
molecules of one or more species present in the reaction vessel
has an effect on the dynamical long-term behaviour of the
system. Second, the limitation of number of molecules in the
reaction vessel is considered. We aim to detect the ability of
RNs to stabilize because of the impact of small molecular
number or ﬁnite reactor size. This can be achieved by extending
the theory of chemical organizations.

For the extension, we look at the system in a discrete way, i.e.
there is no concentration of molecules, but rather a discrete
amount of them. This leads to discrete states and transitions
between them given by possible sequences of reactions. The dy-
namics usable with this theory was chosen as general as possible,
including mass action, MichaelisiMenten and maximal parallel-
ism (Krepska et al., 2008). However, only the simplest model
assuming one transition per reaction will be used in the main
text. This setup yields a Markov chain model on a transition
graph. Similar to COT, the deﬁnition of discrete organizations
is based on the closure and self-maintenance properties. These
two notions can be adapted to a discrete setup. All continuous
organizations are found to be discrete chemical organizations as
well. This makes the extension sound. The discrete organizations
correspond to particular steady states, which we identiﬁed as
caused by the described particle effects.

To distinguish between the so far developed continuous COT
and the discrete one, we denote it by discrete chemical organisa-
tion theory (DOT). For the introduction of all the necessary no-
tions in COT and Markov chains, we refer to Supplementary
Sections 1 and 2, respectively. We deﬁne discrete organizations
in Section 2.2. A characterisation via communication class in
Supplementary Section 3 then establishes properties for small
sizes of reactor vessels. For RNs with special structural proper-
ties, stronger results hold, see Supplementary Section 4. Finally
we use our findings to examine the Template model of the mi-
totic spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) mechanism in Section
3.2. We use a Java implementation, which is also available
online. With its help, we scanned the BioModels Database

(Chelliah et al., 2013) for the existence of discrete organizations,
see Section 3.1.

2 METHODS
2.1 RNs and transition graphs

A RN consists Of a set Of molecular species and a set Of reactions, which
are interactions among molecules that lead to the appearance or dis-
appearance Of molecules.

DEFINITION 1. Let M be a set and R be a subset of RmultUVl) x 73mm(M)
where 73mm(M) denotes the set of multisets over M. The pair (M, R) is
called RN, and we call M the set of molecules and R the set of reactions.

By applying or firing a reaction (I, r) e R to a multiset s, also called a
state, over M, we mean replacing the subset l by the subset r in s. The
stoichiometric coefﬁcients Of (l, r) are lM. We assume that the multiset
considered is always large enough, i.e. that it consists Of enough molecules
as required on the left hand Of the rule, otherwise the reaction is not
applicable. Also, we will assume a maximal reactor size or maximal
size Of state Nmax later in Our considerations; a rule cannot be applied
if the resulting multiset exceeds the maximum. A limited reactor size also
means a ﬁnite state space. We will use the notations from multiset theory
and write (I, r)(s)=s — l-i-r for the result Of applying a reaction to a
multiset.

A subset C of M being closed means that by applying all reactions
possible in C to multisets over C we do not get molecules outside C. A
subset S of M being self-maintaining means that reactions able to ﬁre in S
can occur at certain strictly positive rates to a multiset over M without
reducing the number Of molecules Of any species Of S.

DEFINITION 2. A subset of M is a chemical organization if it is closed and
self-maintaining.

The set Of all states s, i.e. multisets Of species, is called state space; see
Figure 3 for an example. We call a set Of states c a part of the state space
and deﬁne the molecules present in states Of the part as M(c). We also
use this notation for species, i.e. M(s)=M({s}). Analogously, the reac-
tions ﬁring in a part c are denoted Re.

The following deﬁnitions are adopted from Markov chain theory; see
for example (Brémaud, 1999), p. 56, and p. 71.

DEFINITION 3 (Transition graph). The transition graph is a directed graph
with the states as nodes and edges from a state s to a state 5  there is a
transition, i.e. a sequence of reactions R(s, 5) transforming s to 5.

DEFINITION 4 (Accessible set). A state 5 is said to be accessible from state s
if there is a path from s to 5. The set of states accessible from s is called
accessible set from s and denoted Acc(s).

2.2 Particle effects and discrete organizations

Dynamical models Of RNs mostly use ODEs to describe the change in
concentration Of the molecular species over time. Because concentrations
are a continuous abstraction Of the actual amounts Of molecules present,
we are interested in the cases that the actual number inﬂuences the
Observed behaviour. The motivation for deﬁning discrete organizations
is so-called particle effects, which are the consequences Of using discrete
molecule numbers. They occur in two different cases.

The ﬁrst case happens if there are too few particles to start a reaction,
e.g. when there are reactions in the network where at least one reactant
species M has a stoichiometric coefﬁcient lM> 1. Then, this reaction
cannot ﬁre if the amount Of M is lower than I M. When using concentra-
tions to describe the amount Of M, the effects Of the not ﬁring are not
captured; see Figure 1. Taking the naive approach to just compute the

solutions Of the equations given by mass action kinetics leads to predict-
ing a long-term behaviour Of the concentrations, which is not possible in a
real chemical system with a limited amount Of molecules.

The second case occurs if the reactor is nearly full, because Of the limita-
tion Of amount Of molecules, reactions might also not occur. In the transition
graph, this is seen in the non-existence Of edges where the amount Of mol-
ecules present in a state suggests that there should be a reaction possible. Also
the long-term behaviour shown in Figure 2 cannot be detected with chemical
organizations or analysis Of the ODEs from mass action kinetics. In the only
ﬁxed point Of the shown RN, the catalysts K1, K2, K3 vanish. Only the
pdorgs, see Deﬁnitions 5 and 6, hint at the possibility to stabilize the
system in a small reactor in a state with all species present.

DEFINITION 5 (Discrete organization, generator). A subset of species D of
M is called discrete organization  there is a state s with

D = M(Acc(s))

and there is a sequence Of transitions (01, . . . , 0k) such that

k
73mm): U U _{(1, r)}

i=1 (l,r)Eo
and s = (oko . . . o 01)(s) satisﬁes

VMEDIEMZSM.

Such a state s is called (internal) generator of the discrete organization.

Our deﬁnition only depends on the topological properties Of the tran-
sition graph, see Deﬁnition 3, underlying the Markov chain and the
topological properties Of the RN. It also does not refer to the capacity
Of the state space. Rather, the deﬁnition is given independently Of the size
Of state space. This makes it possible to talk about a reactor Of unlimited
and limited capacity.

The two requirements correspond to the closure and self-maintenance.
The ﬁrst ensures that we start with the species Of D, and there are no new
species produced or consumed in the whole accessibility set. The second
ensures that there is a path Of transitions using all reactions possible
leading to a state with no less molecules. Of course, one discrete organ-
ization can have several generators; see also Figure 3 for examples.

LEMMA 1 (Self-maintainence and discrete organizations). Consider the
case of one reaction per transition. For a discrete organization D of M
with a generator s the RN

(D, RAoc(s)) = (M (1300(3)), RAcc(s))
is self-maintaining and hence an organization.

PROOF. We can choose a sequence Of transitions or, under the hypothesis,
reactions (01, . . . , 0k) as in the deﬁnition Of discrete organizations above.
Counting the occurrence Of each reaction type in the sequence, we get
positive integer rates for each type Of reaction. These rates show the self-
maintenance.

The newly identiﬁed discrete organizations are consistent with the con-
cept from COT, i.e. every (continuous) organization is a discrete
organization.

LEMMA 2 (Continuous are discrete organization). Consider the case of one
reaction per transition. If the subset O of M is an organization, then there
is a generator s of a discrete organization such that O: M(Acc(s)) and
R0 = RAMS). Therefore, every organization is also a discrete organization.

PROOF. We can choose integer reaction rates for R0, which fulﬁl the self-
maintenance condition for 0. Deﬁne a sequence (01, . . . , 0k) Of reactions
with the multiplicities equal to the rates. We can choose a state s such that
O=M(s), and the multiplicities Of species are big enough so that the
sequence (01, . . . , 0k) can ﬁre.

DEFINITION 6 (Purely discrete organization). The discrete organizations,
which are not found in the continuous theory, are called purely discrete
organizations (pdorg).

From a computation point Of view, if we choose a large enough tran-
sition graph, we will ﬁnd every (continuous) organization. Hence, this
gives a different way Of deﬁning and computing organizations in the
models using discrete molecule numbers. Of course, for most purposes,
this will be considerably slower than existing implementations (Centler
et al., 2008, 2010) because Of the size Of the state space.

We provided two ways Of computing discrete organizations. First, we
can use Deﬁnition 5. Second, we can check the networks (M, R’) for
organizations where R’ is a subset Of R in which we eliminated some Of
the reactions Of higher order. These are then candidates for discrete or-
ganizations. They are only candidates because we do not know whether
there is a suitable generator. A candidate for a generator is given as in the
proof Of Lemma 2.

ponding to mass action kinetics with reaction rates k1 = k3 = k4 = 1,k2 =
1.1 and initial concentrations equal to 0.3 for a time interval from 0 to 100
and 500, respectively. We can see that the concentrations Of all three species
tend to 0, which is also a ﬁxed point Of the dynamics. TO see the particle
effects, we assume a total volume Of molecules equal to 10 and 100 in (C)
and (D), respectively. This means initially 3 or 30 copies, respectively, Of
every species are present. Then, because Of degradation reactions, they
slowly vanish. Once the concentration Of C falls under 0.1 and 0.01, re-
spectively, the destruction reaction 2C —> 0 Of C is switched Off. This hap-
pens approximately at time S and 50 in (C) and (D), respectively. Then, the
system stabilizes in the (purely) discrete organization {A, B, C}; see
Deﬁnitions 5 and 6. This takes Of course much longer in the case Of a
reactor volume Of 100 than 10; therefore, we used a bigger time scale in
(B) and (D)

to mass action kinetics with reaction rates k1 = k2 = k3 = 1, k4 = k5 = k6 = S
and initial concentrations equal to 0.12 for a time interval from 0 to 50.
Under these conditions, the concentrations of the catalysts are the same
over time. We can see that the concentrations of all three catalysts K1, K2
and K3 tend to 0, and the other species A, B and C stabilize at some positive
but distinct values. To see the particle effects when a reactor of limited size
is assumed, we change the set of ODEs once the total sum of all species
concentrations reaches 1. This happens at time 3 approximately. Namely,
the last four reactions transforming pairs of catalysts to four copies of C
are switched off. The resulting curves are shown in (B). Then, the system
stabilizes in the (purely) discrete organization {A, B, C, K1, K2, K3}; see
Deﬁnitions 5 and 6. Furthermore, the catalysts stabilize in a small but
positive concentration, and the species A, B and C tend towards the
same concentration

For a pdorg holds RAW(,Y)QRM(AOC(S». We emphasize the difference
between these two sets. RM(AOC(S» stands for the set of reactions applic-
able, when only considering present species, not their numbers, whereas
RAMS) stands for the set of reactions actually applicable when also con-
sidering multiplicities. There are two possible reasons why these two sets
are not equal.

First, there might not be enough molecules in any state in Acc(s) to
trigger a reaction, e.g. the reaction 4A —> B cannot ﬁre in the state 3A.
This can only occur if at least one species, which occurs with high stoi-
chiometry, has small molecule number. For a pdorg D with a generator s,
we call it of type A if for any reaction (I, r) e R M(S)\Rm, there is a species
M  SM < 

Second, the reactor might be full. This can only occur if at least one
reaction has more molecules on the right hand side than on the left hand
side. Because of reactor size limitations, this overproduction might be
hindered; a transition to larger states might not be possible. We call it
of type B if for any reaction (I, r) e RM(S)\RM holds |(l, r)(s)| >Nmax.

An organization can be of type A as well as type B. The types corres-
pond to the particle effects introduced in Figures 1 and 2. The existence of
a connected pdorg of type A or B means that there is the potential of a
steady state containing exactly these species. For the deﬁnition of type B,
we need to have the possibility to limit the reactor size. Discrete organ-
izations of type A can also exist in a reactor of unlimited size.

This independence of the reactor size makes type A more realistic for a
wider variety of models. We use this notion of type A and B to further
ﬁlter the found pdorgs for their interest and behaviour.

The generalization of a connected chemical organization to the discrete
case is easy to do. If D is a discrete organization, then (D, RAM”) is an
organization in the original sense where s is any generator state for D. Of
course, for different generators, there can occur different RAMS), and
hence, different properties of the network (D, RAM”).

DEFINITION 7 (Connected purely discrete organization). A purely dis-
crete organization D is connected  there is a generator s of D such that
(D, RAM”) is connected as a continuous chemical organization.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Scan of the BioModels Database

The BioModels Database (Chelliah et al., 2013) is a database of
quantitative biological models. At the time of writing, March
2014, it consisted of 490 curated and 595 not curated models
written in the Systems Biology Markup Language (Hucka
et al., 2003). We use this repository to show the appearance of
pdorgs. As in some of the models we found an abundance of
pdorgs, we also use the notion of connected discrete organizations
as an extension of the concept with the analogue name intro-
duced in (Centler et al., 2008). Connectedness is a means to sort
out organizations, which exist because of combinatorial effects;
see Deﬁnition 7.

We scanned all 1085 models in the database and tried to find
all discrete organizations for an NW,x of 10 if possible. For some
models, the computational resources (Intel Core i7 at 3.2GHz
with 12GB of memory) were not sufﬁcient, and within a maximal
runtime of 30min no result was found. Hence, we reduced the
NW,x stepwise from 10 down to 1. The results are listed in
Supplementary Table S1 and can also be found as csv file with
the Supplementary Material. Of course, a model not listed might
still exhibit pdorgs, but we did not find them because of the
restrictions on computation mentioned.

Like this, we found that 206 of the 490 curated models and 75 of
the 595 not curated have pdorgs. Among the curated models with
pdorgs, only one does not exhibit any connected pdorg. All the not
curated models with pdorgs also have at least one connected one.
When considering a reactor of ﬁnite size and hence a state space of
ﬁnite size, there are two causes for the appearance of pdorgs, as
illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. We call these types A and
B pdorgs, respectively; see also end of Section 2.2. Only 21 of the
205 curated models with connected pdorgs show connected pdorgs
of type A. For the 75 not curated models, which exhibit connected
pdorgs, we found only 7 with type A organizations. With the scan of
the BioModels Database, we prove the existence of types A and B
pdorgs in many stored models and hence also show the applicability
of our software tool. Of course, addressing the biological relevance
of the potential to go into steady state due to particle effects has to
be addressed in future efforts.

labels at the transitions are the transition probabilities. There are the pdorgs {A, B, C} with a generator (1, 2, 1), {C} with a generator (0, 0, 1) and {A, B}
with a generator (1, 1,0). The light blue coloured states show the generators of the pdorgs. The grey states show the generators for the rest of

mechanism is conserved from Yeast to Human. The core protein
and complexes are the same but have different concentration and
live in different cell size. The mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC)
composed of Mad2, Bub3, Bule and Cdc20 inhibits the ana-
phase-promoting complex to initiate progression into anaphase.
The molecular mechanism has been studied using systems-level
approach for both Human and partly Yeast (Ibrahim et al.,
2009; Lohel et al., 2009; Ibrahim et al., 2008a,b). These models
considered ODEs and also some spatial but not stochastic ef-
fects. An important pathway in these models is the formation of
a complex called Bub3:BubR1:Cdc20 that is sequestering Cdc20
away and eventually inhibits the initiation of anaphase. For the
full RN, see Figure 4. Our DOT approach shows that the com-
plex Bub3:BubR1:Cdc20 must vanish to get the stable state, and
this process is size limited; see Supplementary Figure S8. This is
the opposite view to the explanation that this complex is kineto-
chore dependent (Reaction 5, switched on or off), which means it
works by an external signal for speciﬁc period to sequester
Cdc20. Our DOT interpretation would be that this complex en-
hances MCC formation and does not need to be kinetochore
controlled. These predictions can inﬂuence the budding yeast
rather than the human model.

4 DISCUSSION

We provided a novel method to predict possible steady states of
biological models due to the occurrence of particle effects. The
theoretical foundation is an extension of COT to discrete sys-
tems. More precisely, we gave the definition of discrete chemical
organizations for transition graphs. This turns out to be a gen-
eralization of the concept of chemical organizations, which was
originally aimed at continuous models. We called the discrete
organizations not found in COT purely discrete. They represent
potential steady states due to particle effects, i.e. effects of small
molecular numbers and/or finite reactor size. The former effect
accounts for the biological phenomena of small numbers of
copies of a molecule, molecular crowding and the spatial distri-
bution of molecules in a cell. The latter effect might seem less
natural than the former because we consider reactors with an
upper bound on the number of molecules they contain.
However, we want to mention two classes of example situations
in which this is a reasonable assumption. First, if we consider
reactions that model an inﬂow, e.g. through channels in a mem-
brane, we can have the situation that inﬂow is blocked because of
the already full inside of the reactor. Second, if we model the
spatial setting in a reactor, we know that single molecules occupy
more space than a complex of molecules.

Fig. 4. Visualization of the SAC model. Eukaryotic cells have evolved a conserved checkpoint mechanism for chromosome segregation, the SAC. This
checkpoint delays anaphase onset and prevents exit from mitosis until all chromosomes are properly attached and have aligned on the mitotic spindle. In
many organisms, an MCC composed of Mad2, Bub3, Bule and Cdc20 inhibits the APC to initiate progression into anaphase. Ibrahim et al. (2009)
have constructed a detailed dynamic model of MCC formation and analysed its quantitative properties. In this model, Mad2-activation at the
kinetochore is commonly seen as the central part of the SAC mechanism. It is known as the “Template model”. According to this model (reactions
R1, R2 and R3), Mad2 in its open conformation (O-Mad2) is recruited to unattached kinetochores by Madl-bound Mad2 in its close conformation (C-
Mad2) to form the ternary complex Mad1:C-Mad2:O-Mad2*. In this complex, O-Mad2* is the “activated” Mad2, i.e. it is stabilized in a conformation
that can interact with Cdc20 to form Cdc20:C-Mad2 (Ibrahim et al., 2008a,b). O-Mad2 can bind to Cdc20 with very low afﬁnity (reaction R6). Bub3
associates quite stably with Bule, which has two binding sites to Cdc20. Binding of the N-terrninal region of Bule to Cdc20 requires prior binding of
Mad2 to Cdc20. Systematically, the Bub3:BubR1 complex binds to Cdc20:CMad2 to form the MCC complex (reaction R4). The other site (residues 490
and 560) of Bule binds Cdc20 tightly regardless of Mad2 being bound to Cdc20. Therefore, Bule can form a ternary complex with Bub3 and Cdc20
(reaction R5). The formation of Bub3:BubR1:Cdc20 is accelerated in the presence of unattached chromosomes and it might be that MCC forms as an

intermediate complex from which O-Mad2 rapidly dissociates

Furthermore, our ﬁndings complement the connection found
between chemical organizations and continuous systems (Peter
and Dittrich, 2011), namely, that organizations play a crucial role
in the long-term behaviour of chemical reaction systems. Similarly,
the theory developed herein might be adjustable to also cover par-
ticle effects on elementary modes (Schuster and Hilgetag, 1994) and
cut sets (Klamt and Gilles, 2004). Because COT is based on the
stoichiometric information of RNs alone, only constellations of
species in the potential steady states are computed. We do not con-
sider information on amounts or ratio of amounts as addressed in
(Ramaswamy et al., 2012). Furthermore, we do not say what the
concentration or amounts in the long run might be.

It is important to remark the connection between DOT and the
study of RNs using Petri Nets (PN) (Murata, 1989; Petri, 1962;
Yen, 2006). Namely, the PN formalism is an abstraction of par-
allel processes and has been shown to be equivalent to the RNs
formalism. Several behavioural properties developed in PN
theory, such as liveness, persistence, deadlock, etc., have shown
to be relevant to the analysis of RNs (Heiner et al., 2008).
Interestingly, both COT and (sur-)T-invariants of PN have been
linked to the analysis of elementary modes (Schuster and Hilgetag,
1994) and cut sets (Klamt and Gilles, 2004) in RNs (Heiner et al.,

2010; Kaleta et al., 2006). However, the definition of self-main-
tenance of COT differs from the definition of sur-T-invariants in
PN theory in the choice of positive and non-negative rates, re-
spectively. Moreover, the notion of closed set of COT has not been
studied in PN theory. Hence, exploring the connections between
DOT and PN might be useful to extend our knowledge of the
long-term behaviour of continuous RNs, already obtained by
COT (Peter and Dittrich, 2011), to the discrete domain.

The analysis of the SAC model in detail hints at the inﬂuence of
a molecular complex on the cell division of Yeast, which was
before not identiﬁed as important. Even though the example of
palindromic DNA we described is merely a toy model, it clearly
shows the inability of the known analysis tools to detect the effect
of the distribution of molecules over space on the long-term be-
haviour. By providing an open-source tool for the search for dis-
crete organizations, we also made it possible to ﬁnd models that
might be inﬂuenced by only a few copies of single molecular spe-
cies. We used the tool to prove the existence of discrete organiza-
tions in many biological examples contained in the BioModels
Database. Especially the appearance of connected pdorgs of
type A is of interest. Also, the limitations of our implementation,
like the runtime, could be addressed in a future effort.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Phenotypic Up-regulated Gene Support Vector Machine
(PUGSVM) is a cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBlGTM)
analytical tool for multiclass gene selection and classification.
PUGSVM addresses the problem of imbalanced class separability,
small sample size and high gene space dimensionality, where
multiclass gene markers are defined by the union of one-
versus-everyone phenotypic upregulated genes, and used by a
well-matched one-versus-rest support vector machine. PUGSVM
provides a simple yet more accurate strategy to identify statistically
reproducible mechanistic marker genes for characterization of
heterogeneous diseases.

1 INTRODUCTION

Microarray gene expression studies provide new opportunities for
the molecular Characterization of heterogeneous diseases (Clarke
et al., 2008; Wang et (11., 2008). Multiclass gene selection is an
imperative task for identifying phenotype-associated mechanistic
genes and achieving accurate diagnostic Classiﬁcations (Liu et al.,
2002). Most existing multiclass gene selection methods heavily
rely on the direct extensions of two-Class gene selection methods
(Dudoit et al., 2002; Golub et (11., 1999). However, simple extensions
of binary discriminant analysis to multiclass gene selection are
suboptimal and not well matched to the unique Characteristics of
a multicategory Classiﬁcation problem. Speciﬁcally, the existing
methods will select gene subsets that preserve the distances of
well-separated Classes, while likely create error-prone large overlap
between neighboring Classes (Loog et al., 2001).

of the method in the Supplementary Material) (Yu et al., 2010), we
select genes that are highly expressed in one phenotype relative to
each of the remaining phenotypes, namely One-Versus-Everyone
Phenotypic Up-regulated Genes (OVEPUG). OVEPUG provides
evenhanded gene resources for discriminating both neighboring
and well-separated Classes, and intends to assure the statistical
reproducibility and biological plausibility of the selected genes.
OVEPUG is well suited for small sample size problems (a concern
with many current microarray datasets). We also implement other
competing peer methods for multiclass gene selection, including
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (Golub et (11., 1999), 1 statistic (t-stat)
(Liu et al., 2002), pooled ratio of between-groups to within-
groups sum of squares (BW) (Dudoit et al., 2002) and SVM-based
recursive feature elimination (SVMRFE) (Li and Yang, 2005).
In the Classiﬁcation component of PUGSVM, we implement the
OVRSVM committee Classiﬁer, which has proved highly successful
in multicategory Classiﬁcations with ﬁnite or limited amounts
of high-dimensional data in real-world applications (Riﬂdn and
Klautau, 2002). We also include several other popular multicategory
Classiﬁers, including k nearest neighborhood (kNN) (Golub et al.,
1999), na'1've Bayes Classiﬁer (NBC) (Liu et al., 2002) and OVOSVM
(Liu et al., 2005).

PUGSVM was developed through the caBIG (cabig.nci.nih.gov)
In Silico Research Centers of Excellence (ISRCE) effort, and offers
users across the broader cancer research community a unique yet
effective tool for identifying multiclass gene markers and predicting
Clinical outcomes in cancer treatment. PUGSVM is an open-source
software package. The Java and Matlab codes and documents
are freely available at the authors’ web site, enabling users to
easily modify the program and add new functions or extensions
(http://www.cbil.ece.vt.edu/caBIG-PUGSVM.htm).

2 DESCRIPTION

2.1 Software

The components of PUGSVM and their input/output relationships
are illustrated in Figure 1. We use caBIG existing tools to load,
preprocess and normalize gene expression data from in-house
(i.e. Georgetown Database of Cancer; GDOC) or public databases

(e.g. caArray, TCGA). The processed data with Class labeling are
fed to the gene selection component. The selected PUGs are then
used to train and test the Classiﬁers for predictive Classiﬁcation. The
output of PUGSVM is a set of gene markers with generalizable
performance.

The OVEPUG and other algorithms in the gene selection
component are implemented in Matlab. We use Matlab compiler
to generate C++ shared function libraries. The OVRSVM algorithm
and other Classiﬁers are implemented in C++ with simple calling
interfaces. The user interface is implemented in Java, and C++
shared libraries are called from Java using the Java Native Interface.
PUGSVM has been tested on Microsoft Windows and Linux
platforms. Users can run PUGSVM directly on a computer without
an installed version of MATLAB.

2.2 Case study

We applied PUGSVM on the benchmark Global Cancer Map
dataset (Ramaswamy et al., 2001) that is widely used for evaluating
multicategory Classiﬁcation algorithms. Besides OVRSVM coupled
with OVEPUGs, the combinations of competing gene selection
methods (SNR, t-stat, BW and SVMRFE) with OVRSVM are also
tested for comparisons. Figure 2 shows that OVEPUGs signiﬁcantly
improves the overall multicategory Classiﬁcation compared to
all other combinations. Furthermore, gene markers selected by
PUGSVM are conﬁrmed to be important tumor-associated genes by
literature survey and our domain experts. For example, the top 10
PUGs associated with prostate cancer include several genes strongly
associated with prostate cancer including prostate-speciﬁc antigen
and its alternatively spliced form 2 and prostatic secretory protein
57. Estrogen receptor or (ESRl), a PUG marker for uterine cancer, is
known to be overexpressed in human uterine cancer, and the Hox7
gene, another PUG marker, is known to contribute to uterine ﬁinction
in cow and mouse models, especially at the onset of pregnancy.
Norway ASCites (NAS) dataset is a unique dataset with samples
taken from ascites. We applied PUGSVM on NAS data and obtained
a signiﬁcantly improved Classiﬁcation performance than competing
methods as shown in Figure 2. Several top-ranking gene products
identiﬁed by OVEPUG have been well established as tumor-type
speciﬁc markers and many of them have been used in Clinical
diagnosis. For example, mucin 16, also known as CA125, is a food
and drug administration (FDA)-approved serum marker to monitor
disease progression and recurrence in ovarian cancer patients. Fatty

this enzyme is amenable for drug targeting using FASN inhibitors,
suggesting that it can be used as a therapeutic target in breast cancer.

3 DISCUSSION

PUGSVM is a comprehensive open-source tool that consists
of interconnected components for multiclass gene selection and
predictive Classiﬁcation. The core algorithms in the package are
OVEPUG and OVRSVM, which address several critical yet subtle
issues in molecular Characterization of heterogeneous diseases
for both biological research and Clinical applications. PUGSVM
emphasizes the statistical reproducibility of the selected gene
markers under small sample size, supported by their biologically
plausible interpretations. Several competing gene selection and
Classiﬁcation methods are also incorporated into the package to
demonstrate the superior performance of PUGSVM via objective
comparisons.

Through the caBIG ISRCE effort, we plan to adapt PUGSVM
to identify gene markers as druggable targets and predict breast
cancer resistance and recurrence after tamoxifen treatment. We have
established several workﬂow pipelines for using PUGSVM. For
example, we ﬁrst download breast cancer gene expression datasets
from TCGA and G-DOC, and then normalize and label the data using
caBIG tools, such as GenePattern. We feed the processed data to
PUGSVM. The gene candidates identiﬁed by PUGSVM will be sent
to VIsual Statistical Data Analyzer for visualization, mapping onto
known signaling pathways and further analysis. We are currently
working to create Taverna workﬂow modules for all analyses and
making them publicly available to the cancer community.

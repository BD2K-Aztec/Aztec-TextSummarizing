ABSTRACT

Summary: The R package EasyStrata facilitates the evaluation and
visualization of stratified genome-wide association meta-analyses
(GWAMAs) results. It provides (i) statistical methods to test and ac-
count for between-strata difference as a means to tackle gene—strata
interaction effects and (ii) extended graphical features tailored for stra-
tified GWAMA results. The software provides further features also suit-
able for general GWAMAs including functions to annotate, exclude or
highlight specific loci in plots or to extract independent subsets of loci
from genome-wide datasets. It is freely available and includes a user-
friendly scripting interface that simplifies data handling and allows for
combining statistical and graphical functions in a flexible fashion.
Availability: EasyStrata is available for free (under the GNU General
Public License v3) from our Web site www.genepi-regensburg.de/
easystrata and from the CRAN R package repository cram-project.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genome-wide association meta-analyses (GWAMAs), in which
multiple study-speciﬁc genome-wide association (GWA) results
are pooled, have resulted in a 10- to 20-fold increase in the
number of known genes contributing to complex traits and dis-
eases (Visscher et al., 2012). Meanwhile, a focus is also on gene-
environment-wide interaction analyses (GEWIS) that are con-
ducted to further characterize genetic main effects as well as to
discover novel genetic associations that are only present under
certain environmental conditions (genePenVironment interaction,
GxE). Although some GEWIS have already extended from
single-study analyses to meta-analyses, so far, only few reported
replicable GxE effects (Hutter et al., 2013). For categorical en-
vironmental factors E, GEWIS meta-analyses can be

implemented as GWAMAs stratified by E, for example, a
GWAMA stratiﬁed by sex or by smoking status. Stratiﬁed
GWAMAs do not only improve power to detect stratum-sensi-
tive genetic main effects (Behrens et al., 2011) but also allow for
testing geneistrata (GxS) interaction and joint (main + inter-
action) effects (Aschard et al., 2010; Magi et al., 2010; Randall
et al., 2013). Although a variety of methods for the analysis of
stratiﬁed GWAMA results exist, the availability of software
tools is limited (see Supplementary Table S1 for a comparison
with other GWAS tools).

We have developed an R-package called EasyStrata, which
allows the user to obtain statistical and graphical summaries
for comparisons across strata and to investigate potential GxS
effects. The software was developed within the GxE working
groups of the GIANT (Genetic Investigation of
ANthropometric Traits) consortium, and the functionality of
the package is exempliﬁed on GWAMA results for anthropo-
metric traits, which are publically available at www.broadinsti-
tute.org/collaboration/ giant. EasyStrata is applicable to stratified
GWAMAs of continuous or dichotomous outcomes, and many
of the functions are also applicable for ‘non-stratified’
GWAMAs (Supplementary Note).

2 IMPLEMENTATION

2.1 Features and functionality

The basis for the EasyStrata analyses are GWAMA results for
each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genome-wide and
by stratum (m strata) (Supplementary Fig. S1): the stratum-
speciﬁc meta-analyzed beta estimates and standard errors
[inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis (Cox and Hinkley,
1979)] or Z—scores and sample sizes [sample sizeiweighted
Z—scoreibased meta-analysis (Stouffer, 1949)] as well as other
information (e.g. stratum-speciﬁc association P-Values).
Examples for strata are men and women (m = 2), or older age
group and younger (m = 2), a combination of these (m = 4),
smoking status (non-smoker, previous smokers, current smokers,
m = 3) or other categorical exposures.

2.1.] Statistical functionality To evaluate stratiﬁed GWAMA
results, we have implemented statistical approaches to estimate
(i) the overall (i.e. strata-combined) effect by meta-analysis of the
m strata results (Cox and Hinkley, 1979; Stouffer, 1949); (ii) the
joint effect calculated from m strata results (Aschard et al., 2010);
(iii) the difference between two strata results as a means to test
for GxS effects (Randall et al., 2013); and (iv) the heterogeneity
between m strata (Cochran, 1954) (see Supplementary Table S2
for a summary of implemented statistics). All tests are applicable
for stratum-speciﬁc beta estimates and standard errors as well as
for stratum-speciﬁc Z—scores and sample sizes. We also provide
functions to correct the computed P—Values for multiple testing
by false discovery rate (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) or
Bonferroni correction (Johnson et al., 2010) and functions to
clump results into independentiin terms of physical distance
or linkage disequilibrium (LDFsubsets of significant SNPs.

2.1.2 Graphing functionality To Visualize stratiﬁed GWAMA
results, we have implemented state-of—the-art graphical func-
tions, such as QuantileiQuantile plot (QQ), scatterplot and
Manhattan plot. More speciﬁcally, we provide graphical features
that are tailored for between-strata comparison: EasyStrata
allows for contrasting two Manhattan plots in so-called
‘Miami’ plots (Fig. 1), for displaying multiple QQ curves in a
single graph (Supplementary Fig. S2), and for extending scatter-
plots by further dimensions (Supplementary Fig. S3). The graph-
ical functionality is complemented by other convenient features,
such as highlighting specific regions in Manhattan or Miami
plots (Fig. 1), excluding speciﬁc regions from QQ plots to
focus on the potential of novel associations, omitting less signiﬁ-
cant SNPs to substantially improve plotting speed for large
datasets, breaking up the scale of the y-axis to ensure proper
presentation of extremely signiﬁcant SNPs, or creating panels
of plots to provide a quick overview on the singular studies of
the GWAMA or on various traits (Supplementary Figs S4eS7).

2.2 Usage

Our open-source software is written in R and makes use of the
‘Cairo’ and the ‘plotrix’ packages. Extracting independent loci
using LD-based thresholds requires the software PLINK (Purcell
et al., 2007). For stratiﬁed GWAMA results based on

HapMap-imputed studies, we recommend to have at least
4GB of random access memory (RAM) available (see
Supplementary Table S3 for an evaluation of runtime and
RAM allocation). EasyStrata is started by calling the function
‘EasyStrata’ with an ecf—ﬁle as parameter: EasyStrata(‘/path2ecf/
example.ecf). The user-deﬁned ecf—ﬁle is a text-ﬁle that provides
a ﬂexible scripting interface that allows for generating custo-
mized analysis pipelines (Supplementary Fig. S8). A number of
template ecf—pipelines (e. g. those that were used to create the here
presented figures) can be downloaded from our Web site.

3 CONCLUSIONS

With EasyStrata, we provide a user-friendly R package that fa-
cilitates evaluation or graphical presentation of stratiﬁed
GWAMA results. We have developed this software as analysts
the GIANT consortium that meta-analyzed more than a hun-
dred studies to investigate the genetic underpinning of anthropo-
metric traits and to identify potential GxE effects. For example,
the functionality of our software has been used to evaluate sex-
stratified GWAMAs for multiple anthropometric traits (Randall
et al., 2013). The automated pipeline approach of EasyStrata can
save time and minimize errors from manually extracting and
merging the data. This software is highly useful for analysts to
cope with the increased complexity of high-dimensional stratified
GWAMAs data.

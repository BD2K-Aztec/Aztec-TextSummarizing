Abstract

Motivation: With improvements in next—generation sequencing technologies and reductions in
price, ordered RNA—seq experiments are becoming common. Of primary interest in these experi—
ments is identifying genes that are changing over time or space, for example, and then characteriz—
ing the specific expression changes. A number of robust statistical methods are available to
identify genes showing differential expression among multiple conditions, but most assume condi—
tions are exchangeable and thereby sacrifice power and precision when applied to ordered data.
Results: We propose an empirical Bayes mixture modeling approach called EBSeq—HMM. In
EBSeq—HMM, an auto—regressive hidden Markov model is implemented to accommodate depend—
ence in gene expression across ordered conditions. As demonstrated in simulation and case
studies, the output proves useful in identifying differentially expressed genes and in specifying
gene—specific expression paths. EBSeq—HMM may also be used for inference regarding isoform
expression.

Availability and implementation: An R package containing examples and sample datasets is avail—
able at Bioconductor.

1 Introduction

 

With improvements in next—generation sequencing technologies and
reductions in price, ordered RNA—seq experiments are becoming
common. Of primary interest in these experiments is characterizing
how genes are changing over some factor with ordered levels (for
example, ordered in time, in space, along a gradient, etc).

For simplicity, we refer to any ordered RNA—seq experiment as a
time—course experiment, noting that other similar designs may be
analyzed within this framework; and we restrict attention to time—
course data collected within a single biological condition.

In a time—course RNA—seq experiment, an investigator may be
interested in genes that are monotonically increasing or decreasing,

EBSeq—HMM: Identify expression changes in ordered RNA—seq experiments 2615

 

that increase initially then decrease, that increase initially then re—
main unchanged and so on. We refer to these types of changes in ex—
pression hereinafter as expression pat/75, and we consider three
broad types: (i) constant paths: expression remains unchanged, or
equally expressed (EE), over all time points; (ii) sporadic paths: ex—
pression shows some change between at least one pair of time
points, but remains unchanged between at least one other pair and
(iii) dynamic paths: expression changes continuously. With respect
to the examples listed earlier, the first few (expression is monotonic—
ally increasing, monotonically decreasing, increasing then decreas—
ing) are instances of dynamic paths. The last (increase initially then
remain unchanged) is an example of a sporadic path.

A number of robust statistical methods are available for identify—
ing differentially expressed (DE) genes [EBSeq (Leng et (11., 2013),
DESeq2 (Love et (11., 2014), edgeR (Robinson et (11., 2010), voom
(Law et (11., 2014), baySeq (Hardcastle and Kelly, 2010), Cuffdiff2
(Trapnell et (11., 2012)] as well as isoforms [EBSeq, rSquiff (Shi and
Jiang, 2013), Cuffdiff2, BitSeq (Glaus et (11., 2012)] in a static RNA—
seq experiment; and most of these methods accommodate time—
course experiments by considering time as a factor with multiple,
unordered, levels (Supplementary Section S7 provides details). The
statistical tests employed are designed to identify a gene as DE if it
shows a change at least one time point; and, consequently, non—con—
stant genes are detected collectively. Multiple steps of subsequent
analyses are required if an investigator wants to distinguish sporadic
paths from dynamic ones, to classify genes into distinct paths and to
assess the associated classification uncertainty—for example, per—
form model fitting multiple times with different design matrices and
then adjust for multiple testing. In addition, as these approaches
were not designed specifically for time—course experiments, they do
not accommodate dependence over time and consequently sacrifice
power if applied in this setting.

These same issues were addressed in the context of microarray
time—course experiments, and a number of methods are available for
analyzing (Conesa et (11., 2006; Filkov et (11., 2002; Ma et (11., 2009;
Yuan and Kendziorski, 2006) and clustering (Ernst et (11., 2005;
Luan and Li, 2003) time—course microarray data. These methods are
not directly applicable to RNA—seq studies since they do not accom—
modate count data, the unequal variabilities in measurements or the
dependence of isoforms within genes. To address this, the approach
developed by Conesa et al. (2006), maSigPro, originally developed
for microarray time—course analysis, was recently extended to ac—
commodate ordered RNA—seq count data (Nueda et (11., 2014). Like
DESeq2 and edgeR, maSigPro—GLM is based on a negative binomial
(NB) generalized linear model (GLM); but unlike previous
approaches, maSigPro—GLM defines gene—specific expected expres—
sion by a time—dependent polynomial to accommodate dependence
over time. Once significant genes are selected, a second regression is
conducted for each gene to identify the time points at which it shows
expression differences. Clustering algorithms are then applied to the
resulting regression coefficients and/0r expression values to identify
groups of genes with similar expression profiles. Although useful the
two step procedure makes it challenging to determine appropriate
thresholds for false discovery rate (FDR) control, and suggested
thresholds are conservative in many settings (Nueda et (11., 2014). In
addition, identified gene groups are subject to limitations inherent in
clustering algorithms; namely, the number of groups as well as
group membership are determined by user—defined cutoffs, there is
no probabilistic information associated with a given gene’s member—
ship within a group, and it is not clear how to classify gene groups
into expression paths.

To address these considerations, we have developed an empirical
Bayes auto—regressive hidden Markov model (HMM) based ap—
proach called EBSeq—HMM. The model extends our previous work,
EBSeq, for identifying DE genes and isoforms across two or more
biological conditions (Leng et (11., 2013). As detailed in Methods, an
auto—regressive process describes changes in expression over time,
and a hidden Markov component is used to accommodate depend—
ence. EBSeq—HMM allows users to identify genes with non—constant
expression over multiple ordered conditions, and simultaneously
classify them into expression paths. Results from a simulation study,
detailed in Section 3.1, suggest that EBSeq—HMM has increased
power over competing approaches for identifying genes following
non—constant paths, especially for those genes showing subtle yet
consistent changes over time. EBSeq—HMM also provides improved
accuracy in classifying genes into expression paths. Similar results
are demonstrated in a case study of the adult mouse limb presented
in Section 3.2.

2 Methods

2.1 EBSeq—HMM: an empirical Bayes auto—regressive
Hidden Markov model

EBSeq—HMM requires estimates of gene or isoform expression col—
lected over three or more ordered levels of a factor. The general
model is presented for gene—level analysis; the isoform—level model is
discussed in Section 2.3. To simplify the presentation, we refer to
ordered levels as time points denoted by t : 1, 2, . . . , T, noting that
the method directly accommodates other ordered data structures
(e.g. ordered in space, along a gradient, etc.).

Let X, be a G X N, matrix of expression values for G genes in N,
samples at time t. The full set of observed expression values is then
denoted by X : (X1,X2, . . . ,XT). With a slight abuse of notation,
let Xg denote one row of this matrix containing data for gene g over
time; Xgm denotes expression values for gene g at time t in sample 71.
Of interest are changes in the latent mean expression levels for gene
gz MglnugZ: "'
scribe such changes: Up, Down, EE. If ut_1 < m, we define state S“

,pgT. We allow for three possibilities, or states, to de—

as Up; if ut_1 > m, S“ is Down and ut_1 : )1, defines S“ as EE. The
main goals in an ordered RNA—seq experiment—identifying genes
that change over time, and specifying each genes’ expression path—
can be restated as questions about these underlying states. In short,
for each gene g and each transition between t—1 and t, we would
like to estimate the probability of each state. A gene is said to follow
a non—constant path if at least one state is not EE. We would also
like to estimate the most likely expression path, which is given by
the configuration of expression states over time (S432, 5433, . . . ,SgT),
noting that the most likely configuration of states need not equal the
collection of states that define Sgt marginally at each t (an example
is provided in Section 3.1).

To make inference regarding these states, we propose a
model for the set of expression measurements taken on a gene g.
We make the common and well—supported assumption that gene
expression in an RNA—seq experiment is well described by a NB dis—
tribution (Anders and Huber, 2010; Hardcastle and Kelly, 2010;
Love et (11., 2014; Nueda et (11., 2014; Robinson et (11., 2010;
Trapnell et (11., 2012). Were we to consider time t in isolation,
this implies Xgmlrgt, qgt ~ NB (@481) where the NB distribu—
tion may be parameterized such that pg, : rgt(1 — qgt)/qg,. For sim—
plicity of notation, we assume equal library sizes. Details on
adjustments for unequal library sizes are given in Supplementary
Section S2.

Because our interest here is in quantifying changes in Xg, over
time, we assume expression at time t depends on that at t—1 through
parameters r and q. Specifically, (Xgmlrg, t_1, qg,t_1, Sgt : 5) ~
NB(rg7,_1€;, qg,,_1) where 5; : c ifs is Up; 5; : 1/c ifs is Down
and 5; : 1 if s is EE. The data dependent parameter c specifies the
expected change associated with each state. For example, if (2:2,
then 5? :Up refers to a 2—fold increase in expression between t—1
and t. Although c may be defined by a user, we suggest estimation
by maximum likelihood (see the next section). We further model
ﬂuctuations in Mg, by defining a prior distribution for qg, : (qgtloi, I},
Xg,t_1 : xg,t_1) ~ Beta(ot + Nt_1rg,t_1, l)’ + Zixgqt_1qi) for all g
and t > 1. Given this set—up, when t > 1, the marginal predictive con—
ditional distribution describing expression (or emissions) for each
state is Beta—NB: (Xgle ,t_1 : xg,t_1,S§t,®) ~ Beta2NB(oi + N,_1
rg,t_1,/)’+ ZixgﬁpLhégrgﬁpﬂ where O : [ot,/)’,rg,t_1,€;]. The ex—
pected mean is then defined as égrgﬁpﬁl)’ + Zixgﬁt_1ﬁ,-)/(oi + N,_1
rg,t_1) (Teerapabolarn, 2008). When t: 1, the prior distribution for
qg1 is defined as (qg1lu,/)’) ~ Beta(ot,/)’) for all g, and the marginal
predictive distribution is (Xg1nl®) ~ Beta2NB (06, l)’, rgﬁ1).

For genes with dynamic paths, each state S? is dependent on the
prior state Sgt—1 since these genes represent continuous changes over
time. To accommodate this dependence, we assume that the state
process is described by a Markov chain. The constant and sporadic
genes do not show continuous changes over time, and consequently
we assume that states are independent, although we note that de—
pendence among expression levels is still accommodated via the
auto—regressive component.

In summary, the time—course Xg for a dynamic gene is governed
by two interrelated probabilistic mechanisms: the conditional distri—
bution (emissions model) at each time and the process describing the
evolution of states over time. Initially, we assume that the observed
expression vector can be characterized by the Beta—NB model
described earlier and that the state process can be described by a
Markov chain. Were it the case that dependence among measure—
ments is fully captured by the state process, the proposed model
would be a standard HMM. However, this last assumption does not
hold, given that X, for dynamic genes depends not only on the state
S“ but also on Xt_1 through rt_1. Consequently, the model for dy—
namic genes is given by a Markov—switching auto—regressive model,
as in Hamilton (1989) and Ailliot and Monbet (2012) (Fig. 1). For
constant and sporadic genes, we assume the same emissions model,
but do not assume the state process is Markov. Taken together, since
we do not know the expression path type a priori, the model for the
full set of expression measurements is a two—component mixture
over the sporadic/constant and dynamic genes.

2.2 Parameter estimation

In the emissions distributions, the unknown parameters (r’s, 06 and
[3) are estimated using the method of moments (r’s are estimated
within time point while 06 and l)’ are estimated using all samples); 6 is
estimated via maximum likelihood. Recall that EBSeq—HMM as—
sumes a mixture model with a Markov component m1 and a non—
Markov component m2. We assume equal prior probabilities of
being in each mixture component.

In Markov chain m1, the Baum—Welch algorithm is used to esti—
mate initial nl- : P(S§2 : jlm1) and state transition probabilities
£13,?“ : HS?“ :le? : d,m1) for t22. Here, we assume a non—
homogeneous Markov chain for the hidden states so aZ’Hhs are dif—
ferent for different t’s. Denote the vector of initial probabilities arid

the state transition matrices estimated from the last step as 17,

the parameter set with maximum likelihood is used in the final
model.

2.3 Inference at the isoform level

The model detailed in the previous section applies to gene counts.
To apply the approach to isoforms, the uncertainty inherent in
isoform expression estimation should be accommodated. In short,

EBSeq—HMM: Identify expression changes in ordered RNA—seq experiments 2617

 

estimating expression at the gene—level is a relatively easy task in
RNA—seq as all reads mapping to a gene’s constituent exons may be
used. The same holds true for estimating expression for an isoform
unique to its parent gene. However, for genes with multiple iso—
forms, the problem is more challenging as reads mapping to overlap—
ping exons (exons present in more than one isoform) must be
allocated to isoforms in a way that is consistent with their expres—
sion. Consequently, there is increased uncertainty (on average) in ex—
pression estimates for isoforms with multiple overlapping exons,
referred to as complex isoforms; and the uncertainty has been shown
to have a substantial effect on downstream analysis methods (Leng
et (11., 2013).

Specifically, define an isoform of gene g as belonging to the
I g : [2 group, for example, where k : 1, 2 or 3, if the total number of
isoforms from gene g is k (the Ig:3 group contains all isoforms
from genes having 3 or more isoforms). Leng et al. (2013) demon—
strated that there is decreased variability in the 1g: 1 group, but
increased variability in the others, due to the relative increase in un—
certainty inherent in estimating isoform expression when multiple
isoforms of a given gene are present. This observation is not specific
to the dataset and/or the method used for isoform expression estima—
tion; it is also not specific to the particular method used for quan—
tifying isoform complexity.

To adjust for the increased uncertainty inherent in complex iso—
form expression estimates, we allow the Beta prior to depend on iso—
form group: qg lot, [313 ~ Beta(ot, [313 The hyperparameter 06 is shared
across isoforms, but here [3 depends on 1g, accommodating the sys—
tematic differences in variability among the 1g groups. 1g quantifies a
measure of isoform complexity and may be defined by the user as
the number of isoforms from a gene, as described earlier. It could
also be defined by an isoform’s mappability score or credibility
interval as provided by Koehler et al. (2011), Li and Dewey (2011)
or Derrien et a1. (2012).

2.4 Simulated data

We followed the simulation setup of Robinson and Smyth (2007) by
defining counts as NB with gene—specific mean in sample n and time
point t given by Mg, and variance ugt(1 + ugt¢>gt). The (ugh ¢>gt)’s
were sampled as pairs from the mouse limb case study data
described in the next section. Paired sampling was done to preserve
the mean—variance relationship observed in most RNA—seq datasets.
Each simulated dataset contains 10 000 genes and 15 samples which
represent three biological replicates at each of five time points. One
hundred datasets were considered for each simulation scenario.

2.4.1 Sim I

Sim I considers dynamic changes over time for 60% of the genes,
which matches the percentage in the case study data. For these
genes, paths were generated from an HMM. With five conditions,
there are four states in the hidden chain (as shown in Fig. 1), so
three state transition matrices were used. We defined the initial
probabilities as 0.5 and the state transition matrices as

0.9 0.1 0.1 0.9 0.9 0.1
, and , which resulted in
0.2 0.8 0.8 0.2 0.1 0.9

Up—Up—Down—Down and Down—Down—Up—Up being the two most
frequent expression paths. Note that other paths were realized as
well, although with fewer genes. Once a gene’s particular path
(collection of states) was generated, pg,“ was simulated as pg,
multiplied (divided) by 5 if S?“ was Up (Down). For one—half of

the dynamic genes, we simulated strong effects, with 5 sampled

from empirical FCs between 1.3 and 1.4 calculated using case
study data. The other one—half represent weak effects with 5
sampled from empirical FCs between 1.2 and 1.3. The remaining
40% of genes were simulated as constant meaning the latent level
of expression remains unchanged across conditions. To simulate
genes following constant paths, we only took the genes whose
simulated empirical FC of medians between any two adjacent time
points was within (1/1.2, 1.2).

2.4.2 Sim I]

For this simulation scenario, 40% of the 10000 genes were simu—
lated as dynamic as in Sim I and another 20% were simulated as
sporadic. For dynamic genes, paths were generated from an HMM
as described in Sim I; half were simulated as strong effects and the
other half were with weak effects. For the sporadic genes, a time
point t was chosen at random and Mg, was defined as pg, >I< 5, where 5
was sampled from empirical FCs between 1.3 and 1.4. The remain—
ing 40% of genes were simulated as constant, again as described in
Sim I.

2.5 Case study data

Of interest in our case study, detailed below, is RNA—seq data from
the James Thomson Lab at the Morgridge Institute for Research.
We evaluated gene expression from seven positions along the mouse
limb: proximal stylopod, distal stylopod, elbow, proximal zeugo—
pod, distal zeugopod, autopod and digit. Three 12—week old C57BL/
6] female mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation, followed by
the extraction of the right forelimb. The tissues were treated with
RNAlater (Sigma), per manufacturers instructions, dissected using a
SteREO Discovery.V8 microscope (Zeiss), and stored at —20°C.
The tissues were homogenized and lysed using a variable speed rotor
stator homogenizer and Qiazol (Qiagen). Total RNA was extracted
from the homogenized tissue samples using Qiagen’s RNeasy Lipid
Tissue Mini (digits) and Midi (all other) Kits. A total of 21 samples
were sequenced using Illumina’s Directional mRNA—Seq protocol
(Part # 15018460 Rev. A). The reads are single—end with read length
42—bp. Each sample was run on one lane of an Illumina GAII in a
randomized order to reduce batch effects. Alignment was done using
Bowtie (Langmead et (11., 2010) with the hg19 RefSeq annotation.
Expression estimates were obtained from RSEM (Li and Dewey,
2011) and library size factors were obtained using median—of—ratios
normalization (Anders and Huber, 2010). See Supplementary
Section S7 for package versions and further details.

2.6 Identification of DE genes and classification
EBSeq—HMM is compared with EBSeq, DESeq2, edgeR, voom,
maSigPro and a naive method based on FC. See Supplementary
Section S7 for package versions and further details. Two tasks are of
interest: identifying DE genes, defined as those showing any change
across conditions; and assigning DE genes into their most likely ex—
pression path.

2.6.1 Identification of DE genes

To identify a list of DE genes with FDR or via EBSeq—HMM 0r
EBSeq, we take those genes for which the posterior probability (PP)
of being constant is less than or equal to 06.

Both DESeq2 and edgeR implement a generalized—linear model
to test H0: data ~ intercept versus H 1: data ~ intercept + condition
with derived P—values adjusted for multiplicities using Benjamini
and Hochberg (1995). To construct a list of DE genes with target
FDR 06, we consider those genes with adjusted P—values less than or

112 /310'S[BHJnOprOJXO'SOIJ’BLUJOJIIIOICI”Idllq 11101} pap1201umoq

equal to 06. As detailed in Law et al. (2014), the voom approach first
estimates the precision weights based on the inverse variance, then
applies the limma empirical Bayes pipeline taking the precision
weights as prior information to account for the unequal variabilities
in RNA—seq data. A similar hypothesis test was performed as in
DESeq2 and edgeR, and the P—values were adjusted using
Benjamini—Hochberg as well. Genes with adjusted P—values less than
or equal to 06 were considered.

As suggested in the maSigPro user manual, we applied the GLM
method in the maSigPro package with the NB family and default
parameter settings. We also considered two additional settings.
Specifically, maSigPro uses an R2 value to obtain a sorted gene list.
However, it is not clear how to pick an R2 threshold that gives a
gene list with FDR controlled at some target level. The authors sug—
gest 0.7 as the default R2 value. In addition to this default setting,
we also considered R2 thresholds of 0.5 and 0.3 to evaluate
maSigPro more thoroughly.

For the naive FC method, denote med:g as the median expression
of gene g at time point t. A gene g is called Up (Down) between t

. dl+1 . . . .
and t + 1 1f %— 15 greater than (less than) K; otherw15e, 1t 15 EE. We
3

evaluate five values of K: 1.2, 1.3, 1.5, 2 and 2.5. A gene is defined
as DE if it is non—EE at any transition.

2.6.2 Classification of genes into expression paths

Recall that EBSeq—HMM provides gene—specific posterior probabil—
ities associated with each expression path. For EBSeq—HMM, a DE
gene is classified into a specific expression path if its PP of being in
that path exceeds 0.5. Selecting genes with PP > 0.5 ensures that the
posterior maximizing class always minimizes the Bayes risk regard—
less of choice of the metric loss function (Schluter et (11., 2005), al—
though we note that there may be reasons to consider different
thresholds in some situations (Section 4). For EBSeq, DESeq2,
edgeR, voom and maSigPro, classifying DE genes into expression
paths is not of interest, and no clear guidelines on how to do so is
provided. Consequently, these methods are not evaluated for expres—
sion path classification. Finally, since no uncertainty measure of as—
signment is available using FC, for the FC analysis a gene is classified
into the path defined by the Up/Down/EE calls across transitions.

3 Results

3.1 Simulation results

Simulation studies were conducted to investigate the operating char—
acteristics of EBSeq—HMM and to assess how it compares with
EBSeq, DESeq2, edgeR, voom, maSigPro and FC analysis. As de—
tailed in Methods, each simulated dataset derives counts from a NB
model. Like EBSeq—HMM, EBSeq, DESeq2, edgeR and maSigPro
also assume that counts are distributed as NB, and consequently,
this assumption should not provide advantage, or lack thereof, to
any one method in particular. As the form of the variance is that
assumed in edgeR, there may be a slight advantage given to that
method. Parameter estimates were derived from case study data to
help ensure that many features of real data are preserved in the
simulation (e.g. mean/variance relationship and magnitude of FCs;
Section 2.4 and the Supplement Section S3 for more details).

Table 1 shows the power and FDR for identifying dynamic genes
in Sim I, where the target FDR is controlled at 5%. In addition to
showing power overall, it is also shown separately for strong and
weak effects (FDR is not shown for each subgroup because false dis—
coveries are discoveries of EE genes and therefore cannot be

classified as strong or weak). EBSeq—HMM has higher power than
EBSeq, DESeq2, edgeR and voom, which is largely due to its ability
to identify genes showing subtle, yet consistent, changes over time.
Specifically, the power of the five methods is comparable for genes
with strong effects, but EBSeq—HMM shows advantage in identify—
ing genes where changes between any two points are relatively
small. An example of two genes identified exclusively by EBSeq—
HMM is shown in Figure 2 [panels (a) and (b)]. It is clear from the
figure that the change between any two points is small (FC < 1.3)
and in some cases these changes would not be identified by a mar—
ginal analysis between adjacent time points [e.g. time points 1 and 2
in Fig. 2b], but EBSeq—HMM identifies the genes as dynamic given
the consistent changes over time.

Note that although EBSeq—HMM has the highest empirical FDR
among these five methods, it is still well—controlled under the 5%
target FDR. In fact, among all approaches, the empirical FDR from
EBSeq—HMM is closest to the target FDR. To better understand the
overall performance of each method, the third column in Table 1
shows the F1 score. The F1 score measures a test’s accuracy account—
ing for both power and false discoveries, where an F1 score reaches
its best value at 1 and worst at 0. EBSeq—HMM has the highest F1
score among all approaches.

In addition, Table 1 shows that [consistent with other studies
(Nueda et (11., 2014)], the suggested threshold of maSigPro
(R2 : 0.7) is conservative and provides lower power than EBSeq—
HMM, EBSeq, DESeq2, edgeR and voom. The power is improved
by relaxing the threshold, but is still lower than others. The FC ana—
lysis works best at threshold 1.3, but is still inferior to the other
methods.

Table 2 shows the power, FDR and F1 score for identifying DE
genes (either dynamic or sporadic) in Sim II where, again, the target
FDR is controlled at 5%. The increased power of EBSeq—HMM in
identifying dynamic genes that was demonstrated in Sim I persists
when sporadic genes are present, and EBSeq—HMM also shows ad—
vantage for identifying sporadic genes.

In spite of this advantage, we note that all methods show
reduced power for identifying sporadic genes. This is because in the
simulation (and in our case study data upon which the simulation is
based), the range of expression differences in sporadic genes is
smaller, in general, than in dynamic genes. For example, consider
dynamic genes having fold changes at each transition between 1.3
and 1.4. On average, for a dynamic gene that is monotonically
increasing, the range in expression would be ~ 1354 : 332 over all
conditions (for a weak dynamic gene, the range would be ~ 2.44).
However, in a sporadic gene, the range would be ~ 1.35 since only
one condition differs from the others.

In addition to identification of DE genes, we also evaluated the
ability of EBSeq—HMM and FC to classify genes into distinct expres—
sion paths (EBSeq, DESeq2, edgeR, voom and maSigPro were not
evaluated as they were not developed for this purpose; Section 2.6).
Figure 3 shows results for eight dynamic paths simulated in Sim I;
these eight were chosen as they contain the most genes among all
simulated paths. The ground truth shows the number of genes simu—
lated in each expression path. Also shown are the average number
classified into each path by EBSeq—HMM and by FC analysis at FC
threshold K: 1.2 and 1.3 (averages are calculated over 100 Sim I
datasets). Correct classifications are shown in blue; incorrect are
shown in red. For FC analysis, we chose 1.2 and 1.3 as they per—
formed best under all thresholds considered. As shown, EBSeq—
HMM identified more true positives than FC, while the FDR is well
below 5 %. Similar results were observed in Sim II data
(Supplementary Fig. S2).

3.2 Case study results

An important problem in regenerative biology is understanding the
connection between gene expression patterns and the positional
identities of cells throughout development. Once humans and other
mammals reach adulthood, they possess a very limited ability to re—
generate body parts like limb structures; and it has been hypothe—
sized that a loss of positional identity information is at least
partially responsible for the reduction in regenerative capacity.
However, a few studies (Chang, 2009; Rinn et (11., 2006; Wang
et (11., 2009) have demonstrated that some aspects of positional iden—
tity in mammals are retained into adulthood. Understanding the
changes in gene expression across limb positions in mammals is an
essential first step in gaining a better understanding of these proc—
esses. Toward this end, we conducted RNA—seq experiments to

study gene expression changes over seven positions (proximal to dis—
tal) along the limbs of adult mice.

EBSeq—HMM, EBSeq, DESeq2, edgeR and voom identified
14817, 12 825, 11 517, 9520 and 10259 DE genes at a 5% target
FDR, and there is substantial overlap among the lists. Specifically,
EBSeq—HMM identified over 90% of the genes identified by the
other approaches. maSigPro identified 2479, 6919 and 10727 DE
genes using R2 threshold 0.7, 0.5 and 0.3 and FC analyses identified
4225, 6500, 10881, 14016 and 15 877 genes for K 22.5, 2, 1.5,
1.3 and 1.2, respectively. These identifications showed substantially
lower overlap with other methods.

Given that the majority of genes identified by EBSeq, DESeq2,
edgeR and voom are also identified by EBSeq—HMM, we focus ini—
tially on genes that are identified exclusively by EBSeq—HMM.
Figure 2c and d shows two examples. As in the simulated data
[shown in (a) and (b)], these genes have subtle but consistent
changes over the seven limb positions, again demonstrating that by
accommodating dependence, EBSeq—HMM has increased power to
identify genes showing relatively weak, but consistent, changes.
Supplementary Figure S3 shows similar results for other genes iden—
tified exclusively by EBSeq—HMM.

Although the simulation and case study results suggest that
EBSeq—HMM has increased power for identifying DE genes, the
main advantage of EBSeq—HMM over other approaches is in its abil—
ity to classify genes into particular expression paths. To illustrate,
we consider Hox genes, a set of genes that are of primary interest
here as they are well—known to play an important role in maintain—
ing positional identity in adult cells (Rinn et (11., 2006; Wang et (11.,
2009). In our case study data, 33 out of 39 Hex genes were identi—
fied as DE by EBSeq—HMM. Figure 4 shows expression levels of the
33 genes along with their most likely expression paths. Although the
positional changes for most Hox genes are not well—known, it is
known that Hoxb4 and Hoxb8 have up—regulated expression in
proximal sites (Rinn et (11., 2006; Wang et (11., 2009). The EBSeq—
HMM paths for these genes are consistent with these prior studies
and provide further information as they characterize changes across
the seven positions. In addition, the overall pattern of Hox gene ex—
pression found here demonstrates that, in general, higher numbered
Hox genes are up—regulated distally and lower numbered Hox genes
are up—regulated proximally. This is in agreement with existing data
and models of proximal—distal patterning of the limb (Zakany and
Duboule, 2007).

Number of genes

Fig. 3. Shown are the number of genes (ground truth) simulated in Sim l as
being in each of eight dynamic paths (these eight are shown as they contain
the most genes among all simulated paths). Also shown are the average
number classified into each path by EBSeq-HMM and by FC analysis at
thresholds 1.2 and 1.3 (averages are calculated over 100 Sim | datasets).
Correct classifications are shown in blue (first bar); incorrect are shown in red
(second bar)

To explore other genes beyond the Hex family that may be
involved in positional identity, we considered 2347 genes that are clas—
sified by EBSeq—HMM into one of 64 possible dynamic paths. Among
the 64 clusters formed by these dynamic genes, the two largest are Up—
Down—Up—Down—Down—Down (827) and Down—Up—Down—Up—Up—
Up (218). Figure 5a and b shows median expression of each position
for each of these genes. As these groups each contain Hox genes but
also previously unknown genes showing similar dynamics across pos—
ition, the novel identifications define candidates for further study.

4 Discussion

We have developed an approach called EBSeq—HMM for analysis of
ordered RNA—seq experiments. EBSeq—HMM may be used to iden—
tify genes that are DE across a set of ordered conditions and to clas—
sify genes into their most likely expression paths. There are a
number of methods available for identifying DE genes that may be
used when data from multiple conditions is available. EBSeq—HMM
has two main advantages over these approaches. First, it accommo—
dates dependence across ordered conditions and consequently has

increased power to identify genes showing subtle, yet consistent,
changes. Second, for every gene, EBSeq—HMM calculates the gene—
specific PP associated with each possible expression path and in
doing so allows for genes to be classified into distinct expression
paths with a pre—specified FDR. Put another way, EBSeq—HMM not
only identifies genes that change across conditions, but can be used
to specify how they change.

Simulations demonstrated the power of EBSeq—HMM over other
approaches to identify DE genes. In particular, results showed that
DESeq2, edgeR and voom perform well in detecting trends and/or
changes are relatively strong, but that EBSeq—HMM has increased
power to identify genes showing weaker changes. EBSeq—HMM also
worked well for identifying genes showing sporadic changes (where
there is no dependence across ordered conditions as for some genes
in Sim II). Applying maSigPro—GLM with its default cutoff for call—
ing DE genes gave significantly reduced power than other
approaches. Relaxing the cutoff improved its power, but it was still
inferior to the others.

In addition to DE gene identification, EBSeq—HMM performed
well for classifying genes into expression paths. We defined a gene as
being in a particular path if the gene was classified as DE at FDR 5%
(PP of EE was less than 0.05) and the PP of being in that path ex—
ceeded 0.5. Given the two step process, observed mis—classification
rates were conservatively controlled. Note that in some cases, a DE
gene may not be classified to any particular path. For example, if the
last time point of a four—condition experiment is known to be noisy, a
gene that is initially increasing may have equal PP, say one—third, of
being Up—Up—Up, Up—Up—EE, and Up—Up—Down. This gene would be
called DE with 5% FDR since PP(EE—EE—EE) < 0.05, but it would not
be assigned into a particular expression path if threshold 0.5 was
used. In some cases, a user may want to modify these thresholds. If a
false negative classification was considered more serious than a false
positive, this threshold could be adjusted. Motivation for doing so
under varying loss functions is discussed in (Berger, 1985).

5 Implementation

EBSeq—HMM is implemented as an R package (EBSeqHMM), cur—
rently available at Bioconductor: www.bioconductor.org/packages/
devel/bioc/html/EBSeqHMM.html. EBSeq—HMM requires estimates
of gene or isoform expression, but is not specific to any particular esti—
mation method. To estimate library sizes, EBSeq—HMM defaults to

Like most methods, EBSeq—HMM makes assumptions regarding
the distribution governing expression measurements. Consequently,
poor performance may result if there are strong departures from
these assumptions. Model diagnostics are implemented in EBSeq—
HMM to ensure that assumptions can be easily checked. They
should be considered with each application and results should not
be used if serious departures from model assumptions are observed.
A typical diagnostic summary for the case study data is shown in
Supplementary Figure S4.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The interaction between drugs and their targets, often
proteins, and between antibodies and their targets, is important for
planning and analyzing investigational and therapeutic interventions in
many biological systems. Although drug-target and antibody-target
datasets are available in separate databases, they are not publicly
available in an integrated bioinformatics resource. As medical thera-
peutics, especially in cancer, increasingly uses targeted drugs and
measures their effects on biomolecular profiles, there is an unmet
need for a user-friendly toolset that allows researchers to comprehen-
sively and conveniently access and query information about drugs,
antibodies and their targets.

Summary: The PiHelper framework integrates human drug-target and
antibody-target associations from publicly available resources to help
meet the needs of researchers in systems pharmacology, perturbation
biology and proteomics. PiHelper has utilities to (i) import drug- and
antibody-target information; (ii) search the associations either pro-
grammatically or through a web user interface (Ul); (iii) visualize the
data interactively in a network; and (iv) export relationships for use in
publications or other analysis tools.

Availability: PiHelper is a free software under the GNU Lesser General
Public License (LGPL) v3.0. Source code and documentation are at
http://bit.ly/pihelper. We plan to coordinate contributions from the
community by managing future releases.

1 INTRODUCTION

In cancer biology, systems pharmacology and perturbation biol-
ogy, researchers designing targeted drug experiments often need
to choose targeted drugs and antibodies of interest for their ex-
perimental studies. For such studies, drug- and antibody-target
databases are valuable resources and are increasingly publicly
available in computable formats. Unfortunately, this informa-
tion is in separate databases that use mostly incompatible for-
mats, making it difficult to integrate data across different
resources. This, coupled with strict constraints on distribution
of the data, hinders access to up-to-date integrated data.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Here we describe an open-source framework, PiHelper, for
easy aggregation, integration and Visualization of drug- and anti-
body-target data from multiple sources. PiHelper provides a
platform-independent command-line tool to help users, with
minimal configuration, import and export drug- and antibody-
target information in a human- and gene-centric manner; a Java
application programming interface and a REST-ful (Representa-
tional State Transfer) web service to facilitate programmatic
access to the aggregated data; and a web-based UI to help
users query data in a gene-centric manner and export the results
as an image or undirected binary network.

We believe PiHelper will facilitate hypothesis generation and
design of new experiments by enabling researchers to access and
query integrated drug-target and antibody-target data from mul-
tiple resources in an automatic way.

2 COMPONENTS
2.1 Administration module

The administration module provides a command-line interface
for users to import data into a database or export the aggregated
data to tab-delimited format for further analysis. The importer
component supports automatic fetching of background gene
information, gene sets, gene-centric drug-target and antibody-
target annotations from multiple resources (Table l). Importing
data from these resources is accomplished in an automatic
manner through PiHelper’s admin command-line interface. The
admin module contains specific data converters for each resource
and frees the user from handling different file formats and mer-
ging data across resources. The user also has the option to import
drug- and antibody-target data from custom tab-delimited files.

Once the database is populated through the admin tool, the
exporter component can be used to export all drug and antibody
data to a tab-delimited text format (TSV). These ﬁles can then be
used for further analysis tools, e.g. by importing the data into
Cytoscape as a binary network and running graph-based queries
or Visualizing larger networks (Shannon et al., 2003).

2.2 Web-based U1

The web-based UI distributed as a part of PiHelper enables users
to query antibodies and drugs in a gene-centric manner (Povey
et al., 2001). It also helps Visualize the results as a binary network
and export the final network in either scalable vector graphics

Fig. 1. Sample target network visualization: results showing all drug and
antibody associations of EGFR and ERBBZ genes. PiHelper web UI
allows exporting the network to various formats, e.g. SVG and Simple
Interaction Formats

(SVG), portable network graphics, GraphML or simple inter-
action formats. The visualization of the query results as an inter-
active network is accomplished through the Cytoscape Web
library (Lopes et al., 2010). The web-based UI features automatic
validation of the gene names, pre-loaded gene sets representing
most of the well-known canonical pathways in the query page;
details for a gene, drug, antibody or the targeting interaction
upon clicking on the corresponding element within the network;
and options to expand the network based on either genes or
drugs in the network and to download the network for external
use (Fig. 1).

2.3 Core module

The core module provides the model Java classes and basic
ﬁnder methods. The model classes consist of basic elements,

such as Drug, Gene and DrugTarget, which capture drugi
and antibodyigene relationships. These elements, together with
their querying methods, help developers build custom applica-
tions or analysis tools that depend on drug or antibody annota-
tion data.

Besides the Java application programming interface, the core
module also includes a web service component that provides
basic querying methods through REST protocols. The web ser-
vice supports obtaining the results in either JavaScript Object
Notation or HyperText Markup Language. The former provides
ﬂexibility for developers who prefer other programming lan-
guages than Java; the latter enables users to interact with the
database via their web browser of choice.

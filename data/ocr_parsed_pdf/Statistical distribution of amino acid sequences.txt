ABSTRACT

Motivation: The article presents results of the listing of the
quantity of amino acids, dipeptides and tripeptides for all proteins
available in the UNIPROT—TREMBL database and the listing
for selected species and enzymes. UNIPROT—TREMBL contains
protein sequences associated with computationally generated
annotations and large-scale functional characterization. Due to
the distinct metabolic pathways of amino acid syntheses and
their physicochemical properties, the quantities of subpeptides
in proteins vary. We have proved that the distribution of amino
acids, dipeptides and tripeptides is statistical which confirms that
the evolutionary biodiversity development model is subject to the
theory of independent events. It seems interesting that certain short
peptide combinations occur relatively rarely or even not at all.
First, it confirms the Darwinian theory of evolution and second, it
opens up opportunities for designing pharmaceuticals among rarely
represented short peptide combinations. Furthermore, an innovative
approach to the mass analysis of bioinformatic data is presented.

1 INTRODUCTION

According to the evolution theory of life development on Earth
(Darwin, 1859; Kaplan et (11., 2000), the process of species’
assimilation to the environment has generated genetic changes
leading to optimum acclimatization. As a result, the 20 stande
amino acids encoded by nucleic acids, which form proteins found in
all species, occur in precisely deﬁned quantities in each protein. The
distribution of polypeptides is a good measure of the randomness of
changes in the environment (Lenski, 1998, Bennett et al., 1990) for
respective species and it also represents the statistical distribution
of selected polypeptides. Homology-based methods for designing
protein tertiary structures are a useful consequence of this.

2 METHODS

A script was developed which counts the number of polypeptides with
a deﬁned length. Due to software limitations. only the listing of all the
available di- (400) and tripeptides (8000) could be Visualized. The script
sorts polypeptides according to the number of polypeptide occurrences for the

deﬁned amino acid sequence or totally at random. The counting is performed
by single amino acids or by a deﬁned polypeptide length.

2.1 fastaUniqAASeq.pl (Fasta Unique Sequences
Amino Acids Search Script) description

FASTA is a linear format for the description of proteins and DNA/RNA. Files
in the FASTA format contain information about the types of amino acids in
a protein. The format is very useful for searching for similar proteins in
databases (BLAST. CLUSTALW projects). The largest FASTA databases
are AS follows: UNIPROT. Sprot (Wu et al.. 2006) and Protein Data Bank
(PDB). Owing to the software developed (fastaUniqAASeqpl). we can
search for recurring sequences of any length in FASTA ﬁles in two modes:

0 Normal search (precise search. searching sequences one by one
amino acid).

0 Offset search (search with jumps by a deﬁned sequence length).

The precise search involves the listing of all amino acid sequences with a
deﬁned length (shift by one amino acid). The offset search. in turn. involves
shifting by a deﬁned length (offset) with fragments at a distance of the offset
being included. This is best explained by an example in Table 1.

Furthermore. the script can ﬁlter results (w. withoutlgnored option) to
avoid situations when unknown amino acids (X) occur in the listing. One
of the options is to generate sequences which do not occur in a group of
sequences. This is useful for statistical analysis. The programme can sort
results of searching for unique amino acid sequences in various ways:

0 key-ascialphabetic sorting. ascending by the amino acid name.

0 key-randomino sorting.

The programme Visualizes results using three methods. The most
important is to count the physical number of sequences. In addition, it
provides normalized quantity and percentage of a sequence. The programme
has been used on the UNIPROTiTREMBL database. The sequences for
species and selected enzymes were obtained using fastaGrep.pl. FastaGrep.pl
is a programme used to retrieve respective protein or enzyme types or any
combinations of characters in the description of a sequence (following the ‘>’
character) from large FASTA ﬁles. When analyzing the whole UNIPROTi
TREMBL ﬁle, fastaSplit.pl (a programme which splits FASTA ﬁles while
retaining their structure, according to the number of entries in the resulting
FASTA ﬁle or size of the resulting ﬁle) was also used; the programme was
developed to enable the analysis of large protein sets using computers without
sufﬁcient memory by fastaUniqAASeq.pl. When processing ﬁles resulting
from the splitting of large FASTA ﬁles, fastaStatResultsMerge.pl is used to
merge the results.

The available UNIPROTiTREMBL database (Release 40.0 of 24 March
2009) was used for the global count analysis and a global histogram of amino
acid triplets was generated (Figs 13).

3 CALCULATION

The calculation was performed for the whole UNIPROT TREMBL
sequence database by counting amino acids, dipeptides and
tripeptides. Histograms for percentage values were generated and the
results of theoretical calculation were correlated with the counting
results. Subsequently, species (Arabidopsis thaliana, Danio rerio,

Escherichia coli, Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Oryza sativa,
Saccharomyces cerevisiae) were searched for. The selection of
species resulted from the quantity of available sequences and the
number of enzymes within the species. Hydrolases, polymerases
and transferases were listed for each of the test species. Enzymes
for which more than 100 protein sequences were available were
used for comparative analysis. The Table 2 shows the number of
sequences and enzymes for the species. Hydrolases from A.thaliana
and D. rerio were rejected due to small number of sequences.

4 RESULTS

According to the theory of independent events (Cramer, 1946), the
change of an observed quantity with respect to the reference quantity
is proportional to the observed quantity. The theory is reﬂected
for example in thermal conductivity, statistical thermodynamics,
chemical kinetics and the Lambert—Beer law. In mathematical terms,
this means logarithmic decay of the observed quantity, dx. In
our computational experiment, the distribution of dipeptides and
tripeptides represented in the TREMBL database is logarithmic
with the regression coefﬁcient R2 higher than 0.9. The percentage
correlation between the theoretical number of di- (Fig. 2) and
tripeptides (Fig. 3) and values calculated using the programme
shows a linear relation with the regression coefﬁcient R2 higher than
0.9. The theoretical number of di- and tripeptides was calculated
from the formula:

where: %AA—percentage amino acid content in the whole
TREMBL database (Fig. 1), %nAA—theoretical content of a
dipeptide (n=2) or a tripeptide (n: 3).

The major reason for the discrepancy of correlation between the
theoretically calculated number of di- or tripeptides is that a lot
of sequences with unknown amino acids (‘X’ or Alx ‘B’ and Glx
‘Z’), not included in the analysis, occur in the UNIPROT—TREMBL
database. The programme deletes all di- or tripeptides which contain
X, B or Z amino acids.

Amino acid and di- and tripeptide counting was performed for
selected species similar to that for the whole TREMBL database.
Figures 4—6 shows amino acid, di- and tripeptide distribution for
H.sapiens and its selected enzymes. The distribution for the other
species from the Table is available in the Supplemental Material.

When the TREMBL database is divided into species and enzyme
classes, amino acid distribution close to theoretical number is
obtained.

It is noted that amino acid content in a species decreases with the
length of its biosynthesis pathway. Due to this, certain sequences
occur more frequently, while other very rarely or not at all. A
number of natural toxins, metabolites and protein inhibitors are
composed of polypeptides or their natural modiﬁcations. It can be
then argued that processed and highly hydrolyzed food was the
ﬁrst source of inhibitors and natural medicines which protected
species against fungi, bacteria and viruses. Many authors claim
that food processing (heat treatment) contributed to the rapid brain
development (Gibbons, 2007; Milton, 1999).

5 SUMMARY

Our calculation results prove that the number of di- and tripeptide
sequences is consistent with their theoretical number calculated
based on the amino acid content in the TREMBL database. This
results from the fact that amino acids have similar or even identical
biosynthesis pathways in different species. Therefore, the number
of amino acids and their combinations (polypeptides) is generally
similar. Short sequences do not occur or do so only rarely and
this opens up new opportunities for searching for natural protein
inhibitors based on polypeptide structures and their modiﬁcations.
Many toxins, immunosuppressants and inhibitors have a well-
deﬁned polypeptide fragment in their structure. Our calculations
provide a new strategy for inhibitor design based on short natural
amino acid sequences (Braddon et al., 2010; Eitner et al., 2009; Cai
et al., 2002).

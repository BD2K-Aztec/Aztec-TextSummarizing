ABSTRACT

Motivation: The commercial launch of 454 pyrosequencing in 2005
was a milestone in genome sequencing in terms of performance and
cost. Throughout the three available releases, average read lengths
have increased to ~500 base pairs and are thus approaching read
lengths obtained from traditional Sanger sequencing. Study design
of sequencing projects would benefit from being able to simulate
experiments.

Results: We explore 454 raw data to investigate its characteristics
and derive empirical distributions for the flow values generated by
pyrosequencing. Based on our findings, we implement Flowsim,
a simulator that generates realistic pyrosequencing data files of
arbitrary size from a given set of input DNA sequences. We finally
use our simulator to examine the impact of sequence lengths on the
results of concrete whole-genome assemblies, and we suggest its
use in planning of sequencing projects, benchmarking of assembly
methods and other fields.

1 INTRODUCTION

During the last few years novel sequencing technologies have been
introduced. The platforms that are currently commercially available
are marketed by Roche (454), Illumina (Solexa/Genome Analyzer),
and Applied Biosystems (SOLiD), and they give new challenges
for bioinformatics due to data volumes, short read lengths, and
difference in errors and quality compared to traditional Sanger
sequencing. So far, most bioinformatics methods available have been
developed for Sanger sequencing data.

In this article, we characterize the data produced by the 454 system
and in particular by its latest version named GS FLX Titanium
(referred to as Titanium in the rest of the article). We analyze
Titanium data sets from genomes for which the sequence has been
determined. Speciﬁcally, we map each Titanium read to the reference
and derive empirical distributions for the ﬂowgram data obtained
(see below; Table 1). This provides an improved basis for analysis
and algorithm design, e.g. for base calling and alignment. In this
article, we present a simulator that generates realistic ﬂowgram data
for any chosen DNA sequence.

The article is structured as follows: in the rest of Section 1,
we brieﬂy summarize pyrosequencing, specialized methods for
analyzing pyrosequencing data (operating in ‘ﬂowspace’, see

Section 1.2), and simulations. Section 2 follows the results obtained
from characterizing pyrosequencing data at the ﬂow level, and in
Section 3, we present the Flowsim simulator and some results
obtained from comparing simulated and real data sets. Finally, in
Section 4 a discussion is given.

1.1 Pyrosequencing

The 454 pyrosequencing technology is based on sequencing-by-
synthesis and consists in the cyclic ﬂowing of nucleotide reagents
(repeatedly ﬂowing T, A, C, G) over a PicoTiterPlateTM. The plate
consists of approximately one million wells, and each well contains
at most one bead carrying a copy of a unique single-stranded
DNA fragment to be sequenced. When the ﬂowed nucleotide is
complementary to the template strand in a well, the existing DNA
strand in this well is extended with additional nucleotide(s) by a
polymerase. This hybridization results in a reaction that generates
an observable light signal which is recorded by a camera. The
light intensity is converted into a ‘ﬂow value’, a two-decimal non-
negative number that is proportional to the length of a homopolymer
run, i.e. it designates the number of nucleotides included in the
ﬂow, estimated by simply rounding the number to the closest integer
(Margulies et al., 2005).

The term ‘noise ﬂow values’ (in literature sometimes referred
to as ‘negative ﬂow values’, in practical terms being between 0
and 0.49) means that the light signal—although existing—is weak
and judged not to result from a chemical reaction. A ‘positive ﬂow
value’ thus indicates incorporation of at least one base, and the
number of bases (the homopolymer length) is determined from the
ﬂow value. Flow values for one bead (one read) can be used to plot
a ﬂowgram (Fig. 1a) from which the associated sequence can be
determined.

The cyclically ﬂowed nucleotides and the corresponding ﬂow
values build the basis for not only base calling, but also per-base
quality score calculation (integrated in Titanium output). Obviously,
the key to a correct base calling lies in the accuracy of the
light signals. The 454 methodology differs from traditional Sanger
sequencing in that substitution errors are a lot less frequent than
insertions or deletions. Data properties have slightly changed over
the three 454 generations (Roche Applied Science, 2008). We focus
on the Titanium technology for all further calculations.

1.2 Use of ﬂow values in data analysis

Although 454 sequences can be analyzed as Fasta ﬁles with standard
bioinformatics tools, the ﬂow values contain information that is not
available in the pure nucleotide sequence. Consequently, several

groups have proposed algorithms to utilize ﬂow values directly.
This approach is referred to as operating in ‘ﬂowspace’ as opposed
to ‘nucleotide space’ and inhibits information loss. For example, the
PyroNoise method (Quince et (11., 2009) uses a maximum likelihood
approach to decide whether a set of ﬂowgrams is likely to result
from one or several distinct underlying biological sequences. In an
analogous manner, using Bayesian statistics, the PyroBayes method
(Quinlan et (11., 2008) determines the length of each homopolymer
run as the most likely number of bases given the observed ﬂow
value. If the probability for an extra base exceeds a certain threshold,
the extra base is added to the homopolymer run. This increases the
number of insertion errors, but decreases the number of deletions
and substitutions since it is intrinsic to 454 pyrosequencing that
substitution errors can only arise from coherent over- and undercalls.
This tendency to call more bases in homopolymer runs thus enables
a higher SNP identiﬁcation rate.

For small RNA discovery, direct mapping of ﬂowgrams against a
target genome (‘FLAT’, ﬂowgram alignment tool) has been proved
to be an efﬁcient method (Vacic et (11., 2008). It is also possible
to achieve higher per-base accuracy rates in sequence assembly by
building consensus sequences in ﬂowspace from highly oversampled
data (Huse et (11., 2007; Margulies et (11., 2005). Metagenomics
is another ﬁeld where the quality of 454-pyrosequenced data has
received much attention (Gomez-Alvarez et (11., 2009; Huson et (11.,
2007; Quince et (11., 2009).

Studies have shown that there are several artifacts that heavily
inﬂuence the processing of data for different purposes (Gomez-
Alvarez et (11 ., 2009; Huse et (11., 2007), and especially methods that
do not directly use ﬂow values are sensitive to the characteristics of
pyrosequencing data. For example, when matching 454 sequences
with an indexing approach one can collapse all homopolymer

subsequences to length one since pyrosequencing is likely to
introduce errors in homopolymer lengths (Miller et (11., 2008).

Especially for long homopolymers, many errors are caused by
broad and overlapping signal distributions leading to ambiguous
base calls, although there has also been work on improving 454
sequencing from the chemical aspect (Margulies et (11., 2005). In
addition to the correct determination of homopolymer lengths, the
under- or over-calling of bases is especially critical for weak light
signals (i.e. noise ﬂow values). A ﬂow value of 0.49 is treated as noise
by the 454 base caller although it is almost as likely to originate from
a single base call.

1.3 Simulating shotgun data

With Genfrag (Engle and Burks, 1994) and celsim (Myers, 1999),
there have been earlier attempts to simulate shotgun read data, but,
to the best of our knowledge, MetaSIM (Richter et (11., 2008) is
the only simulator that allows for generating 454 pyrosequencing
data. MetaSIM targets Metagenomics. Internally, it uses parametric
models for simulating ﬂow values, but its output is Fasta ﬁles, and
thus it is of limited use for applications that operate in ﬂowspace.

2 FLOW VALUE DISTRIBUTIONS

One of the main challenges in 454 pyrosequencing is the correct
determination of homopolymer lengths from ﬂow values. The
latter originate from a mixture of overlapping distributions. This is
illustrated in Figures 1b and 3, where each distribution is assigned
to one homopolymer length and one distribution to noise values.
Incorrect homopolymer lengths lead to insertions and deletions
during base calling (relative to the underlying biological sequence),

and, when an over-call follows an under-call or vice versa, to a
perceived substitution error. Therefore, if the distributions did not
overlap, this would mean an error-free sequencing. An improved
understanding of these distributions also improves the basis for
designing algorithms that target the analysis of 454 pyrosequencing
data.

2.1 Parametric versus empirical approaches

In earlier studies one has approximated ﬂow values by normal,
log-normal (Margulies et (11., 2005) or non-central student’s
t distributions (Quinlan et (11., 2008). However, for our data the ﬁt of
these distributions is not satisfying (Fig. 3). An alternative is to use
non-parametric empirical distributions estimated from real Titanium
data for which reference sequences are available. By mapping 454
data to the originating genome, we characterize the distributions of
ﬂow values coming from each homopolymer length.

2.2 Sequence comparisons

After having compared Titanium raw data from two different species,
Escherichia coli and seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax, referred to as
E.c01i and D.1(1br(1x, respectively in the rest of the article), we
decided to combine them—equally weighted—into one empirical
distribution per homopolymer length. However, we also decided to
include the four different nucleotide types in the same distributions
since they appear to give rise to very similar distributions. In
order to ﬁnd the distribution of ﬂow values that arises from one
particular homopolymer length, we mapped Titanium ﬂowgrams to
a reference genome for the same organism, based on one Titanium
plate each for an E.c01i K-12 strain (Blattner et (11., 1997) and
D.1(1br(1x (Kuhl et (11 ., 2010). We used BLAST (Altschul et (11., 1990)
to identify the location of reads that could be aligned unambiguously
to one location on the genome, with default BLAST parameters,
except for gap open and extend penalties, which were set to l.

To distinguish sequencing errors from true biological variation, we
used a bit score threshold of 200 and only the best match for each
sequence. Furthermore, we discarded all those matches that had
a corresponding second best match with a bit score <5% worse
than the best match, i.e. two matches with bit scores that were
approximately equally high.

For E.c01i, there were uncertainties in terms of which reference
genome to choose, as none of the available reference genomes gave
us >97% identity with the pyrosequencing data, but the match
ﬁltering mentioned above should account for these problems.

2.3 Calculation of empirical distributions

We aligned the ﬂowgrams to the matching genomic region, assigning
each ﬂow value to the corresponding true homopolymer length as
known from the reference genome. Thus, we collected the ﬂow
values assigned to each homopolymer length distribution from 0
to 5, as shown in Figure 3.

For homopolymer lengths greater than 5, our data is sparse,
and it is therefore better to approximate the real distributions
by extrapolating parametric distributions from the shorter
homopolymer lengths. Table 2 shows the observed mean and
standard deviation of the empirical distributions for homopolymer
lengths 0 to 5, and the linear regression for these parameters based
on normal distributions ﬁtted to homopolymer lengths 1 to 5.

2.4 Degradation and Noise

We ﬁnd our resulting empirical distributions to be almost
symmetrical around the corresponding integers, with relatively low
standard deviation for short homopolymer runs. However, when
analyzing data from the three 454 generations, we also found that
the degree of symmetry varies between them. Quinlan et (11. (2008)
report a signiﬁcantly higher insertion than deletion rate, which is
consistent with an asymmetry in the tails of the distributions, but we
found the asymmetry to decrease towards newer generation data.

Nevertheless, we can clearly observe two kinds of degradation:
since standard deviation increases for increasing homopolymer
lengths, these belong to broader distributions with overlapping
tails, where the latter generally means a higher risk of over- and
under-calls.

Second, analysis of the ﬂow values associated with sequence
parts that have been trimmed off (during standard 454 quality-
trimming) indicates that 454 quality-ﬁltering and -trimming
calibrates discrepancies between the four nucleotides and increases
the separations of the distributions, involving deeper valleys

between them (Figs 1b and 2a). We therefore use only the
subsequences retained after quality-trimming to estimate the
empirical distributions, thus being able to treat the nucleotides
equally. Also for quality-trimmed raw data, we can see that both
read and ﬂow position of a base have a remarkable inﬂuence on the
accuracy of ﬂow values. We have observed a clear degradation in
accuracy over the length of a run, i.e. when comparing earlier to

later ﬂow cycles, by measuring for each ﬂow cycle how much the
difference between a ﬂow value and its ideal counterpart (i.e. the
closest integer) varies (Fig. 2b).

2.5 Read lengths

The length of un-trimmed reads in 454 pyrosequencing is limited
by either the number of ﬂows (168 in GS20, 400 in GS FLX and
800 in GS FLX Titanium) or the length of the clones. The longest
reads are thus obtained when the clone length exceeds the number
of ﬂows, such that the DNA strands in the well are extended until
the very last ﬂow cycle.

As quality decreases towards the end of a read, several ﬁlters
are applied on the reads, which again gives a different read length
distribution. We can thus distinguish between the distribution of
clone lengths, the distribution of read lengths before ﬁltering and
quality-trimming and that after application of those ﬁlters. A detailed
description of the ﬁltering algorithms is given in the 454 manual
(Roche Applied Science, 2008). As visible in Figure 1b, they
eliminate (some of the) artifacts in the distributions by trimming
low-quality ﬂow values from the end of each read.

3 FLOWSIM—A SIMULATOR FOR 454 DATA

To take advantage of the empirical distributions, we implemented
Flowsim, a simulator for pyrosequencing data.

3.1 Implementation of Flowsim

Given an input sequence in Fasta format, Flowsim selects substrings
of this sequence with random position and strand, and generates a
ﬂowgrarn by converting the nucleotide sequences to sequences of
homopolymer lengths. Each homopolymer length is then altered
according to its ﬂow distribution, where the latter is allowed to vary
(degrade) with the ﬂow position in the simulated read. To emulate
degradation, we derived 20 different sets of empirical distributions
from our mapping results (Fig. 3), where each of them represents
10 consecutive Titanium ﬂow cycles, which sums up to 800 ﬂow
values.

The simulated ﬂowgram is then analyzed to call nucleotide
sequence and quality scores. Finally, all generated information is
stored in an SFF ﬁle, similar to the ones produced by the 454
software.

One can ﬁirther specify the number of desired output reads and
also incorporate user-deﬁned empirical distributions, either position-
speciﬁc (degrading) or not.

3.2 Quality scores

It is crucial to assign a quality score to each called base, since
sequenced bases are not ﬁltered individually during quality-ﬁltering
and -trimming, but rather in the context of their reads. Quality scores
are e.g. useﬁil for assembly projects, although some assemblers do
not use them. If they do, however, they might rely on them for
incorporating Sanger reads since 454 quality scores are expressed as
a phred equivalent (Margulies et (11., 2005; Roche Applied Science,
2008). On the other hand, scores can also be used by assemblers
built for Sanger sequences when assembling 454 sequences.
Although the method for determining quality has been described
both for GS20 (Margulies et (11., 2005) and Titanium (Brockman
et (11., 2008), the exact parameters are not known. Instead, Flowsim

calculates the error probability (‘the base in question is an over-
call’), using Bayes’ Theorem, and transfers it into a phred equivalent.
Thus, the quality score corresponds to the true quality of the
simulated base call, rather than to the quality the 454 software would
produce for the same ﬂowgram.

Flowsim currently supports two quality calling methods based on
Bayesian statistics. One produces decreasing quality scores for the
bases in a homopolymer, similar to GS20. The second produces
a series of identical values for each base in a homopolymer, as
in Titanium, but otherwise builds on the same Bayesian approach
as the GS20 algorithm. Compared to the quality scores assigned
to Titanium by the Roche analysis pipeline, our quality scores are
lower. As GS20 appears to use a ﬁxed table mapping each ﬂow value
to a set of qualities, there is also a third option of assigning qualities
from a table derived from GS20 data.

Bayes’ theorem requires both the prior probability for each
homopolymer length and the conditional probability for a ﬂow value
given a certain homopolymer length. In contrast to Margulies et (11.,
we use both empirical priors (from the input Fasta ﬁle) and empirical
conditional probabilities (from our empirical distributions). This
allows us to assess the quality of our simulated data as accurately
as possible. When position-speciﬁc empirical distributions are used
in Flowsim, we also use these for quality score calculation.

3.3 Simulating data sets

We used Flowsim to generate synthetic data sets, using our empirical
distributions as the ﬂow model. Each of the 20 distributions was
used for 10 ﬂow cycles (40 ﬂows), giving a realistic degradation of
quality along the sequence. We also simulated data sets using 400
ﬂow cycles, simulating a hypothetical 454 generation with twice the
read length of the current Titanium generation. The E.c01i genome
(K- 12 strain, GenBank ID: 49175990) was used as the input genome.

3.4 Simulation results

We have performed both de-novo and reference-based assembly
using Newbler assembler version 2.3 (Roche), approximating
various coverage (1X, 5X, 10X, 15X, 20X, 25X and 30x). A
simulation with 200 ﬂow cycles shows ~l% inferred error, while
400 ﬂow cycles result in an error rate of ~0.8%, which is the same
as for the real data (Titanium, i.e. 200 ﬂow cycles).

Our results indicate that Flowsim can be useful to estimate the
quality of an assembly that can be expected from using Titanium
to shotgun sequence a genome. However, the assemblies resulting
from our simulations were consistently better in terms of contig
sizes (through the N50 summarizing statistic, see Table 3) for
the simulated data sets than for the real ones. This may partly
be due to all simulated reads coming from the reference genome
and thus avoiding strain-speciﬁc discrepancies, which leads to
the fact that 100% of the reads for 200 and 400 ﬂow cycle
simulations can be mapped back to genome, while real data reach
only ~98.7% for all studied coverage values. There may also be
other factors such as possible biases in terms of genome coverage
in the experimental protocols used to generate the shotgun libraries
for Titanium sequencing. Further work will include exploring such
biases and other sources of variability as well as characterizing their
inﬂuence on the simulation accuracy of Flowsim. Also Flowsim
will be extended to include simulation of paired-reads, which will
be of high value for simulation and planning of projects for de-novo
whole-genome sequencing.

4 DISCUSSION

This study aims to sketch the opportunities that arise from
analyzing pyrosequencing raw data, culminating in the use of
empirical distributions. The empirical distributions give us a very
realistic picture of the underlying characteristics of the light signal
values that are later translated into DNA sequences. In contrast,
earlier approaches to modeling ﬂow data have built on parametric

distributions, and the same distributions were used for whole reads,
without respect to ﬂow or read positions.

Our ﬁndings and the empirical distributions are based on large
amounts of data from three different species (E.c01i, D.1(1br(1x,
Gadus morhua), four sequencing labs, both shotgun and paired-
end reads with different gap sizes. The empirical ﬂow value
distributions are very similar, and we have not observed any
factors which inﬂuence the shape of the distributions apart from
the 454 generation. Thus, we have a good reason to believe that the
distributions used in Flowsim are representative.

The ﬂow values that result from 454 sequencing exhibit many
interesting characteristics and artifacts, and we do not address them
all here. Some of these are generation-speciﬁc, some of them have
remained stable over the years, and some of them only appear
on one certain plate, for one certain species or in one lab. One
known artifact, exact or almost-exact duplicates, has been not only
described for metagenomics in the literature (Gomez-Alvarez et (11 .,
2009), but we also observed them in shotgun sequences for E.c01i
and D.1(1br(1x.

We do emulate the degradation in empirical ﬂow distributions, and
we also calculate the corresponding quality scores. In contrast, we
neglect some of the artifacts that we have observed in the empirical
distributions, but are not able to interpret properly yet, such as for
example: shifts in peaks that lead to systematic over- or under-calls,
jumps, neighboring peaks, i.e. subpeaks around the next or preceding
integer. These are particularly strong for the noise distribution (with a
neighboring peak around 1) and the 1-distribution (with neighboring
peaks around 0.1 and 2), but the values causing these peaks are not
many in number. Analyzing the corresponding data including the
related alignments we found that the subpeaks are likely to be caused
by real biological differences. This will be explored further in a

separate study. In this context, we also performed a weak smoothing
process that helped to reduce subpeaks and jumps.

Furthermore, the 454 image analysis software implements a
set of quality ﬁlters that sets trimming coordinates to identify
the high-quality part of each read. In addition, some reads are
eliminated entirely based on quality metrics. Although these ﬁlters
are documented (Roche Applied Science, 2008), the documentation
is not sufﬁcient to re-implement them, and the current version of
Flowsim does not attempt to simulate them. We hope to address this
in a future release (Fig. 4).

In conclusion, our simulator produces sufﬁciently realistic 454
ﬁles as we model all important phenomena that we have observed.
Furthermore, Flowsim allows the user to specify many of its
parameters, making it adaptable to new real or hypothetical 454
generations.

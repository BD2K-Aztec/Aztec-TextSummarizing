ABSTRACT

Motivation: Next-generation sequencing technologies enable
the identification of sequence variation in the genome and
transcriptome. Differences between the reference genome and
transcript libraries complicate the determination of the effect
of genomic sequence variants on protein products; similarly,
these differences complicate the mapping of sequence variants
found in transcripts to their respective genomic position. We
have developed MU2A, a publicly available web service for
variant annotation that reconciles differences between the
genome and transcriptome, enabling the rapid and accurate
determination of the effects of genomic variants on protein
products, and the mapping of variants detected in transcripts
to genomic coordinates. The MU2A web service is available at
http://krauthammerlab.med.yale.edu/mu2a. We have released MU2A
as open source, available at http://code.google.com/p/mu2a/.

1 INTRODUCTION

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies enable researchers
to identify sequence variants in both germline and disease tissue
DNA. In DNA-Seq experiments, genomic DNA is sequenced,
and aligned to a reference genome. Variants are detected by
identifying the reads with alternative bases compared with the
reference. In RNA-Seq, which is primarily intended to identify
differential gene expression, CDNA is sequenced and aligned to a
reference transcript library. Common downstream processing steps
for DNA-Seq experiments include the mapping of the variants to
their transcript positions to determine effects on protein function.
Common downstream processing steps for RNA-Seq experiments
include the mapping of transcript variants to genomic coordinates to
determine conservation of the corresponding regions. For both steps,
it is imperative to consider conﬂicts between the reference genome
and transcript libraries. The consensus sequence for the reference
genome is determined from the DNA of only a few individuals,

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

while the RefSeq transcript library represents a consensus across
a vast number of mRNA sequences deposited in GenBank. The
most obvious difference can be found at known single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) positions, where the reference genome may
show the minor allele, and the transcript library the major allele (and
vice versa). Other differences include insertions or deletions (indels),
or rare single base variants. We have developed MU2A, a variant
assessment tool that accepts either genomic or transcript positions
and reconciles the discordance between the reference genome and
transcriptome when predicting the effects of sequence variants.

MU2A rapidly and accurately determines the effects of genomic
variants on transcripts and proteins; determines the genomic context
of variants detected in transcripts; ﬂags variants with genome
transcript misalignments; annotates variants that correspond to
known SNPs or known cancer mutations; annotates variants with
information on genomic conservation, gene function and determines
effect on domain integrity.

2 METHODS

MU2A supports the NCBI version 36.1 (hg18) and GRCh37 (hg19) human
genome builds, and NCBI RefSeq as the reference transcript library
(Pruitt at al., 2007). We currently focus on single nucleotide variants, as
they represent the majority of naturally occurring sequence variants. We
constructed a base-to-base mapping between the genome and transcriptome
using UCSC’S RefSeq mapping as a scaffold (Kent at al., 2002). This
mapping allows us to accurately determine the effect of genomic variants
on transcripts, and to determine the genomic context of variants found in
transcripts. The methods described are applicable to other organisms, genome
builds and transcript libraries.

2.1 Reconciling the genome and transcriptome

To analyze differences between the genome and transcriptome, we
constructed genome-based predicted transcripts by concatenating genomic
sequences from GRCh37 according to exon boundaries posted by the
UCSC genome browser. We then aligned predicted transcript sequences to
RefSeq sequences using the NeedlemaniWunsch global alignment algorithm
(Needleman and Wunsch, 1970). We found that 17.8% of all RefSeq
transcripts differ from the predicted transcript sequence (Fig. 1): 3.5%
align with gaps, 16.2% with substitutions and 1.9% with both gaps and
substitutions. 13.2% of RefSeq transcripts align to predicted transcripts
with substitutions that correspond to known SNPS. The predicted transcripts
used here are dependent on the genomic coordinates of the UCSC exon
boundaries, and are a result of UCSC’S RefSeq to genome mapping

procedure. In order to exclude any bias introduced by this mapping
procedure, we repeated our calculations with RefSeq transcripts for which
both the UCSC mapping as well as an alternative NCBI mapping resulted
in exactly the same exon boundaries and predicted transcripts. These
‘consensus’ predicted transcripts exhibited similar discrepancies to the
RefSeq sequences as discussed above (refer to Supplementary Material
for details). MU2A uses information on predicted transcript to RefSeq
misalignments to ﬂag submitted variants that correspond to known single
base differences between the genome and transcriptome, or that correspond
to base differences due to gaps. For the latter, MU2A attempts to adjust the
positional mappings if possible (see Supplementary Material for a speciﬁc
example).

2.2 Variants at known SNP positions

We found that compared with the transcript library, the reference genome
often contains the minor allele of known SNPS. 3634 SNPS are found at
positions within the 4910 transcripts where RefSeq and the genome differ
(a single SNP may affect multiple transcripts). 1744 of these SNPS have a
clear major allele, identical across all populations as determined by dbSNP
build 131 (Sherry at al., 2001). For 77% of these SNPS, the RefSeq transcript
bears the major allele, whereas for 23%, the genome bears the major allele.
MU2A therefore uses RefSeq as the reference sequence for transcribed
regions, as it is more likely to bear the major allele. MU2A ﬂags genomic
‘Variants’ at SNP positions that result in a transcript identical to RefSeq.
MU2A annotates sequence variants for every SNP position and provides
allele frequencies, simplifying the identiﬁcation of sequence variants that
represent minor alleles.

2.3 Assessing the functional consequences of sequence
variants

One common goal of NGS is to ﬁnd sequence variants that cause
disease. To facilitate this effort, MU2A annotates mutations with the
following information: Conservationgconservation score from the 17 or
46-way phylogenetic alignment track of the UCSC genome browser (Kent
at al., 2002); Gene Functioniincludes GO annotations (Ashburner at al.,
2000), Panther Pathways (Mi at al., 2007), Cancer Gene Census (Futreal
at al., 2004), Pfam Domain (Bateman at al., 2004); Missense mutation
effectsiincludes Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC)
(Bamford at al., 2004), BLOSUM45 (Henikoff and Henikoff. 1992), Panther
cSNP analysis (Thomas and Kejariwal, 2004) and LogR.E Score (Clifford
at al., 2004).

(Pleasance et al., 2010). MU2A rapidly annotated all 33 000 variants
from this dataset in 2 min; processing the computationally expensive
cSNP and LogR.E analyses required an additional 20 min. Pleasance
et al. classiﬁed mutations as silent, missense, nonsense, intronic and
intergenic using Ensembl, version 52. MU2A classiﬁed mutation
effects using RefSeq; agreement was very high (95%, refer to the
Supplementary Material for details). Pleasance et al. used dbSNP
build 129 to identify substitutions at known SNPs. For genome
build 36.1, MU2A uses dbSNP build 130 and the 1000 genome
project, providing greater coverage of known sequence variants,
thereby allowing the identiﬁcation of additional substitutions that
correspond to known SNPs (1.8% of total substitutions). To
facilitate the identiﬁcation of deleterious sequence variants, MU2A
annotated variants with conservation score, gene function, pathway
information and impact on protein function (refer to Supplementary
Material). In summary, MU2A rapidly processed substitutions,
accurately classiﬁed mutation effects and identiﬁed variants that
correspond to SNPs for the melanoma genome.

3.2 User interface

The user interface allows the submission of both the genomic or
transcript position of sequence variants, making the tool equally
useful for variant annotation from DNA- or RNA-seq data. Variants
can be pasted in a text ﬁeld or uploaded from a ﬁle from a
local computer (Fig. 2). Users have the choice of performing the
analysis with or without the CPU-intensive LogR.E and cSNP
analysis. The MU2A WebService provides results in tab-delimited
and excel formats. The excel spreadsheet can be easily ﬁltered and
is hyperlinked to external databases, simplifying the analysis of
sequence variants.

Other web-based variant annotation tools include Mutalyzer,
SNPNexus, Mutation Assessor (http://xvar.org/), SeattleSeq
Annotation (http://gvs.gs.washington.edu/SeattleSqunnotation/)
and the Genomic Mutation Consequence Calculator (Chelala
et al., 2009; Major, 2007; Wildeman et al., 2008). To the best
of our knowledge, no other publicly available variant annotation
web service accounts for the misalignment between the genome
and transcriptome. Another noteworthy feature of MU2A is its
availability as open source, allowing local deployment.

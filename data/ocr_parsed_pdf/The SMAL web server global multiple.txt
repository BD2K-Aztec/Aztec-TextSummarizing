Abstract

Motivation: Alignments of protein—protein interaction networks (PPIN) can be used to predict
protein function, study conserved aspects of the interactome, and to establish evolutionary corres—
pondences. Within this problem context, determining multiple network alignments (MNA) is a sig—
nificant challenge that involves high computational complexity. A limited number of public MNA
implementations are available currently and the majority of the pairwise network alignment (PNA)
algorithms do not have MNA counterparts. Furthermore, current MNA algorithms do not allow
choosing a specific PPIN relative to which an MNA could be constructed. Also, once an MNA is ob—
tained, it cannot easily be modified, such as through addition of a new network, without expensive
re—computation of the entire MNA.

Results: SMAL (Scaffold—Based Multiple Network Aligner) is a public, open—source, web—based appli—
cation for determining MNAs from existing PNAs that addresses all the aforementioned challenges.
With SMAL, PNAs can be combined rapidly to obtain an MNA. The software also supports visualiza—
tion and user—data interactions to facilitate exploratory analysis and sensemaking. SMAL is especially
useful when multiple alignments relative to a particular PPIN are required; furthermore, SMAL align—
ments are persistent in that existing correspondences between networks (obtained during PNA or
MNA) are not lost as new networks are added. In comparative studies alongside existent MNA tech—
niques, SMAL MNAs were found to be superior per a number of measures, such as the total number
of identified homologs and interologs as well as the fraction of all identified correspondences that
are functionally similar or homologous to the scaffold. While directed primarily at PPIN—alignment,
SMAL is a generic network aligner and may be applied to arbitrary networks.

1 Introduction

Network alignment, in both the pairwise alignment and multiple
network alignment (MNA) formulations, is an NP—hard problem.
Of these formulations, in practice, MNA requires significantly
greater time to compute. Understandably therefore, at the state—of—
the—art, the number of pairwise network alignment (PNA) algo—
rithms and software significantly surpasses those for MNA.

However, with increasing availability of interactomes, the ability to
compare PPINs across species through MNA becomes increasingly
critical for a spectrum of problems including identification of
conserved functional components, function prediction and phylo—
genetics. SMAL (Scaffold—Based Multiple Network Aligner) incorp—
orates a number of operational and theoretical novelties: (i) unlike
current MNA methods, it allows MNA construction with respect to

a specific network of interest (called the scaffold), which can be se—
lected based on domain knowledge or other characteristics, such as
representativeness or phylogenetic significance. (ii) In determining
the MNA, PNAs with respect to the scaffold can be computed using
arbitrary PNA algorithms. This property allows SMAL to utilize the
large number of specialized PNA methods that currently exist. (iii)
SMAL MNAs are invariant to the order in which the PNAs are
incorporated. (iv) SMAL MNAs are progressively persistent, in that,
network correspondences already part of the MNA are not altered
as new networks are added (Supplementary Section S1). (v) SMAL
has linear—time complexity with respect to the number of networks
being aligned (Supplementary Section S2), leading to extremely fast
MNA computations in practice, and (vi) the MNA obtained with
SMAL can be related to the constituent pairwise alignments in a
straightforward manner, aiding interpretability.

2 Algorithmic underpinnings of SMAL

In the following, we summarize the key algorithmic steps in SMAL;
an illustrative example is presented in Figure 1. A detailed algorithmic
treatment can be found in Dohrmann et al. (2015 ). Given m net—
works, let GS: (E5, V5), denote a (designated) scaffold. Let also m-1
pairwise alignments between the scaffold and each of the remaining
networks be computed using arbitrary PNA method(s). In SMAL, the
resulting m-1 PNAs are related to each other as follows: for each node
17 6 VS, all nodes corresponding to it in any of the PNAs are combined
into a single group P(p), to represent the entire set of protein corres—
pondences. Forming the union over pairwise alignments induces a re—
lationship between nodes aligned to the same scaffold protein, which
is termed weak correspondence transitivity (WCT). The biological
relevance of WCT was investigated in Dohrmann et al. (2015 ) and
additional results are summarized in Supplementary Section S3 and
Tables S1 and S2. To determine the induced edges (conserved

does not have an interaction between node 3 (RFC38) and node 4 (CGS142).
The H. sapiens and C. elegans subnetworks however, contain an interaction
between the corresponding homologs. Consequently, the MNA can be used
to hypothesize an analogous PPI in D. melanogaster. Supporting this hypoth-
esis, STRING v10 (Szklarczyk et al., 2015) lists the interaction between RFC38
and CGS142 with high confidence (0.999). (G) The functional similarity

interactions), for each interaction 1' in G5, 1' : (u, v) E E5, the
Cartesian product of the nodes aligned with the interacting partners :4
and v is computed and tuples that form an interaction in a PPIN par—
ticipating in the MNA are retained. The set of conserved interactions
for a given scaffold interaction 1' : (u, v) is therefore expressed as:

I(i : (u,u)) : {(kJ) e P(u) >< P(U)E|t: (k,l) e a} (1)

It may be noted that a subset of conserved interactions can be com—
puted using Equation (1) even if certain interactions are absent in spe—
cific PPINs, making SMAL robust to missing data. During network
alignment, any measure of node—node similarity (e.g. BLAST bit
scores) can be provided to create biologically more relevant corres—
pondences. In absence of such information, SMAL determines the
alignments purely using network topology. Determining MNAs in
SMAL can be accomplished extremely rapidly, taking only few se—
conds even for large networks. Given m networks, the speedup in
SMAL compared to native MNA implementations can be attributed
to the lower operational complexity of computing m-1 pairwise align—
ments and then combining them as opposed to directly determining a
single MNA. Furthermore, given the mutual independence of PNAs
used in SMAL, their computation can be easily parallelized. Actual
computation times depend largely on the employed pairwise align—
ment algorithm and can range from minutes to several hours with
observed speedups ranging between 1.5 up to 50 for SMAL versus na—
tive MNA implementations (Supplementary Section S4 and Table S3).

3 The SMAL web server

The SMAL web server is implemented using python—CGI. Its key modules
and workflow are depicted in Figure 2. Examples of input and output ﬁle
formats are summarized in Table 1 and expanded upon in Supplementary
Section S5 and Fig. S1. Brieﬂy, network and alignment ﬁles are simple space
or tab delimited text. In a network ﬁle each line describes one interaction,
while in an alignment ﬁle (created by an arbitrary PNA algorithm), each
line contains a cluster with two or more corresponding nodes. Typically,
nodes are encoded using protein names or accession numbers.

To create SMAL MNAs, first, the constituent networks and their
pairwise alignments with the scaffold have to be uploaded.
Subsequently, SMAL computes multiple alignment files for nodes
where each line lists a scaffold node together with all nodes aligned

Fig. 3. Visualization of a 4-species MNA of Rattus norvegicus (scaffold), Homo
sapiens, Mus musculus and Drosophila melanogaster. A well-conserved clus-
ter of proteins related to ion-channel regulation around P62161 (Calmodulin
in R. norvegicus) is shown. Each vertex represents an alignment cluster and
is labeled with the accession number of the scaffold protein. Both vertex size
and the weight of interactions increase with the level of conservation.
Additionally, each species in the MNA is associated with an inlaid color in the
vertex. Clicking a vertex displays details about the constitution of the corres-
ponding alignment cluster and provides tools to modify and explore the
alignment

in any of the PNAs. Based on this MNA node alignment, edge align—
ments listing scaffold interactions together with all induced inter—
actions as identified by Equation (1) are generated. Both, node and
edge alignment files are created as a labeled version where each
node is appended with a label indicating the network of origin as
well as a plain version without such extra mark—up. Additional in—
formation including basic statistics to quantify alignments, such as
the percentage of scaffold nodes and edges that have correspond—
ences at different levels of conservation, is provided.

In addition to supporting the core algorithms for creating and mod—
ifying MNAs, the web server either directly integrates or links—to a num—
ber of PNA methods, including SMETANA (Sahraeian and Yoon,
2013), IsoRankN (Liao et 41]., 2009), NETAL (Neyshabur et 41]., 2013)
and PINALOG (Phan and Sternberg, 2012). Finally, online visualization
and user—data interactions with the MNAs are supported via the cyto—
scape.js library (Franz et 41]., 2016). The computed MNA is displayed as
a network where each vertex represents a scaffold node together with
all the network vertices aligned to it. To assist in visual assimilation of
the information, colors are inlaid inside the scaffold vertices to summar—
ize the underlying alignment. Scaffold interactions are rendered together
with color—coded edges to represent induced interactions. The visualiza—
tion module supports searching for proteins, local filtering of aligned
neighborhoods based on conservation, and also includes functionality
to investigate the neighborhood of selected proteins (Fig. 3).

 

IR, IsoRankN; SM, SMETANA. Results are for an alignment of seven
PPINs (Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster, Mus musculus, Rattus nor-
vegicus, Caenorhabditis elegans, Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevi-
siae). NForHs counts aligned proteins that are homologous or functionally
similar. EFong counts conserved interactions between homologous or func—
tionally similar proteins. EAS represents the raw number of all conserved
interactions. EA—3 counts the scaffold interactions that are conserved in at
least three distinct PPINs. Results are averaged over all possible scaffold
choices. Best values are bolded. SMAL outperforms IR and SM for most
measures. The performance of SMAL degrades for measures that focus on the
interrelation between non—scaffold networks. For such cases, existing MNA
techniques may match or outperform SMAL as demonstrated by the EA—3
measure for SM.

3.1 Experiments and validation

SMAL alignments tend to be superior to alignments obtained
with current MNA algorithms such as IsoRankN and SMETANA
(Table 2). Generally, SMAL node alignment clusters contain a
higher number of pairwise homologous or functionally similar pro—
teins than those found by other methods. SMAL MNAs also retain
more interactions and comprise a higher fraction of interologs as
compared to other aligners. Detailed results examining alignment
quality for different choices of the scaffold and a wider set of meas—
ures are included in Supplementary Section S6 and Tables S4 and
S5. The robustness of SMAL to noisy data is analyzed in
Supplementary Section S7 and Fig. S2. Further experimental investi—
gation of SMAL can be found in Dohrmann et al.(2015).

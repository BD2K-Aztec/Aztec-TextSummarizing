pairing was even more signiﬁcant when 7—mer seeds were con—
sidered, with 11.0— and 11.5—fold in enrichment for canonical and
extended seed regions, respectively. When 6—mers from both ca—
nonical and extended seed regions were considered collectively,
seed matches were found in 32.9% of all target sites. Thus, the
majority of the target sites did not have perfect pairing to any
miRNA seed even when both canonical and extended seeds were
considered.

Similar to perfect base pairing, G—U wobble pairs can also
provide thermostability in the RNA duplex. However, a G—U
mismatch in the seed region may potentially interfere with
target binding based on structural analysis (Bartel, 2009). The
impact of G—U mismatch on seed—target binding is still a debat—
able topic, as some studies suggested that the presence of a G—U
mismatch would mostly abolish the miRNA targeting ability,
while some other studies identiﬁed functional target sites with
G—U mismatch to the miRNA seed (Brodersen and Voinnet,
2009; Vella et al., 2004). This issue was revisited using the
CLASH data to analyse any 6—mer seed with a single G—U mis—
match to the target site. As shown in Table 1, there were signiﬁ—
cantly more 6—mers from both canonical and extended seed
regions, with 2.3— and 2.4—fold in enrichment, respectively, for
target pairing with a G—U mismatch as compared with the
shufﬂed control. Thus, our analysis indicated that imperfect
seed pairing with a G—U mismatch to the target site may still

be biologically relevant. However, the enrichment ratios were
much lower than those of perfect seed match, suggesting signifi—
cantly less important role of G—U mismatched seed pairing in
miRNA target recognition. Furthermore, the impact of non—GU
mismatches was also examined. A 7—mer with an internal non—
GU mismatch was only slightly enriched in the target sites (1.3—
and 1.4—fold in enrichment, Table 1), indicating that a non—GU
internal mismatch in seed pairing would mostly abolish miRNA
target recognition. Combined together, 51.1% of all target sites
were paired perfectly to canonical/extended seeds, or imperfectly
with a G—U mismatch.

We further analysed the relevance of non—seed sequence of
miRNA in target recognition. Among all seed—pairing target
sites (9465 in total), 43.5% of them were also paired to non—
seed region of miRNA, which was a signiﬁcant enrichment
over shufﬂed control (Table 2). Furthermore, as to non—canon—
ical target sites without any seed match, 40.9% were paired to the
non—seed region of the miRNA. Thus, pairing to non—seed region
of the miRNA was a signiﬁcant feature for both canonical and
non—canonical targets.

3.2 GC content of miRNA seed was strongly correlated to
target recognition patterns

All 18 514 target sites from the CLASH dataset were analysed to
identify sequence features that characterized perfect seed pairing.

transfected into HeLa cells and changes in protein synthesis due
to miRNA overexpression were determined by proteomic stu—
dies. In our analysis, different miRNA targeting types were eval—
uated with this proteomic dataset. Speciﬁcally, all miRNA—target
pairs from the CLASH dataset were cross—checked with the
proteomic dataset, and 330 common miRNA—target pairs pre—
sented in both datasets were identified. From these identiﬁed
pairs, different miRNA targeting patterns were correlated to
changes in target protein expression due to overexpression of
individual miRNAs. As shown in Figure 5B, canonical targets
with perfect 6—mer seed match were signiﬁcantly suppressed by
miRNA overexpression (mean fold change of —0.114 and
P200004 by comparing with the negative control by
Student’s t—test). In contrast, none of the other miRNA targeting
patterns were signiﬁcantly associated with suppression of target
protein expression (mean fold change ranging from —0.027 to
0.001 and P—values ranging from 0.36 to 0.87 by Student’s t—test).

Multiple experimental strategies have been established to identify
both miRNAs and target transcripts that are bound to the RISC
complex (Chi et al., 2009; Hafner et al., 2010). However, one
major challenge of these strategies is that RNA sequences were
identiﬁed after pooling miRNAs and target transcripts from all
RICS complexes together, which represents a many—to—many re—
lationship for miRNAs and their targets. Thus, information
about specific miRNA—target pairs in each RISC complex was
unknown. Although multiple computational algorithms were
proposed recently for prediction of miRNA—target pairs from
CLIP data (Khorshid et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013; Reczko
et al., 2012), the most straightforward and reliable way would
be to directly identify miRNA—target pairs experimentally. Using
the CLASH method, Helwak et a]. (2013) identiﬁed thousands of
speciﬁc miRNA—target transcript pairs that were bound to the
same RISC complexes. Their work presented an unprecedented
opportunity to study miRNA target recognition patterns, espe—
cially those involving non—canonical target sites.

Most previous miRNA target analyses were focused on target
sites pairing to canonical miRNA seed region. The CLASH data
indicate that many targets are not paired to any canonical
miRNA seed. In fact, canonical miRNA targets represented
only 22% of all targets in the CLASH dataset (Table 1).
However, it was not clear why canonical or non—canonical tar—
gets were preferentially associated with certain miRNAs. A
major novelty of this work is the identification of sequence de—
terminants for miRNA—to—miRNA variability in target recogni—
tion patterns. Speciﬁcally, sequence features related to miRNA
seed composition were identiﬁed that distinguish canonical
miRNA targeting from non—canonical targeting. Our previous
work on a limited number of miRNAs (Nelson et al., 2011)
suggested that there is significant miRNA—to—miRNA variability
associated with target recognition patterns. Interestingly, re—
analysis of the CLASH data containing a large number of
miRNAs revealed that composition of the miRNA seed sequence
was strongly correlated to targeting patterns. For miRNAs with
weak seed binding stability, they recognized target transcripts
mostly through non—canonical mechanisms without involving ca—
nonical seed pairing. Thus, the current work suggested that

variability in seed sequence composition resulted in variable
miRNA—dependent targeting patterns, and this seed variability
issue should be taken into consideration when predicting targets
for individual miRNAs. To this end, we are currently working on
incorporating the seed composition feature into an improved
target prediction algorithm for more accurate prediction of sup—
pression of target gene expression.

Overall, non—canonical targeting was the norm rather than
exception when all miRNAs were considered collectively.
However, the functional consequences of miRNA targeting
were dependent on target recognition patterns. Canonical target—
ing, involving perfect pairing to the canonical seed region, gen—
erally led to significant downregulation of target transcripts. In
contrast, only marginal transcriptional downregulation was
observed for non—canonical types of targets based on microarray
analysis (Fig. 5A). Similarly, canonical targeting, but not any
other targeting type, led to signiﬁcant suppression of target pro—
tein expression based on proteomic analysis (Fig. 5B). Thus, our
target expression analysis agrees with previous observations that
miRNAs typically suppress target expression at both the tran—
scriptional and translational levels (Baek et al., 2008; Guo et al.,
2010; Hendrickson et al., 2009; Selbach et al., 2008). Consistent
with our analysis, previous experimental studies demonstrated
that miRNAs with weak seed binding stability had low proﬁ—
ciency on target downregulation (Didiano and Hobert, 2006;
Garcia et al., 2011), which can be explained by our prediction
that most targets of these miRNAs were of non—canonical type
whose expression was not effectively impacted by miRNA
binding.

The target—type dependency for gene expression regulation
raised an interesting question as to what constitutes an effective
miRNA target. Non—canonical targets were bound by miRNA
and this binding could be functionally important in ways other
than direct target downregulation. For example, non—canonical
targets may serve as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) to
sequester miRNAs from regulating canonical targets (Salmena
et al., 2011). If this is the case, non—canonical targets could
behave more like a reservoir of ‘miRNA regulators’, rather
than targets of miRNA. Thus, it is likely that concurrent inter—
actions between miRNAs and canonical/non—canonical targets
are important to maintain the steady state of gene expression
regulation networks mediated by miRNAs.

Abstract

Motivation: The 14—3—3 family of phosphoprotein—binding proteins regulates many cellular proc—
esses by docking onto pairs of phosphorylated Ser and Thr residues in a constellation of intracellu—
lar targets. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop new prediction methods that use an
updated set of 14—3—3—binding motifs for the identification of new 14—3—3 targets and to prioritize the
downstream analysis of >2000 potential interactors identified in high—throughput experiments.
Results: Here, a comprehensive set of 14—3—3—binding targets from the literature was used to
develop 14—3—3—binding phosphosite predictors. Position—specific scoring matrix, support vector
machines (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) classification methods were trained to discrim—
inate experimentally determined 14—3—3—binding motifs from non—binding phosphopeptides.
ANN, position—specific scoring matrix and SVM methods showed best performance for a motif
window spanning from 76 to +4 around the binding phosphosite, achieving Matthews correlation
coefficient of up to 0.60. Blind prediction showed that all three methods outperform two popular
14—3—3—binding site predictors, Scansite and ELM. The new methods were used for prediction of
14—3—3—binding phosphosites in the human proteome. Experimental analysis of high—scoring predic—
tions in the FAM122A and FAM1228 proteins confirms the predictions and suggests the new 14—3—
3—predictors will be generally useful.

1 Introduction

The 14-3-3 phosphoprotein-hinding proteins interact with many
intracellular targets. Changes in the engagement of l4-3-3s with
different sets of target phosphoproteins cause coordinated shifts in
cellular behaviour in response to growth factors and other stimuli
(Bridges and Moorhead, 2005; Johnson et (11., 2010; 2011;

(C7 The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press.

MacKintosh, 2004). l4-3-3s are boat-shaped dimers that dock onto
specific pairs of phosphorylated Ser and Thr residues (Obsil and
Obsilové, 2011). The phosphosite pairs are often located in tandem
on the same target protein and are typically >15 amino acid residues
apart to allow engagement with both docking sites in the central
groove of the 14-3-3 dimer (Yaffe, 2002; Yaffe et (11., 1997; Zhu
et (11., 2005). The l4-3-3s also have strong preferences with respect

to the sequences immediately flanking the phosphorylated residues
(Yaffe, 2002; Yaffe et al., 1997; Zhu et al., 2005).

Early analyses of known 14—3—3—binding sites indicated
R(S)X1,2(pS)X(P) as a 14—3—3—binding motif (Muslin et al., 1996;
MacKintosh, 2004). Later screening of libraries for phosphopeptides
that displayed optimal binding to 14—3—3s identified two consensus
14—3—3—binding motifs, namely Mode I (RSX(pS/T)XP) and Mode II
(RX(F/Y)X(pS)XP), with subtle preferences and negative determin—
ants for the X residues (Yaffe, 2002; Yaffe et al., 1997; Obsilova
et al., 2008). These sequence motifs served as the basis for a pos—
ition—specific scoring matrix (PSSM) to predict potential 14—3—3—
binding phosphosites in Scansite (Obenauer, 2003). A more recent
survey showed that most experimentally determined 14—3—3—binding
sites (dubbed gold standards) conform to mode I motifs, having at
least one basic residue in the positions —3 to —5, relative to the
phosphoSer/Thr and never a +1 proline. However, the proline at +2
is found in fewer than 50% of cases and often the serine in the —2
position relative to the 14—3—3—binding phosphosite is a residue that
is annotated as phosphorylated (Johnson et al., 2010). Additionally,
Mode III sites, in which the phosphorylated residue is the penulti—
mate residue in the C—terminal tail of a protein target, have also
been reported (Coblitz et al., 2006; Panni et al., 2011).

Recently, a further striking pattern was identified in the human
14—3—3 interactome. The majority of well—defined human 14—3—3—
binding phosphoproteins were discovered to be 2R—ohnologues
(Tinti et al., 2012). This means that they belong to protein families
of two to four members that were generated by the two rounds of
whole—genome duplication (2R—WGD), which marked the evolution—
ary origins of the vertebrate animals ~500 million years ago
(Huminiecki and Heldin, 2010; Makino and McLysaght, 2010).
Most of the new genes were negatively selected and lost. However,
those that were retained in families of two to four members are
highly enriched in signalling proteins that bind to 14—3—3s
(Huminiecki and Heldin, 2010; Tinti et al., 2012). In case studies,
protein families were identified whose members share one 14—3—3
binding site in common (termed the ‘lynchpin’). Lynchpins also align
with a serine or threonine residue in the pro—orthologue proteins
from the pre—2R—WGD invertebrate chordates, Branchiostoma
(amphioxus, lancelet) and Giant; (tunicates, sea squirts). In contrast,
the second sites may differ on different family members and may be
phosphorylated by different protein kinases. These findings led to
the proposal that 14—3—3 dimers may have played a mechanistic role
in the regulatory divergence of 2R—ohnologue families: The lynchpin
hypothesis proposes that conservation of one ‘lynchpin’ 14—3—3—
binding site gave the freedom for the second site to change and
perhaps become a consensus site for phosphorylation by a different
protein kinase (Johnson et al., 2011). The resulting protein families
therefore operate as ‘signal multiplexing” systems that are regulated
by a wider array of protein kinases than would be possible if the
function were performed by only a single protein.

Currently, the Scansite 14—3—3 predictor (Obenauer, 2003) is the
most commonly used software tool to identify potential 14—3—3—
binding phosphosites. Scansite was trained on peptide libraries
derived from a limited number of experimentally defined 14—3—3—
binding sites, but these training datasets no longer accommodate the
diversity of known 14—3—3—binding phosphopeptides. Another source
of information on 14—3—3—binding sites is the ‘eukaryotic linear
motif” database ELM (Puntervoll, 2003). ELM uses regular expres—
sions and context—based filtering to derive pattern probabilities
based on a few dozen Mode I, Mode II and non—consensus motifs.

There are now >2000 phosphoproteins that have been found
to display affinity for 14—3—3 in high—throughput proteomics

experiments (Jin et al., 2004; Nishioka et al., 2012; Pozuelo Rubio
et al., 2004). Accordingly, there is a need to extend predictors to
include 14—3—3 binding sites that do not conform to Mode I binding
and to test the signal multiplexing hypothesis. A more comprehen—
sive picture of potential 14—3—3 binding sites would help to define
how the complete 14—3—3—interactome system works. The ANIA
(ANnotation and Integrated Analysis of the 14—3—3 interactome)
web service and database (Tinti et al., 2014) integrates multiple
datasets on 14—3—3—binding phosphoproteins and provides an up—
to—date gold—standard dataset of experimentally determined 14—3—3—
binding phosphosites of all known Modes. In this article, three new
classifiers of 14—3—3—binding sites are described that have been
trained on the ANIA gold—standard dataset. The new predictors
are compared with Scansite and ELM, predictions for the human
phosphoproteome performed and a couple of high—scoring sites
experimentally tested.

2 Methods

2.1 Data collection and preprocessing

The human proteome was retrieved from the UniProt database
(June 2013 release) and all Ser/T hr residues located in every protein
sequence. A collection of annotated phosphoSer/Thr sites (phospho—
proteome) was gathered from PhosphoSitePlus (October 2013
release) (Hornbeck et al., 2004).

A list of 300 experimentally determined 14—3—3—binding phos—
phosites was collected from ANIA (Tinti et al., 2014) and further
extended from the literature to give 322 gold—standard 14—3—3—
binding sites (POS) (Supplementary Table S1). A negative dataset
(NEG) (Supplementary Table S2) was assembled from the literature
cited in Johnson et a]. (2010), resulting in 93 phosphosites. To pre—
pare balanced sets of POS and NEG examples, 230 additional likely
non—binding sites were randomly selected from a subset of proteins
for which two 14—3—3—binding sites had been experimentally defined.
Although the likely NEG sites are located in 14—3—3—binding pro—
teins, these sites are thought unlikely to bind 14—3—3s since there is
currently no evidence of proteins that bind 14—3—3 through multiple
pairs of phosphosites. The resulting POS and NEG datasets com—
prised balanced numbers of phosphopeptides that were further
processed for training of the classifiers.

To explore motif patterns that are in agreement with the modes
of binding previously proposed, five non—symmetrical motif win—
dows around the phosphoSer/T hr site were defined, including
[—3:1], [—4:2], [—5:3], [—6:4] and [—7:5]. These motif windows
ranged from 4 to 12 residues in width not including the central
phosphoSer/Thr residue. The peptides in the POS and NEG datasets
were also filtered for sequence redundancy at a range of identity
thresholds for all pairwise peptide comparisons. When working
with small peptides, a single amino acid difference can be critical for
determining specificity. Thus, determining redundancy in short pep—
tides is not straightforward. In this article, redundancy is defined by
differences of 1 . . .k/2 amino acids, where k is length of the peptide.
Thus, redundancy thresholds ranged from a minimum of one residue
difference up to half of the size of the motif window (equivalent to
50% redundancy level). For example, for motif window [—6:4] that
comprises 10 residues, five levels of redundancy were investigated
with a minimum number of differences ranging from one to five.
Since the number of redundancy thresholds investigated depends
on the size of the motif window in analysis, all combinations of win—
dows and redundancy thresholds were tested in model training
and testing.

To reduce the risk of bias, the resulting pairs of balanced POS
and NEG datasets from different combinations of motif windows
and redundancy thresholds were further split into two independent
training and testing subsets. This gave 240 (75%) and 78 (25%)
peptides for training and testing, respectively. After selecting the
best overall models in training and testing, final methods were
trained using the full non—redundant training and testing subsets,
comprising 318 POS and 318 NEG peptide examples in total
(100%) (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). An additional independ—
ent and ‘blind’ test dataset (BLIND) comprising 38 experimentally
defined 14—3—3—binding sites was collected from the literature
(Supplementary Table S3). Following the same strategy used for pre—
paring the training datasets, 32 likely non—binding phosphosites
were selected as BLIND negatives (Supplementary Table S4).

2.2 Classification methods

2.2.1 Artificial neural network

Artificial neural network (ANN) models were trained using the R
package RSNNS (Bergmeir and Benitez, 2012) and the Stuttgart
Neural Network Simulator (SNNS; http://www.ra.cs.uni—tuebingen.
de/SNNS). For ANN training, each of the 20 different amino acids
was encoded as a binary vector of length 20. For example, Ala was
encoded as [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], whereas Arg
was encoded as [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. This
pattern was followed for all 20 amino acids, whereas gaps or other
ambiguous amino acids were encoded as [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Accordingly, phosphopeptides of length k
(4 S k S 12) were encoded by vectors of length 20k. The final ANN
model had 20 input nodes, a single hidden layer with 20 nodes
and one output layer with one output node. Training was per—
formed by the backpropagation algorithm with momentum term
(‘Backpropmomentum’), learning parameter 11 : 0.2 and momentum
term u : 0.05.

2.2.2 Position-specific scoring matrix

PSSMs were implemented in Python (http://www.python.org) and
assembled by adapting the procedure described by Ferrari et al.
(2011). Amino acid frequency matrices were derived from POS and
NEG datasets and from a background (B GD) dataset, made up of
all peptides that have annotated phosphoSer/T hr sites (phosphopro—
teome). For each motif window of length k of the alignment
(4 g k g 12), a PSSM was assembled with 21 rows [20 amino acids
plus gaps or ambiguous (X), AA : (A, R, N, D, C, Q, E, G, H, I, L,
K, M, F, P, S, T, W, Y, V, X)] and k columns, where the values rep—
resent the frequency of amino acid 1' {i 6 AA} at the jth position
{/2 1 . . . k} in the multiple alignment of all peptides. Equation (1)
defines the final score S(p) assigned to each queried phosphopeptide
p, which is calculated by adding up the scores for all the positions,
where

k
POSL' — NEGL'
S<P> =  ‘1)
, .

POSU, NEGL, and BGDL, are the frequency values for amino acid 1'
at position i, in the POS, NEG and BGD matrices, respectively.

2.2.3 Support vector machines

Support vector machine (SVM) models were trained and parameter—
ized using the Python module PyML (http://pyml.sourceforge.net),
which contains a set of non—linear kernels specifically developed
for training and classification of biological sequences (Ben—Hur

et al., 2008). The final SVM model employed the weighed—degree
kernel (Sonnenburg et al., 2005), with soft margin constant C,
which specifies the degree of separation between the two training
classes of support vectors in the hyperplane was set to one. Lastly,
the cosine kernel was applied to normalize the kernel values.

2.3 Feature selection for the ANN models

Two independent alphabet reduction systems were tried. Both meth—
ods grouped the 20 amino acids in 10 classes according their physi—
cochemical properties and were encoded as an orthogonal 10—length
binary (Li et al., 2003; Livingstone and Barton, 1993).

Further features were also explored as inputs to the ANN model.
Protein secondary structure predictions and solvent accessibility
were computed by Jpred (Cole et al., 2008), which provides predic—
tions of oc—helix, ﬁ—strand, random coil and solvent accessible or
buried. In addition to the 20—length binary vector of amino acid
encodings, every residue position including the central Ser/Thr was
encoded as a 5—length binary vector or alternatively encoded as a
vector of raw Jpred prediction scores [0.0:1.0], resulting in a vector
of length 20k + 5 (k + 1). Similarly, three methods for predicting na—
tively unstructured/disordered regions in proteins (Dosztanyi et al.,
2005; Linding, 2003; Linding et al., 2003) were computed using the
JABAWS package (Troshin et al., 2011). Peptide motifs were classi—
fied as disordered or structured by four methods and were encoded
as a binary vector of length 2, which resulted in an encoding vector
of length 20k + 2(4). IUPred prediction scores 20.5 were used to de—
fine disordered regions, whereas for GlobPlot, the Dydx algorithm
with a threshold of 20.0 was used. Regions predicted by both
DisEMBL algorithms: HOTLOOPS and REM465 were considered
for disorder classification.

2.4 Evaluation methods

The performance of each classifier was evaluated by Jackknife
(leave—one—out cross—validation) on the training and testing data, be—
fore a final test on the BLIND dataset. The performance of each
method was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curves, which were plotted at various thresholds (Fawcett, 2004).
The area under the ROC curve (AUC) (Sonego et al., 2008) was
used as the primary performance measure. Additional standard
metrics were calculated for each method including sensitivity (SN,
equivalent to recall) (Equation 1), specificity (SP) (Equation 2),
positive predictive value (PPV, equivalent to precision) (Equation 3),
accuracy (ACC) (Equation 4) and Matthews correlation coefficient
(MCC) (Equation 5), where TP, FP, TN, FN denote the number
of true positives, false positives, true negatives and false negatives,

respectively.

3The results shown were calculated based on optimal thresholds derived from accuracy/cut-off plots for the ﬁnal models. The cut-Offs are 0.55, 0.80, 0.25 and

0.50, for ANN, PSSM, SVN and Consensus, respectively.

l’The consensus predictor averages the scores obtained by the three methods: ANN, PSSM and SVM.
CScansite PSSM prediction scores were obtained by querying Netphorest. An optimal cut-off of 0.15 resulted in the balanced performance observed for

Scansite2 low.
dBased on categorical classiﬁcation of the queried phosphoproteins.

’“The signiﬁcance level of each method’s MCC score was assessed against the MCC score of the consensus predictor by computing a distribution of MCC scores

for 100 bootstrap replicates with replacement, randomly selecting examples from the BLIND dataset. Underlined MCC scores indicate that the method is signiﬁ-

cantly worse than the consensus predictor (P < 0.05), whereas double underline indicates high signiﬁcance (P < 0.001 ).

Since phosphorylated Ser/Thr usually lie at the protein surfaces
enabling kinase/phosphatase activity, as well as regulation by the 14—
3—3s (Vandermarliere and Martens, 2013), additional features such as
secondary structure, solvent accessibility, and protein disorder were
tested to see their effect on performance, as was feature—selection by
amino acid alphabet reduction. Although these approaches have
proved useful in a number of classification tasks (e.g. Aytuna et al.,
2005; McDowall et al., 2009), here they added complexity but did
not give a significant improvement in the performance of the methods
developed here (data not shown).

3.2 Comparison with other predictors

The performance of the new classification methods developed here
was compared with Scansite (Obenauer, 2003) and ELM
(Puntervoll, 2003), using an additional dataset (the BLIND set) that
was not used for training the methods. The BLIND dataset com—
prises 38 experimentally defined 14—3—3—binding phosphopeptides
and 32 non—14—3—3—binding sites. Raw Scansite prediction scores
were obtained by querying Netphorest (Miller et al., 2008) that fully
implements the original Scansite PSSM. Categorical classification
scores were also obtained for each BLIND phosphoprotein, from
the Scansite2 (Obenauer, 2003), Scansite3 (unpublished work by
T.Ehrenberger, 2012) and ELM web servers (Dinkel et al., 2013).
Scansite2 provides prediction scores based on 14—3—3 Mode I motifs
that fall into three stringency levels: high, medium and low.
Scansite3, a Java implementation of Scansite2, enables search for
a fourth stringency level: minimum. ELM uses context—based filter—
ing and text mining to improve the accuracy of assigned pattern—
matching probabilities based on Mode I and Mode II 14—3—3—binding
as well as non—consensus 14—3—3—binding. Overall, any phosphoSer/
Thr site for which a prediction score was provided (at a particular
stringency level, in the case of Scansite) was considered to be classi—
fied as 14—3—3—binding. All the remaining sites were classified as
non—14—3—3—binding. Although other methods exist to predict 14—3—3
binding sites (Chan et al., 2011; Panni et al., 2011), no software

or pre—computed predictions were available for comparison to the
methods developed here.

As listed in Table 1, all three methods developed here
showed higher MCC scores (up to 0.60 for ANN and PSSM),
when compared Netphorest Scansite, Scansite2 and Scansite3 at
different stringency levels and ELM (up to 0.52 for Scansite2 low
and ELM). Indeed, the new methods present the best accuracy
(ACC of 80.0% for the ANN and 78.6% for PSSM and SVM),
compared with accuracies of the other predictors, which are gener—
ally lower than 75.7% (obtained for Scansite2 low). The perform—
ance scores of the new methods agree with the performance
observed in model training and testing (Fig. 1). However, the PPV
observed for the BLIND dataset is higher (from 79.8% for the
final models compared with 285.3% PPV for the BLIND dataset),
which might be an outcome of the unbalanced composition of the
BLIND dataset. A consensus predictor achieved 0.61 MCC and
80.0% ACC by averaging the scores from the three methods. Both
Scansite2 and Scansite3 big/a stringency showed 100% PPV and
100% specificity (SP). This results from the fact that both methods
incorrectly classify most sites as non—14—3—3 binding and give small
numbers of TP and FP (zero FP in this particular case) but high FN.
In terms of sensitivity (SN), the best method was Scansite3 min-
imum with 84.2% SN, compared with the ANN that showed
76.3% SN. Here, Scansite3 minimum correctly predicted 32 out of
38 POS examples, whereas the ANN correctly predicted 29/38.
Although Scansite predictors show higher SN and SP, the new pre—
dictors show a better balance between these two metrics, which
leads to superior ACC and MCC scores.

Two—sample sequence analysis of the final POS and NEG data—
sets revealed that Mode I is indeed the most common, accounting
for ~46% enrichment of Arg at position —3 and ~31% enrichment
of Pro at +2 position. Additionally, poorer enrichment of Ser and
Leu at positions —2 and +1, respectively, as well as depletion of Pro
at +1, is also observed. A similar profile is observed for the BLIND
dataset, which might explain why Scansite low and minimum

Proteins that have shown afﬁnity to 14-3-3 in high-throughput experiments and 2R-ohnologue members were identiﬁed by querying ANIA. FAM122A and

FAM122B were experimentally veriﬁed to bind 14-3-3 in this study.

“The consensus predictor averages the scores obtained by the three methods: ANN, PSSM and SVM.

correctly classifies POS examples equally well as the consensus pre—
dictor. However, non—consensus binding motifs are better covered
by the methods introduced here since the consensus motifs I and II
represent less than 30% of POS in both training and blind datasets.
The correlation between the consensus predictor and Netphorest
Scansite scores, for prediction of 14—3—3—binding phosphopeptides
in the human proteome (Section 3.3), is only 7: 0.65 (P< 0.001),
indicating that a fair number of peptides produce discordant predic—
tions by Scansite and the methods developed here.

Overall, based on the performance measures and benchmark re—
sults listed in Table 1 and Figure 1C, all methods introduced in this
study outperform the previous predictors with Scansite2 low and
ELM the closest rivals. The consensus predictor is significantly bet—
ter than all the Scansite predictors and ELM, based on the MCC
scores obtained for the BLIND dataset (P < 0.05). As the exact pep—
tide datasets used for training Scansite are not known, it is likely
that the real performance of Scansite will be lower, as some of the
tested examples could have been used for its training. Similarly,
ELM adds literature annotation for known 14—3—3—binding phospho—
sites when available, so its prediction performance is perhaps over
optimistic. In fact, ~60% (15/24) TP were annotated from the lit—
erature, making this benchmark evaluation moderately biased in
favour of ELM. Intriguingly, Scansite2 and Scansite3 presented
some classification differences at high and low stringency levels.
Whether this difference is the result of the new implementation of
Scansite3, potentially setting new underlying stringency thresholds,
or due to the addition of a minimum stringency level is not clear.

3.3 Prediction and experimental testing of 14—3—3—
binding phosphosites in the human proteome

All 1 543 965 Ser/Thr residues in the 20 245 proteins of the human
proteome as released in June 2013 were considered as potential
14—3—3 sites and ranked according to the methods developed here.

The consensus classifier predicted a total of 75 891 potential binding
sites in 17214 proteins. This corresponds to 4.9% of all Ser/Thr
sites with an average of four sites per protein. Considering only the
set of 117 640 proteins for which phosphoSer/Thr sites have already
been annotated, the number of predicted sites falls to 10 881 in
5483 proteins. This corresponds to 9.2% of all Ser/Thr sites in the
phosphoproteome and an average of two candidate phosphosites
per protein, which reduces the potential number of FP, since pro—
teins known to be phosphorylated potentially bind to 14—3—3 dimers.
This approach makes it more amenable for prioritizing experimental
investigation. As shown below, two high—ranking ANN predictions
were further tested by experiment.

Table 2 lists the top 20 high—scoring candidates” sites predicted
by the three methods on the phosphoproteome. Predicted proteins
include sperm—specific antigen 2 (3rd); sorbin and SH3 domain—
containing protein 1 (5th); negative elongation factor E (6th); E3
ubiquitin—protein ligase HUWE1 (17th); E3 ubiquitin—protein ligase
UBR4 (18th) and Centrosomal protein of 170 kDa (19th): all of
which had been previously detected in 14—3—3—binding capture
experiments (Tinti et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2011) but whose 14—3—
3—binding sites remained elusive. High—scoring predictions by the
consensus predictor support that these proteins partner with 14—3—
3s; however, further experiments have to be performed to validate
these candidate binding sites.

Two of the predicted sites, ranked at 2nd and 11th with consen—
sus scores of 1.88 and 1.67, are for family with sequence similarity
122A and 122B (FAM122A and FAM122B). FAM122 is a family
of three uncharacterized proteins (A, B and C). FAM122A and
FAM122B is a pair of 2R—ohnologues, whereas FAM122C evolved
by tandem duplication of FAM122B in mammals (adjacent genes
at Xq26.3). Such tandem duplication of 2R—ohnologues is rare
(Makino and McLysaght, 2010).

Consistent with the 14—3—3—Pred results (Table 2), all three
FAM122 family members displayed phosphorylation—dependent

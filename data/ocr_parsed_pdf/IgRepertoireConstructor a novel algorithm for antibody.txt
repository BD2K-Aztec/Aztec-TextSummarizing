Abstract

The analysis of concentrations of circulating antibodies in serum (antibody repertoire) is a
fundamental, yet poorly studied, problem in immunoinformatics. The two current approaches to
the analysis of antibody repertoires [next generation sequencing (NGS) and mass spectrometry
(M8)] present difficult computational challenges since antibodies are not directly encoded in the
germline but are extensively diversified by somatic recombination and hypermutations. Therefore,
the protein database required for the interpretation of spectra from circulating antibodies is custom
for each individual. Although such a database can be constructed via NGS, the reads generated by
NGS are error—prone and even a single nucleotide error precludes identification of a peptide by the
standard proteomics tools. Here, we present the iGREPERTOIRECONSTRUCTOR algorithm that performs
error—correction of immunosequencing reads and uses mass spectra to validate the constructed
antibody repertoires.

Availability and implementation: iGREPERTOIRECONSTRUCTOR is open source and freely available as a
C++ and Python program running on all Unix—compatible platforms. The source code is available

1 Introduction

Until 2009, the computational analysis of antibodies had been per—
formed Via proteomics techniques (Bandeira et (11., 2008) and had
not utilized DNA sequencing technologies. Weinstein et al. (2009)
were the first to demonstrate the power of DNA sequencing for ana—
lyzing antibody repertoires and to open a ‘neXt generation sequenc—
ing (NGS) era’ in antibody analysis (Fig. 1a). Although this study
was quickly followed by many other immunosequencing (lg—seq)
studies (Arnaout et (11., 2011; Jiang et (11., 2011, 2013; Laserson
et al. 2014; Vollmers et (11., 2013); until 2012, there were no at—
tempts to integrate NGS and mass spectrometry (MS) approaches
for antibody analysis. Such integration (immunoproteogenomics) is

important since it represents a bottleneck for an emerging approach
that promises to transform the antibody industry from focusing on
single (monoclonal) antibodies, toward analyzing polyclonal
antibodies.

Cheung et al. (2012) pioneered a new immunoproteogenomics
approach for identification of circulating monoclonal antibodies
from serum that enables high—throughput antibody development.
Although sequencing purified monoclonal antibodies has now be—
come routine (Bandeira et (11., 2008; Castellana et (11., 2011; Liu
et (11., 2009), sequencing multiple antibodies from a complex sample
represents a breakthrough with great biomedical potential. The im—
portant conclusion in Cheung et al. (2012) is that antibody analysis

Fig. 1. (a) An overview of immunoglobulin (lg-seq) sequencing. Briefly, B-cells are isolated; transcripts are purified; antibody chains are amplified by PCR; and fi-

nally, paired-end sequencing of the lg variable region is performed on the amplified lg transcript molecules. (b) An antibody repertoire containing five different

antibodies (shown on the left) is characterized by a set of pairs <sequence, abundance > (shown on the right). For example, the abundance of the ‘red' antibody

is 3. (c) The varying levels of sequence information. First, the paired reads are stitched together to form contiguous reads. These reads are then compressed to

unique reads with count information, and finally clustered reads. E.g. the red and blue unique reads (with counts 3 and 1) are clustered into a single cluster with

count 4 because they represent reads (with errors) derived from the same antibody. (d) Reads are partitioned according to identical CDR3 sequences (shown in

the black rectangles). Each resulting cluster of antibodies is referred to as a clone

should combine NGS and MS to infer antibodies interacting with a
specific antigen (see also Georgiou et al., 2014; Lavinder et al.,
2014; Sato et al., 2012; Wine et al., 2013; Yadav et al., 2014). In
particular, Cheung et al. (2012) showed that the most well repre—
sented transcripts in the antibody repertoire (revealed by NGS
alone) may not be the most biomedically relevant. Thus, immuno—
proteogenomics is the key ingredient of the emerging new technol—
ogy for antibody analysis. However, no publicly available
immunoproteogenomics software is currently available.

An antibody repertoire (rather than a set of all DNA reads as in
previous immunoproteogenomics studies) represents a sensible
choice of a database for the follow up MS/MS searches. However,
construction of an antibody repertoire is a difficult problem since
antibody genes in antigen stimulated B—lymphocytes are not directly
encoded in the germline but are diversified by somatic recombin—
ation and mutations (Wine et al. 2013). Therefore, the protein data—
base required for the interpretation of mass spectra from circulating
antibodies differs between individuals. Moreover, even a single error
in an error—prone NGS read precludes identification of a peptide
(spanning the erroneous position) by the standard proteomics tools.

We emphasize that construction of antibody repertoires is a dif—
ferent problem than the well studied VD] classiﬁcation (Brochet
et al., 2008; Gaéta et al., 2007; Volpe et al., 2006) and CDR3 classi-
ﬁcation (Freeman et al., 2009; Robins et al., 2009, 2010; Warren
et al., 2011) problems. In fact, VD] classification, CDR3 classifica—
tion and repertoire construction are three different clustering prob—
lems with increasing granularity of partitions into clusters and
different biological applications:

' VD] classiﬁcation refers to classifying reads into 225 X 30 X 13
clusters (since human genome has 225V, 30 D and 13] func—
tional and complete antibody gene—segments). There is currently

a multitude of VD] classiﬁcation tools, e.g. Bonissone and
Pevzner (2015) report 94.5, 99.1 and 99.4% accuracy for V, D
and] gene segments, respectively.

' CDR3 classiﬁcation is a more granular clustering that refers to
classifying reads according to their CDR3 region, the most bio—
logically important segment of an antibody.

' Full length antibody repertoire classiﬁcation is the most granular
clustering of antibodies that extends the above two clustering
approaches by accounting for somatic hypermutations (SHMs).
It is arguably the most biologically relevant clustering and a pre—
requisite for the future studies of antibody evolution.

The antibody repertoire can potentially subpartition each VD]
class/CDR3 class into thousands of subclusters based on the identity
of CDR regions and hypermutations. Because various antibodies
often share similar segments, the computational challenge of anti—
body clustering is not unlike the computational challenge of classify—
ing repeats in a genome. From this perspective, the VD]
classification corresponds to distinguishing between different fami-
lies of repeats (e.g. between Alu and MIR repeats in the human gen—
ome), while constructing antibody repertoires corresponds to a very
different algorithmic problem of classifying different subfamilies
within the same repeat family, e.g. distinguishing between Alu] and
AluY repeat subfamilies (Price et al., 2004) on the challenge of the
repeat subfamily classification).

Until recently, there were no attempts to cluster full length anti—
bodies since it was nearly impossible to derive an accurate antibody
repertoire with previous experimental approaches based on error—
prone and low coverage 454 sequencing technology. MiGEC
(Shugay et al., 2014) is the only tool for the full length repertoire
analysis that, however, is not applicable to standard Ig—seq protocols
since it requires a special barcode—based sample preparation.

Below we summarize the new contributions of this work to
immunoproteogenomics:

' The crucial distinction between the previous Ig—seq studies
(Cheung et al., 2012; Sato et al., 2012; Wine et al., 2013) and
the one presented [with a notable exception of Greiff et al.
(2014)], is the number of reads. Our Ig—seq runs capture $3.8
million reads, compared with the thousands of reads obtained
with 454 sequencing technology that dominated Ig—seq prior to
2014. This allows for greater depth in characterizing the reper—
toire and immunoproteogenomics analysis, but comes with its
own set of computational challenges.

' Although Ig—seq studies have been rapidly developing in the last
5 years, the error—correction techniques from genome sequencing
(Pevzner et al., 2001) have not been applied to Ig—seq yet and the
previous immunoproteogenomics studies have not attempted to
construct antibody repertoires for the follow up MS/MS
searches. Some other studies did perform a simple variant of
error correction in the context of VD] labeling (]iang et al.,
2011; Reddy et al., 2010; Weinstein et al., 2009). However, since
these studies addressed a relatively simple task of VD] classiﬁca—
tion rather than repertoire construction, they have limited ability
to correct errors in the most important CDR regions that do not
contribute to VD] classiﬁcation. IGREPERTOIRECONSTRUCTOR is the
ﬁrst tool for generating antibody repertoires from standard
Ig—seq protocols.

' In addition to the problem of constructing an antibody reper—
toire, there is also a challenge of validating this repertoire.
Indeed, since there is no gold standard that represents a curated
and veriﬁed antibody repertoire, it is not clear how to validate
the accuracy of the constructed repertoires (on real rather than
simulated data). We show that immunoproteogenomics allows
one to resolve this Catch—22 and to evaluate the accuracy of the
antibody repertoire (due to the complementary nature of errors
in DNA reads and in peptides identiﬁed by MS).

' Immunoproteogenomics analysis of circulating antibodies re—
quires searches of all spectra against a highly repetitive database
derived from millions of Ig—seq reads. Cheung et al. (2012) found
surprisingly few Peptide—Spectrum Matches (PSMs) from spectra
they analyzed suggesting that many spectra evaded the identiﬁca—
tion either due to errors in NGS reads or due to statistical arti—
facts of searches in a highly repetitive database. Recently, Boutz
et al. (2014) discussed the challenge of peptide identiﬁcation in
large highly repetitive database of antibodies that is further
ampliﬁed by the limitations of the target—decoy approach (Gupta
et al., 2011). We argue that construction of the antibody reper—
toire enables a new multi—layer approach to immunoproteoge—
nomics searches (each layer corresponds to antibodies with
abundances falling into speciﬁc intervals) that signiﬁcantly
boosts the number of identiﬁed PSMs [z 22% of spectra are
identiﬁed at 1% false discovery rate (FDR) as compared with
z 6% at 2% FDR identiﬁed in Cheung et al. (2012)].

' Cheung et al. (2012) raised a concern about the lack of correl—
ation between genomics—based and proteomics—based quantiﬁca—
tion of antibodies (that far exceeds the commonly observed
limited correlation in traditional proteogenomics studies
(Nesvizhskii, 2014). However, since previous immunoproteoge—
nomics studies were based on low—coverage 454 technology, it
was not clear whether this lack of correlation represents sam—
pling artifacts or reﬂects the fact that previous immunoproteoge—
nomics studies did not correct sequencing errors. Our analysis of
Illumina datasets (orders of magnitude increase in coverage as

compared with previous immunoproteogenomics studies) re—
vealed an even more alarming lack of correlation between two
approaches to quantiﬁcation: more than half of identiﬁed pep—
tides come from antibodies that are represented by a single read
in the antibody repertoire! However, we show that switching
from quantiﬁcation of individual antibodies, to quantiﬁcation of
antibody clones, partially restores correlation between genomics—
based and proteomics—based quantiﬁcation.

2 Methods
2.1 Antibody repertoires

If we view an antibody as a center of a cluster formed by reads
derived from this antibody, then construction of a repertoire corres—
ponds to a difficult clustering problem with many closely located
centers so that the radius of a cluster may exceed the distance from
one cluster to another one. Because the standard clustering tech—
niques (like k—means clustering) are not applicable to such problems
(Price et al., 2004), we have designed IGREPERTOIRECONSTRUCTOR, a
novel algorithm for constructing antibody repertoires.

Each antibody in an antibody repertoire is characterized by its
sequence and abundance; estimated by the number of reads derived
from this antibody (Fig. 1b). The complexity of the antibody reper—
toire mirrors the complexity of the immune system, e.g. clonal selec—
tion leads to a highly uneven distribution of abundances of
antibodies (Burnet, 1976). Abundant antibodies mutate and yield
new antibodies that share the same VD] recombination pattern, but
differ only by SHMs. As a result, the antibody repertoire contains a
mixture of closely related antibodies with differing abundances. The
abundances of z 2.3 million antibodies in our dataset vary from 1
to z 33, 000 with the most abundant antibody representing z 1%
of all reads (all examples below refer to the heavy chain Ig—seq data—
set described in the ‘Section 3.1’).

The major challenge in constructing antibody repertoires is the
identification of all reads that are derived from a single antibody.
If reads were error—free, we would simply group together reads that
are identical (up to small shifts) into unique reads to generate an anti—
body repertoire. In reality, reads are error—prone necessitating error-
correction of reads prior to any analysis. IGREPERTOIRECONSTRUCTOR
error—corrects reads; partitions them into clusters; and computes the
consensus sequence and abundance of each antibody. Figure 1c
depicts the different levels of clustering performed by
IGREPERTOIRECONST’RUCTOR. First, we computationally stitch paired—
end reads of Ig molecules to derive the contiguous Ig—seq reads.
Subsequently, the Ig—seq reads are grouped together to provide
unique I g—seq reads. Finally, the unique reads are clustered to obtain
clustered Ig—seq reads (antibodies). In addition, we can represent
antibodies according to the somatically recombined B—cell from
which they originate, i.e. their clonality. We define an antibody
clone as the set of all antibodies in the repertoire with the
same CDR3 sequence [as determined by IgBlast (Ye et al., 2013)].
Figure 1d diagrams this clone identification process. A clone is triv—
ial if it consists of a single cluster and non—trivial otherwise. The
sharp distribution of clone sizes (Supplementary Fig. A1) can be
attributed to B—cell response to an antigen, i.e. clonal selection
(Weinstein et al., 2009).

2.2 Limitations of existing error correction tools

At first glance, it appears that the problem of error—correction in
Ig—seq is not unlike the problem of error—correction in genome as—
sembly (Pevzner et al., 2001). However, popular error—correction

tools, e.g. Quake (Kelley et al., 2010) or BayesHammer (Nikolenko
et al., 2013), that were optimized for genome assembly, are not
suited for Ig—seq data. Indeed, Ig—seq data contain a large number of
sequences differing by very few mismatches or indels, and feature
the extremely uneven coverage of various antibodies by reads (since
abundances of antibodies differ by orders of magnitudes). Both
Quake and BayesHammer start by identifying solid k—mers in reads
(that are likely to be present in the genome) and use them to correct
reads. However, to find solid k—mers, Quake uses the read coverage,
an approach that is not applicable in the case of Ig—seq with highly
variable abundances. In contrast, BayesHammer (part of the SPAdes
assembler, Bankevich et al., 2012) was designed to assemble single
cell sequencing data with uneven coverage. However, it is also not
applicable to Ig—seq since an antibody repertoire yields numerous
similar, correct, k—mers from different antibodies (Supplementary
Fig. A2). BayesHammer is unable to distinguish these correct k—mers
from similar incorrect k—mers derived from the same antibody.

2.3 Hamming graph for analyzing lg—seq data

IGREPERTOIRECONSTRUCTOR uses the idea of the Hamming graph for
error correction (Medvedev et al., 2011; Nikolenko et al. 2013) to
correct Illumina reads. With the emergence of longer (25 0 nt)
Illumina reads in 2013 (until 2013, Illumina technology generated
shorter reads that did not fully cover the variable region of antibod—
ies), it is now possible to interrogate repertoires using accurate high—
throughput Illumina technology. The Hamming distance d(s1,sz)
between sequences 51 and $2 of equal length is defined as the number
of positions where the symbol in $1 differs from a symbol in 52
(Supplementary Fig. A3a). We extend the concept of Hamming dis—
tance to any two sequences (including sequences with different
lengths) by considering all sufficiently long overlaps between
sequences 51 and 52 (longer than the default value 5), and
computing the Hamming distance between the overlapping parts.
We define d(s1,sz) as the minimum of such distances
(Supplementary Fig. A3b). We define the Hamming Graph
H G(Strings) as the complete weighted graph whose vertices corres—
pond to a collection of sequences Strings and the weight of the edge
(51, $2) is equal to d(51 , $2). The Bounded Hamming Graph, denoted
HG(Strings,r), is a subgraph of the Hamming Graph where edge
(51, $2) exists iff d(s1,sz) S r. The time— and space—efficient construc—
tion of large Hamming Graphs is a challenging problem that was ad—
dressed in Nikolenko et al. (2013) and adapted in
IGREPERTOIRECONSTRUCTOR. Note that compared with Hammer

(Medvedev et al., 2011) and BayesHammer (Nikolenko et al.,
2013), we construct the Bounded Hamming Graph on the entire
reads (rather than on k—mers) and use the generalized Hamming
distance.

2.4 Repertoire construction and search for dense

subg raphs

We construct an antibody repertoire by partitioning reads into clus—
ters that correspond to the same antibody. Our goal is to place reads
differing by sequencing errors into the same cluster, while placing
reads corresponding to different antibodies into different clusters.
This becomes difficult since the number of errors in a read from a
given cluster may be larger than the number of differences between
antibodies from different clusters. We define the antibody sequence
as the consensus of reads in a cluster, and its abundance as the num—
ber of reads in a cluster.

Because Illumina reads have a small indel rate, the generalized
Hamming distance between reads from the same cluster should be
low. We thus construct the Bounded Hamming Graph H G(Reads, r)
from all reads. Our analysis revealed that the generalized Hamming
distance for most Ig—seq reads, originating from the same antibody,
does not exceed 3 and that many antibodies form complete, or
nearly complete, subgraphs of the Bounded Hamming Graph with
r : 3 (Appendix A). Ideally, we would like to choose 17 in such a way
that HG(Reads,r) is a clique graph, i.e. a graph where each con—
nected component is a complete subgraph (clique).

In reality, the large connected components of the Bounded
Hamming Graph often have a more complex structure. Given a con—
nected component with m edges and n vertices, we define its edge
fill-in as the ratio of the number its edges (m) to the maximal pos—
sible number of edges in the graph on n vertices [n- (n — 1) /2].
Figure 2a presents a connected component of the Bounded
Hamming graph with edge fill—in 0.25 (17:3). The lion’s share of
large connected components in the Bounded Hamming Graph (i.e.
components with more than 100 vertices) have similar structures
characterized by small edge fill—ins; the average edge fill—in for large
components is 0.32 (Supplementary Fig. A4). Additional analysis of
the connected components reveals that the nearly all of them
(98.6%) consist of dense (complete or nearly complete) subgraphs
connected by very few edges. Most vertices in these dense subgraphs
correspond to error—prone reads derived from a single antibody or
from highly similar antibodies differing from each other by a small
number of SHMs.

all ‘yellow' reads are similar to each other and all ‘blue' reads are similar to each other (the differences are highlighted in red and likely represent sequencing
errors). However, there exists a systematic difference (C/G mismatch within RGYW pattern in CDR1 region) between ‘yellow' and ‘blue’ reads that allows

lGREPERTOIRECONSTRUCTOR to split the large yellow subgraph in top right subfigure

Thus, the first step in constructing an antibody repertoire is solv—
ing a very large instance of the Corrupted Cliques Problem: finding
the smallest number of additions and removals of edges that trans—
form the Bounded Hamming Graph into a clique graph. Although
there exist a number of algorithms for solving the Corrupted Cliques
Problem (such as CAST; Ben—Dor et al., 1999), they are too slow for
the Bounded Hamming Graphs with many vertices. We thus de—
veloped a different approach for analyzing the Bounded Hamming
Graph that is based on transforming it into a triangulated graph (i.e.
a graph where every cycle of length longer than three has a chord)
rather than a clique graph using the Minimum Fill—in Problem
(Garey and ]ohnson, 1979).

2.5 Repertoire construction and minimum fill—in
problem

The minimum fill-in edge-set for a graph is the edge—set of minimal
size whose addition turns this graph into a triangulated graph. We
are interested in triangulated graphs because maximal cliques in
these graphs can be generated in polynomial time (Galinier et al.,
1995) and because maximal cliques in the triangulated Bounded
Hamming Graph help to reveal dense subgraphs of the original
Bounded Hamming Graph (Appendix B for details).

Although the Minimum Fill—in Problem is NP—complete
(Yannakakis, 1981), there exist efficient approximation algorithms
for solving it, e.g. METIS algorithm (Karypis and Kumar, 1999).
The METIS algorithm is based on the equivalence between triangu—
lated graphs and perfect elimination orderings. A perfect elimination
ordering in a graph is such an ordering of its vertices that, for each
vertex v, v and the vertices following it in the order, form a clique
(Supplementary Fig. A11d). A graph is triangulated if and only if it

has a perfect elimination ordering (Rose et al., 1976). METIS finds
an ordering that generates an approximation of a minimum fill—in
edge—set and this ordering can be used for finding cliques in the tri—
angulated graph (Galinier et al., 1995). As we mentioned earlier,
these cliques correspond to dense subgraphs in the original graph.
To construct maximal dense subgraphs, we additionally merge sub—
graph connected by many edges.

IGREPERTOIRECONSTRUCTOR solves the Minimum Fill—in Problem
in the Bounded Hamming Graph using METIS and converts its solu—
tion into a list of dense subgraphs in the original Bounded Hamming
Graph. Note that some of the resulting dense subgraphs may share
vertices forcing us to assign these shared vertices to one of the dense
subgraphs. To assign a vertex v to a single dense subgraph, we select
a subgraph with maximum number of vertices adjacent to 11. Thus,
dense subgraphs generated by METIS provide us with a vertex de—
composition of the Bounded Hamming Graph. A vertex decompos—
ition of the graph in Figure 2a is shown in Figure 3 (top right).

Analysis of all found subgraphs in the decomposition of the
Bounded Hamming Graph reveals that the lion’s share of them have
high edge fill—ins (the average edge fill—in is 0.94), thus confirming
that IGREPERTOIRECONSTRUCTOR indeed finds dense subgraphs of the
Bounded Hamming Graph. The histogram of edge fill—in for all sub—
graphs in this decomposition is shown in Supplementary Figure A5.

Dense subgraphs correspond to clusters of Ig—seq reads represent—
ing either identical or very similar antibodies (i.e. antibodies differ—
ing by very few substitutions). However, to construct the antibody
repertoire, we need to further partition some of the dense subgraphs
(that correspond to multiple antibodies) into subgraphs correspond—
ing to single antibodies. To illustrate this challenge, consider the
SHM—triggering patterns RGYW/WRCY (Rogozin and Kolchanov,
1992) and define an edge in the Bounded Hamming Graph as an

SHM—edge if at least one mismatch on this edge conforms to the
RGYW/WRCY motif. Figure 3 (bottom left) shows the Bounded
Hamming Graph where the SHM—edges are highlighted in orange.
This coloring reveals that the yellow dense subgraph in Figure 3
(upper right) corresponds to two similar antibodies rather than to a
single one [Fig. 3 (bottom right)]. Indeed, the multiple alignment of
reads corresponding to the yellow subgraph shows a mismatch in
the CDR1 region which separates reads into two groups (right panel
of Fig. 3). Thus, we need to split the constructed dense subgraphs
using detected SHMs. The final solution is shown in Figure 3
(bottom right) and illustrated in Figure 2b. See Appendix C for more
details on splitting dense subgraphs, and Appendices D and E on
benchmarking of IGREPERTOIRECONSTRUCTOR on real and simulated
antibody Ig—seq datasets.

2.61mmunoproteogenomics search

The previous immunoproteogenomics studies (Boutz et al., 2014;
Cheung et al., 2012; Sato et al., 2012) conducted searches on a data—
base of unique Ig—seq reads that we refer to as unique reads data—
base. We argue that a better option is the antibody repertoire
database (formed by centers of clusters constructed by
IGREPERTOIRECONSTRUCTOR) as it eliminates many sequencing errors.
Furthermore, to assess the divergence from reference gene—segments,
a dataset of canonical V, D and ] gene—segments was searched; this
database is termed the canonical VD] database. In order to obtain
peptide identifications from the constant region, we also included all
41 intact variants of the constant region, obtained from the IMGT
repository (Lefranc et al., 2009). These sequences are concatenated
to the VD] database.

Proteomic searches were conducted using MS—GF+ (Kim et al.,
2008; Kim and Pevzner, 2014) on partially digested peptides (e.g.
for trypsin, semi—tryptic peptides were considered). The FDR was
controlled by selecting a MS—GF+ threshold of spectral probabilities
such that we maintained a 1% FDR. Supplementary Figure A6
shows the distribution of spectral probabilities for the target and
decoy datasets.

Blind modification searches were performed using MODa (Na et
al., 2012), allowing for a single modification with mass between
—200 and 200Da. Peptides with at least one enzymatic end were
considered and a 1% FDR was enforced.

As discussed in Boutz et al. (2014), immunoproteogenomics
searches require new algorithmic and statistical approaches since the
standard peptide identification algorithms were not designed for
searches in large and highly repetitive immunoproteogenomics data—
bases. We argue that yet another key difference between the stand—
ard and immunoproteogenomics searches is that, in the latter case,
after constructing the antibody repertoire, we have information
about antibody abundances. Because higher—abundance antibodies
are more promising candidates for spectral searches than lower—
abundance antibodies (despite limited correlation between
genomics— and proteomics—derived abundances), we partition all
antibodies into layers according to their abundances. The rationale
for such partitioning is that higher—abundance antibodies form much
smaller protein databases than lower—abundance antibodies. For ex—
ample, there are 1564, 10782 and 48564 antibodies with abun—
dances in the intervals from 100 to 30 000, from 10 to 99 and from
2 to 9, respectively. This contrasts with 2 267 863 singleton antibod—
ies with abundance 1. Thus, since E—values of PSMs rapidly deterior—
ate with the increase in the database size (Gupta et al., 2011), we
partition all antibodies into four layers (according the abundance
intervals specified earlier) and employ a separate 1% FDR control,

for each layer, based on selecting a spectral probability threshold in
MS—GF+. Note that our multi—layer approach is very different from
the two-stage MS/MS search approach with logical dependencies be—
tween two stages. Because there are no such dependencies in the
multi—layer approach, the controversy about the statistical founda—
tions of the two—stage approach (Gupta et al., 2011) does not extend
to our multi—layer approach.

3 Discussion

3.1 Datasets

We have benchmarked IGREPERTOIRECONSTRUCTOR on multiple
Mi—Seq and Orbitrap datasets. Below we only describe the results
for a single heavy chain dataset. Similarly to BayesHammer, the run—
ning time of IGREPERTOIRECONSTRUCTOR is dominated by the con—
struction of the Bounded Hamming graph (z 5 h for the heavy
chain dataset). All further steps (finding and splitting dense sub—
graphs, etc.) took > 30min on a single thread. MS searches and sub—
sequent cluster/clone peptide assignments took z 8 h.

3.1.1 Ig-seq dataset

The Ig—seq library contains overlapping paired—end reads that cover
the variable region of heavy chain (3.83 million 250—nt long reads
with average insert size 366 nucleotides). We pre—process the Ig—seq
library by merging overlapping paired—end reads, and removing con—
taminants as described in Appendix F. After pre—processing,
IGREPERTOIRECONSTRUCTOR generated 2 925 095 unique reads,
2406 121 clustered reads and 586 341 clones. See Appendix G for
the analysis of contaminants.

3.1.2 Spectral dataset

We analyzed CID tandem mass—spectra generated using the follow—
ing digestive enzymes; AspN (21 385 spectra), chymotrypsin (24 956
spectra), trypsin (26 740 spectra) and elastase (20 604 spectra).
Enzymes with differing cleavage specificity improve coverage over
the length of the antibody sequence. We searched spectral datasets
against the protein databases derived from the antibody repertoire.
Three—frame translations were created for each antibody in the rep—
ertoire, and any frames containing a stop codon were discarded;
165 675 antibodies (z7%) had a stop codon in all frames.

3.4 Analysis of antibody repertoires

Below we compare the repertoires formed by unique reads and by
IGREPERTOIRECONSTRUCTOR. To compare the repertoires, we used
various metrics measuring cluster sizes [# clusters, # singletons (sin—
gle—element clusters), max cluster size, # clusters of size exceeding
X (where X is a parameter)] as well as metrics based on CDR3 ana—
lysis (see Appendix H for more details). Table 1 illustrates that
IGREPERTOIRECONSTRUCTOR generates a rather different (more com—
pact) representation of antibodies than the set of unique reads used
in previous immunoproteogenomics studies.

3.5 Peptide identifications

Table 2 shows the number of identified peptides and PSMs.
Modified peptides are considered identical to those without modifi—
cations should their sequences be the same; and hence are not
counted when considering unique peptides. Note the large number
of peptides identified only with modifications (i.e. unmodified ver—
sions of these peptides were not identified) suggesting that future
immunoproteogenomics searches should include search for post—
translational modification (PTMs). Overall, we identify nearly 13%

of all spectra when performing restrictive PTM searches at 1%
FDR. The number of identified peptides is further boosted when em—
ploying a multi—layer strategy, noted by the ‘layer’ column in the
table. Blind modification search was performed on the trypsin

The avg. clone divergence metric is computed as the fraction of the number
of columns in the multiple alignment of all antibodies in a clone that have mu—
tations or indels. The avg. non—trivial clone divergence shows the average
clone divergence computed over all non-trivial clones.

dataset only (since MODa is not designed for spectral datasets gen—
erated with other digestive enzymes). MODa identified 3334 PSMs
with modifications, corresponding to 970 peptide IDs; 815 of which
were identified only by the blind modification search. It brings the
total percentage of identified spectra to z 22.6% at 1% FDR
[Cheung et al., (2012) identified 6% of spectra at 2% FDR]. See
Appendix I on specific modifications found by our blind search.
Figure 4c shows the breakdown of the origin of each identified
peptide.

3.6 Assigning peptides to multiple antibodies

Interestingly, only 67124 antibodies (2.6% of all antibodies) did
not encode any identified peptide. Moreover, as expected, these are
mainly antibodies with minimal abundance 1 (total abundance of
these 67 124 antibodies is 73 764 and maximal abundance is 300).
This (surprisingly) low number of antibodies with no peptide
evidence is due to the fact that many identified peptides map to mul—
tiple antibodies. As a result, the number of antibodies A in a reper—
toire R encoding a peptide P is often large. We define exclusivity
score of a peptide as exclusivity (P. R) : 1/number of antibodies
in R encoding P and exclusivity score of an antibody as

eXCIUSiVity (A7  : z:allpeptidesPmappingtoAeXChlSiVity(1)7  The

exclusivity score distribution of the antibodies, seen in Figure 4a,
shows few antibodies having peptides exclusive to them alone [only

The number of peptide identiﬁcations at an 1% FDR cutoff for each spectral dataset. For example, a 1% FDR cutoff corresponds to a spectral probability cut-
off of 1.4e708 for AspN, 2.3e710 for chymotrypsin, 7.5e710 for trypsin and 3.8e710 for elastase datasets, when searching antibodies with the constant region
appended, and restrictive PTM search. The total column shows the number of total peptides, or PSMs, across the four different MS datasets. The total % column
shows the percentage of identiﬁed spectra, among all spectra. The ‘layer’ column denotes the type of search; single layer (s), or multi—layer (m). The restrictive
MS-GF+ searches for PTMs were conducted by searching for carbamidomethyl (C + 57) as a ﬁxed modiﬁcation, oxidation of methionine, oxidation (single and
double) of tryptophan, and N—terminal pyroglutamate (Q—17, E—18) as optional modiﬁcations.

tide depending on whether it overlaps with segments marked as V, D or J regions forthe heavy chain sequence (peptides spanning more than one region, e.g. V

and J, are classified as both V-peptides and J-peptides)

1472 antibodies with exclusivity (A.R) > 1.0]. Figure 4b shows
the peptide coverage over the position of each clone. Supplementary
Figure A7 illustrates the peptide coverage of a single clone.

3.7 Correlation between lg—seq and MS/MS abundances
To compare the relation between peptides and their Ig—seq counter—
parts, we introduce the notions of total Ig—ahundance and maximal
Ig—ahundance of a peptide. Total (maximal) Ig—abundance of a pep—
tide is the total (maximal) abundance of antibodies that encode this
peptide. Supplementary Figure A8a shows the relation of the total
Ig—abundance for each peptide to its spectral count (number of
PSMs). Supplementary Figure A8b shows a histogram of spectral
peptide counts binned over maximal Ig—abundance for each peptide.
A strikingly large number of peptides, 2702, can be attributed to
singleton antibodies. The remarkable lack of correlations between
genomics—based and proteomics—based abundances further amplifies
the concern first expressed in Cheung et al. (2012). Supplementary
Figure A8c shows the correlations between clone abundances meas—
ured by MS/MS and Ig—seq (compare with Supplementary Fig. A9
that measures antibody, rather than clone, abundance). These plots
show the difference when considering the unit of a repertoire (anti—
body), and the unit of antibody evolution (the clone) raising the con—
cern that Ig—seq data do not adequately represent antibody
abundances. When considering only the antibodies, there is no cor—
relation with the MS evidence, as previously reported by Cheung et
al. (2012). However, when considering the amalgam of antibodies
forming each clone, a moderate correlation emerges
(p : 0.5687614). One possible explanation is that certain antibod—
ies, within highly expressed clones, are not captured by MS.

4 Conclusion

Our study is the first to validate the constructed antibody repertoires
(by using complementary proteomics data) that confirmed that
IGREPERTOIRECONSTRUCTOR generates accurate repertoires. With an
accurate tool for constructing antibody repertoires, we can move to
studies of evolution of antibody repertoires, the analysis that has not
been possible in the past. Because analysis of antibody repertoires is
not unlike analysis of repeat subfamilies, the existing algorithms for
analyzing repeat evolution (Cordaux and Batzer, 2009; Price et al.,
2004) can be applied to study evolution of antibodies. We also ad—
dressed the problem of peptide identification in large and highly re—
petitive databases by designing multi—layer immunoproteogenomics
search algorithm. Finally, we revealed an alarming lack of correl—
ation between NGS—based and MS—based quantitation of antibodies
[consistent with Cheung et al. (2012)] and proposed a way to par—
tially restore this correlation by considering clone abundances rather
than individual antibody abundances.

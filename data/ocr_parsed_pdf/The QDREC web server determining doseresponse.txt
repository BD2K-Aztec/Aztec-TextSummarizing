Abstract

Summary: Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) caused by helminths constitute some of the most
common infections of the world’s poorest people. The etiological agents are complex and recalci—
trant to standard techniques of molecular biology. Drug screening against helminths has often
been phenotypic and typically involves manual description of drug effect and efficacy. A key
challenge is to develop automated, quantitative approaches to drug screening against helminth
diseases. The quantal dose—response calculator (QDREC) constitutes a significant step in this
direction. It can be used to automatically determine quantitative dose—response characteristics and
half—maximal effective concentration (EC50) values using image—based readouts from phenotypic
screens, thereby allowing rigorous comparisons of the efficacies of drug compounds. QDREC
has been developed and validated in the context of drug screening for schistosomiasis, one of the
most important NTDs. However, it is equally applicable to general phenotypic screening involving
helminths and other complex parasites.

1 Introduction

 

Neglected tropical diseases caused by helminths, such as schistosom—
iasis, lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis, constitute some of the
most common infections of the world’s poorest people.
Schistosomiasis in particular has been identified as the second most
socioeconomically devastating illness after malaria. It afﬂicts over
200 million people worldwide, and its severe symptoms have been
implicated as prime factors depriving the affected populations of
their health and economic potential. Few drugs are available for

treatment of helminth diseases. For instance, just one, praziquantel,
is available for treatment of schistosomiasis. Emergence of drug re—
sistance is therefore a concern, and there is an urgent need for dis—
covery of new therapies against helminthic illnesses (World Health
Organization, 2013).

Drug screening against helminths poses unique challenges: unlike
model organisms like Caenorhabditis elegans, clones or lines of
worms are not available, the parasites tend to be non—amenable to
target identification using gene knockouts or RNAi, and few

molecular mechanisms of host—parasite interactions are well eluci—
dated. Consequently, lead identification typically involves pheno-
typic screening, where the parasites are exposed to compounds and
leads identified by analyzing the ensuing effects. Such analysis is
non—trivial; drug action typically elicits multiple complex
phenotypes that can overlap and vary over both time and concentra—
tion (see Fig. 1A). Therefore, analysis of phenotypic screening has
tended to employ manual examination, making the process low—
throughput, subjective and non—quantitative.

1.1 Computational challenges

The area of automatic analysis of helminth phenotypes is a complex
challenge. In this area, recent progress has been made in parasite
segmentation (Asarnow and Singh, 2013; Singh et 41]., 2009), para—
site tracking from video recordings (Saha and Singh, 2012) and
quantitative definitions and analysis of helminth phenotypes (Lee
et 41]., 2012; Singh et 41]., 2009), including hit detection in high—
throughput screens (Marcellino et 41]., 2012; Paveley et 41]., 2012).
As yet, however, no automated method exists for determination of
time— and dose—response characteristics, including EC50 values,
based on the output of image—based, phenotypic screens.

2 Quantal dose—response calculator

Quantal dose—response calculator (QDREC) is a web server for
automatically determining quantal time— and dose—response charac—
teristics from image—based, phenotypic drug screens. Given a set of
images recording the time—course exposure of a parasite population,
QDREC image analysis and supervised learning are used to identify
parasites affected by a drug at a given concentration/time point.

The problem of determining the effect of a drug is addressed
using a quantal approach: at each concentration/time point, the
treated and control populations are compared based on the ex—
hibited phenotypes, and the affected parasites are distinguished
using a classification formulation. The number of affected parasites
provides a quantal measure of drug effect. Details on the algorithmic
underpinnings of QDREC can be found in the supporting

information, and a listing of user interaction and processing steps is
included in Supplementary Table S1.

2.1 Design issues and software architecture

QDREC is envisaged to be used by researchers across the world,
provide ease of use and require minimal efforts on maintenance. Its
web—services model was selected to meet the above goals and strike
a balance between issues such as data transfer bandwidth, computa—
tional power for data analysis and the expertise needed to run and
maintain complex software. In QDREC, image compression is used
to mitigate possible bandwidth limitations, while remote execution
relieves the need to have local processing power or software
engineering expertise. The web—services model also permits seamless
software upgrades for all users. Finally, QDREC includes documen—
tation for local execution on all major OS platforms.

2.2 Method and workflow

QDREC involves four major steps: data upload and parasite seg—
mentation, descriptor generation, classification of parasites using
supervised learning and quantification of dose— /time— response. In
the first step, QDREC accepts images recording the responses of
parasite populations to varying experimental conditions (including
compound, concentration and exposure duration), and negative
control images, which record the phenotypes of parasites that have
not been exposed to any compounds. Currently, QDREC works
with static images, which constitutes the most common data capture
mode in phenotypic screening. Next, the parasites in the images are
segmented using the algorithm described in (Asarnow and Singh,
2013), which was designed to surmount difficulties presented by
schistosomula in phenotypic screens, including variation in morph—
ology, texture and behavior, as well as presence of multiple touching
parasites. The segmentation algorithm avoids a priori shape models
in favor of a signal—driven bottom—up approach, employing a novel
edge classifier to split any foreground regions containing multiple
parasites. Default parameters are optimized specifically for segmen—
tation of schistosomula in unstained, bright—field micrographs of
whole wells in 24—well plates at 5>< magnification. Additional seg—
mentation methods provided in the software are summarized in
Table 1. QDREC provides users the opportunity to review the seg—
mented images and to repeat segmentation with user—specified par—
ameters if so required.

Parasite phenotypes are quantified using 71 image—based features
(Lee et 41]., 2012). These features are generally robust to changes in
illumination and are not specifically tailored to schistosomula.
Therefore, they may be used for describing other organisms. A fuller
description of these features is provided in the supporting
information.

To ensure that the controls exclude unhealthy parasites, the
aforementioned feature vectors are used to exclude non—normal
parasites from the control population. Further, to account for nat—
ural variation between parasite subpopulations (which can be sig—
nificant), each parasite is represented both by its own feature vector
as well as one representative of the control parasites from the sample
it was drawn from. In the classification stage, either the feature vec—
tors (one—stage classification) or feature vector tuples (two—stage
classification) are used to assess whether or not a given parasite dif—
fers significantly from its controls. See the supporting information
Section 4.5 for details on the relative merits of one— and two—stage
classification in QDREC.

See Asarnow and Singh (2013) for detailed comparisons of the ﬁrst three methods. Object count discrepancy (0CD) is the proportion of parasites not correctly
segmented, mean boundary deviation (MBD) is the average distance (in pixels) between true and segmented boundary contours. The Asarnow-Singh segmentation
method has the best performance, identifying ~96 % of the parasites and localizing their boundaries to within 1.3 pixels on average.

Classiﬁcation accuracy and the mean and standard deviation of NRMSE, correlation and log10(P—value) are shown for 12 drugs (ator-
vastatin, ﬂuvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin, closantel, ibandronate, K11777, niclosamide, praziquantel and sor—
afenib). Correlation P-values were determined using Student’s t—distribution. The non—linear SVM is used in QDREC as the default
classiﬁer because it exhibited less parameter sensitivity and more reliable convergence than the linear SVM. All results are for two—stage

classiﬁcation using parasite and control feature vector tuples.

annotated by four human experts, whose training decisions were
combined using majority voting. Alternatively, users may choose to
employ a point—and—click interface to annotate individual parasites
and train their own one— or two—stage classifier instances using one
of the following classification methods provided in the software:
linear SVM, non—linear SVM (NL—SVM), Naive Bayes or Random
Forest. The 10—fold cross—validated classification accuracy over the
training set for the NL—SVM was found to be 90.7%. The cross—vali—
dated accuracies for the other classifiers are given in Table 2 and
Supplementary Table S3, for two—stage and one—stage classification,
respectively.

Finally, parasite classifications are used to compute the quantal
phenotypic response for each test image, as well as the aggregate re—
sponse for each unique combination of experimental conditions.
Results are then displayed in both tabular and graphical form.
Figure 1B shows an example dose—response plot produced by
QDREC.

2.3 Experiments and validation

QDREC has been validated using a blind test set of 5798 schistoso—
mula, which were expert annotated, but not used to train the pro—
vided classifier(s). Performance was evaluated by classification
accuracy, as well as through direct comparison of manual and auto—
matic dose—response curves using normalized root—mean—square
error (NRMSE) and Pearson correlation. Classification accuracy for
the provided NL—SVM classifier was 90.5%, while dose—response
curves exhibited a correlation of 0.984 (P—value 0.0012) and an
NRMSE of 0.13. These results indicate that the parasite classifica—
tions and dose—response curves produced by QDREC are compar—
able to those obtained by experts. Complete results, including the

other classification frameworks, are given in Table 2 and
Supplementary Table S3, for two—stage and one—stage classification,
respectively. The relative performances of one— and two—stage classi—
fication for larger, more diverse datasets is explored using additional
data consisting of 23 867 schistosomula imaged with variable light—
ing, well density and depth of focus. The results of this analysis are
given in Supplementary Table S4 and Table S5, for one— and two—
stage classification, respectively.

As a final assessment, QDREC was used to analyze 118 images
of schistosomula exposed to compounds not used in the previous ex—
periment. A survey was conducted to determine how closely 10 ex—
perts agreed with the QDREC output on a five—point Likert scale.
Participants were shown corresponding pairs of control and drug—
exposed images, along with the per—image quantal—response scores
obtained using QDREC and asked to quantify their assessment of
QDREC on the aforementioned Likert scale. A histogram of the re—
sulting scores is presented in Figure 1C. Although some disagree—
ment was found (due to segmentation and classification errors as
well as disagreement between the human experts), the proportion of
such cases was small (<30%). The distribution of scores underlines
that results from QDREC are consistent with user assessments of
phenotypic response.

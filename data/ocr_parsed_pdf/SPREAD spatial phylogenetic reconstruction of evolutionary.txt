ABSTRACT

Summary: SPREAD is a user-friendly, cross-platform application
to analyze and visualize Bayesian phylogeographic reconstructions
incorporating spatial—temporal diffusion. The software maps
phylogenies annotated with both discrete and continuous spatial
information and can export high-dimensional posterior summaries
to keyhole markup language (KML) for animation of the spatial
diffusion through time in virtual globe software. In addition, SPREAD
implements Bayes factor calculation to evaluate the support for
hypotheses of historical diffusion among pairs of discrete locations
based on Bayesian stochastic search variable selection estimates.
SPREAD takes advantage of multicore architectures to process
large joint posterior distributions of phylogenies and their spatial
diffusion and produces visualizations as compelling and interpretable
statistical summaries for the different spatial projections.

1 INTRODUCTION

The advent of powerful and ﬂexible Geographic Information
Systems (GIS) has fostered an increasing interest in incorporating
geographical information into molecular phylogenetic methods.
Spatial phylogenetic projections in a cartographic background
play an important role in these developments (Kidd and Ritchie,
2006; Parks et al., 2009), but most applications remain limited to
mapping phylogenetic tip taxa to their geographical coordinates.
Mapping phylogeographic histories of geo-referenced taxa requires
a robust statistical estimate of the geographic locations at the
ancestral nodes of the tree. To obtain such estimates under
stochastic process-driven models, we recently proposed a suite
of Bayesian inference approaches for the joint reconstruction of
evolutionary and geographic history (Bloomquist et al., 2010;
Lemey et (11., 2009, 2010). Models that accommodate spatial
diffusion in discrete and continuous space have been implemented
in a ﬂexible Bayesian statistical framework (BEAST, Drummond
et al., 2007; http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk) for hypothesis testing

based on time-measured evolutionary histories. These approaches
produce statistical distributions of temporal-spatial phylogenies and
this has created new challenges for statistical phylogenetics in
producing informative and compelling visualizations. Here, we
present software to fully exploit spatial—temporal annotations on
phylogenies by providing ﬂexible visual summaries that can be
further examined in an interactive manner using GIS or virtual globe
software.

2 FEATURES

SPREAD provides four templates to analyze and visualize different
aspects of phylogeographic diffusion, labeled: Discrete Tree,
Discrete Bayes Factors, Continuous Tree and Time Slicer. The
discrete and continuous tree templates typically provide posterior
summaries of diffusion from a Bayesian analysis along a high-
probability tree, such as the maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree
of BEAST. However, SPREAD is not necessarily limited to this
input, as it employs a general, trait-annotated NEXUS format; we
provide several tree ﬁle examples for both discrete or continuous
annotations (Compiled, runnable package and supplementary
data are hosted at: http://www.phylogeography.org/SPREAD.html).
SPREAD supports customized visualization of spatially mapped
trees, including branch coloring according to time and branch width
manipulation.

Discrete tree associates geographic coordinates with the discrete
location states annotated to tree nodes and projects branches that
accommodate location changes on a map. Branches that maintain a
location state are visualized using customizable circular polygons.

Discrete Bayes factors summarizes the data support for each
pairwise rate of diffusion between locations based on Bayesian
stochastic search variable selection estimates inferred using BEAST.
This template takes as input a posterior sample of rate indicators
from an augmented continuous-time Markov chain model and the
Poisson prior speciﬁcations for the total number of non-zero rates.
Lemey et al. (2009) describe the Bayes factor calculations in more
detail.

Continuous tree maps all branches of a continuous diffusion
phylogeography and allows plotting the uncertainty of geographic
coordinates at the internal nodes through their annotated highest
posterior density contours.

Time slicer supplements the visualization of geographic
locations estimated using continuous diffusion by summarizing

the rate and degree of geographical movement over the complete
posterior distribution of trees. To obtain such ranges, we slice each
rooted tree in the posterior sample at a number of points within a time
interval, usually deﬁned by the length of a summary (MCC) tree,
and impute the unobserved ancestral locations for each branch that
intersects those time points. To fully accommodate the uncertainty
of the original inference, the imputation involves building Brownian
bridges that can take into account branch-speciﬁc scaling factors of
difﬁision rates under relaxed random walks (Lemey et al., 2010).
For each time point, we collect the imputed locations across the
posterior distribution and use bivariate kernel density estimates
to plot the highest posterior density contours. The kernel density
estimation follows (Snyder, 1978) and uses bivariate normal kernels
with a diagonal bandwidth with bandwidths based on Silverman’s
‘rule-of—thumb’ plug-in value (Silverman, 1978).

3 EXAMPLE AND PERSPECTIVES

For all four template analyses, SPREAD offers direct visualization
and also can export the mapped objects to a KML ﬁle suitable
for viewing with virtual globe software, such as Google Earth
(http://earth.google.com). A limited example on raccoon rabies
difﬁision (Lemey et (11., 2010) ﬁnds itself in Figure 1; dynamic
visualizations of this example as well as others are provided at
http://www.phylogeography.org/. KML ﬁles can be imported and
visualized by many GIS software packages, including ARCGIS and
Cartographica.

SPREAD is generally not the run time limiting analysis,
compared with ﬁtting the original phylogenetic model, and readily
accommodates larger problems. Even for Bayesian phylogenetic
analyses, Thousands of pathogen sequences can be accommodated,
e.g. (Rambaut et al., 2008), and new computational technologies
are actively stretching these limits (Suchard and Rambaut, 2009).
Future developments of SPREAD are aimed at extending built-in
rendering ﬁinctionality such as parsing custom base maps and adding
mouse-driven camera support to the embedded renderings.

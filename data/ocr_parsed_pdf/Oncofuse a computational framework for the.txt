ABSTRACT

Motivation: Gene fusions resulting from chromosomal aberrations are
an important cause of cancer. The complexity of genomic changes in
certain cancer types has hampered the identification of gene fusions
by molecular cytogenetic methods, especially in carcinomas. This is
changing with the advent of next-generation sequencing, which is de-
tecting a substantial number of new fusion transcripts in individual
cancer genomes. However, this poses the challenge of identifying
those fusions with greater oncogenic potential amid a background
of ‘passenger’ fusion sequences.

Results: In the present work, we have used some recently identified
genomic hallmarks of oncogenic fusion genes to develop a pipeline for
the classification of fusion sequences, namely, Oncofuse. The pipeline
predicts the oncogenic potential of novel fusion genes, calculating the
probability that a fusion sequence behaves as ‘driver’ of the oncogenic
process based on features present in known oncogenic fusions.
Cross-validation and extensive validation tests on independent data-
sets suggest a robust behavior with good precision and recall rates.
We believe that Oncofuse could become a useful tool to guide experi-
mental validation studies of novel fusion sequences found during
next-generation sequencing analysis of cancer transcriptomes.
Availability and implementation: Oncofuse is a naive Bayes Network
Classiﬁer trained and tested using Weka machine learning package.
The pipeline is executed by running a Java/Groovy script, available for
download at www.unav.es/genetica/oncofuse.html.

1 INTRODUCTION

One of the most common types of somatic mutation in the
human cancer gene census involves chromosomal translocations
that fuse two different genes, resulting in a chimeric transcript
(Futreal et al., 2004). It is estimated that ~20% of all cancers are
caused by gene fusions driven by chromosomal translocations
(Nambiar et al., 2008), and the number of reported clinical
cases is growing rapidly. There is compelling evidence that
fusions represent an initial event in oncogenesis (Mitelman
et al., 2007) and play an important role in aggressive cancer
cases (Villanueva, 2012). Many gene fusions are translated as
fusion proteins with oncogenic potential due to the presence of

protein domains that are normally located in separate proteins.
Examples of recurrent fusions are BCR-ABLl, which is present
in chronic myeloid leukemia cases (Ren, 2005), or TMPRSS2—
ERG, found in prostate cancers (Rosen et al., 2012). Most
chromosomal translocations involved in cancer cases are
described in several databases. For example, hundreds of gene
fusions associated with clinical reports are included in Mitelman
database (http: //cgap.nci.nih. gov/Chro-mosomes/Mitelman), al-
though it does not contain sequence data. Our database of
fusion sequences TICdb (Novo et al., 2007; http://www.unav.
es/genetica/TICdb/) allows the precise mapping of breakpoint
positions and facilitates analysis of the structure of fusion
genes. Another database, chimerDB2.0 (Kim et al., 2010;
http://ercsb.ewha.ac.kr:8080/FusionGene/), contains several
thousand putative fusions predicted solely from sequences
present in publicly available databases.

Owing to the complex type of rearrangements sustained by the
genomes of solid tumors, most gene fusions have been identiﬁed
and characterized in hematological (HEM) neoplasms. However,
novel next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies coupled
with sophisticated algorithms allow the detection of gene fusions
with extraordinary sensitivity even in solid tumors: some reliable
predictions detect fusion junctions at <0.05 sequencing reads per
million (Kim and Salzberg, 2011; Sakarya et al., 2012). It is rea-
sonable to expect that this unprecedented sensitivity will lead to
the discovery of hundreds of novel and rare fusion sequences in
various cancer types, raising the question of how many of these
mutations are important for cancer development and not just
passenger events. This is even more relevant in the context of
emerging data obtained from high-throughput studies (Frenkel—
Morgenstern et al., 2012), which demonstrate the presence of
fusion transcripts in normal cells, as had been suggested in earlier
studies (Akiva et al., 2006; Parra et al., 2006).

To solve this issue, a deep understanding of fusion-driven
oncogenesis is required. The enrichment of certain combinations
of functional domains and domain families in gene fusions has
been highlighted by previous studies (Frenkel—Morgenstern et al.,
2012; Ortiz de Mendibil et al., 2009). Likewise, we have recently
identiﬁed some genomic hallmarks of oncogenic fusion genes
using information from public databases (Shugay et al., 2012).
In addition to promoter or untranslated region (UTR) swapping
that leads to well-known expression changes in fusion proteins,
these hallmarks include the combination of speciﬁc protein do-
mains and protein interaction interfaces (PIIs) with novel onco-
genic functions, as well as features related to replication timing.
We reasoned that this set of features could be used to predict the
oncogenic potential of novel fusion sequences found in tumor

samples. In this work, we present Oncofuse, a robust Bayesian
classiﬁer that identiﬁes fusion genes that could behave as ‘dri-
vers’ of the oncogenic process, based on their shared properties
with known oncogenic fusions.

A previous work by Wang et a]. (2009) represented the first
attempt to distinguish ‘driver’ and ‘passenger’ mutations by
incorporating interactome, pathway and Gene Ontology (GO)
information to rank the genes under consideration. Here, we
have followed a different approach, as our goal is to predict
whether a given fusion sequence is ‘driver’. In this regard, our
tool is focused on fusion sequences, whereas previous strategies
were gene-centered (predicting whether a gene is likely to
undergo a fusion). Notably, a recent article deals with the prob-
lem of distinguishing ‘driver’ and ‘passenger’ missense point
mutations (not gene fusions) using a classiﬁer trained on a
large number of protein sequence features from positive and
negative sets (Tan et al., 2012). Although not directly comparable
with our pipeline, that study highlights the potential of classiﬁ-
cation strategies for the identiﬁcation of ‘driver’ mutations in
cancer.

2 METHODS

2.1 Gene sets used in study

Supplementary Table S1 provides details of the datasets used in this
study. Fusions reported in cancer patients with mapped breakpoint pos-
itions were taken from TICdb3.0, which included 1134 gene fusion
records as of March 2012 and were used as positive training set. These
fusions were ﬁltered so as to select unique fusions (with respect to domain
composition), thus creating a non-redundant set for classiﬁer training.
Mitelman database of fusions in cancer (http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/
Chromosomes/Mitelman) was used to make an estimate of the recurrence
of speciﬁc fusions. Only unique FPG pairs were selected in this case.

Two datasets were used as negative training set: fusion genes (Frenkel-
Morgenstern et al., 2012) and read-through transcripts (N acu et al., 2011)
found in normal cells. Two positive datasets were used for validation
purposes: fusions discovered in NGS studies in cancer (Asmann et al.,
2012; Benelli et al., 2012; Edgren et al., 2011; Sakarya et al., 2012) and
fusions predicted in chimerDB2.0 (Kim et al., 2010) based on combined
mRNA, expressed sequence tag (EST) and Sequence Read Archive
(SRA) predictions of conﬁdence Class A (i.e. predictions where both
partner genes show reliable alignments). We ﬁltered out fusions in
which genomic data for one FPG were not available.

All RefSeq genes (taken from UCSC Genome Browser repository) and
known oncogenes (according to Sanger Cancer Genome Census, CGC)
were used to test the classiﬁer on non-translocated (unbroken) genes.

2.2 Classiﬁcation procedure

A Naive Bayes Network Classiﬁer was trained and tested using Weka
machine learning package (Frank et al., 2004). We chose a bayesian
classiﬁer over other algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines
(SVM), because it is simple yet robust, and it allows native handling of
missing data values, which is always the case when integrating several
high-throughput biological datasets from different sources. Moreover,
scores are easily interpretable as P-values owing to the probabilistic
nature of the classiﬁer. The classiﬁer was trained using 10-fold cross-
validation, and feature values were discretized using Supervised
Discretization algorithm in Weka package.

We selected 24 features for classiﬁcation of ‘driver’ fusions based on
our previous analysis of fusion gene hallmarks (Shugay et al., 2012).
These include 12 features ‘retained’ and 12 features ‘lost’ in the resulting

fusion gene (e.g. the promoter of the 5’ FPG is retained, whereas the
promoter of the 3’ FPG is lost, and so on). Both ‘retained’ and ‘lost’
features belong to three categories: six functional proﬁle features (gener-
ated as described in the next section), two promoter features, one 3’-UTR
feature and three protein interaction features. The complete list of fea-
tures, as well as additional information on source datasets, is available in
Supplementary Table S2.

2.3 Functional proﬁling pipeline

To generate functional proﬁles for fusion sequences, we ﬁrst had to iden-
tify which functional families are enriched in the set of ‘driver’ fusions. To
this end, we used all fusion sequences from TICdb to query InterPro
database (Hunter et al., 2012) and extract protein features using a local
copy generated and downloaded via BioMart. Protein domains were ‘lost’
or ‘retained’ after fusion depending on their position relative to fusion
junctions. For each protein domain, a representative set of genes was
created carrying at least one instance of that domain. These gene sets
were then subjected to functional analysis using Functional Clusterization
tool at DAVID web server (Huang et al., 2009). This pipeline yielded an
extended set of 4907 genes containing the protein domains present in the
fusions from TICdb (359 unique genes). Manual inspection of the results
led to the identiﬁcation of six categories with E-score >3, representing six
functional families that are signiﬁcantly enriched in the set of ‘driver’
fusion genes: transcription factor (TF), kinase activity, transcription co-
factor, GTPase (G), helicase/histone modiﬁers (H) and protein binding
(P). For each of these functional families, we obtained associated GO
molecular function (GO:MF) terms at a false-discovery rate (FDR)
<10%. The full list of GO:MF-functional family associations is presented
in Supplementary Table S3.

The generation of functional proﬁles for new fusion genes follows the
pipeline described in Supplementary Figure S1. For each new fusion
sequence, protein domains are extracted, and a representative set of
genes containing those domains is generated as mentioned previously.
Then, a functional family association score (FFAS) is calculated as the
number GO:MF terms contained in this gene set that overlap with
GO:MF terms associated with each of the six functional families
described before. These scores are the six functional proﬁle features
used in the classifier.

2.4 Software packages used

Gene annotation analysis was carried out using DAVID web server.
Classiﬁcation was performed using Weka package. GraphPad Prism
was used for statistical tests. All other tasks were performed manually
or using custom Java/Groovy code, available on request.

2.5 Implementation and availability

The pipeline is executed by simply running a Java/Groovy script with
some parameters on a standardized input ﬁle (all required packages are
installed automatically via Groovy/Grape). Users should provide IDs of
fusion partner genes, as well as location of breakpoint (Intron/Exon ID
and coordinate) within the major Refseq transcript of each gene. All ne-
cessary ﬁles with features are included as part of the package. Users could
also specify custom data ﬁles, e.g. a ﬁle with expression data in a tissue of
interest. The output is a simple tab-delimited ﬁle with classiﬁer P-values
(probability of belonging to Class 0 or to Class 1), domains retained in the
fusion and association scores for each of the six functional proﬁles.
Scripts and documentation are available at www.unav.es/genetica/
oncofusehtml. Oncofuse is straightforward to use and supports
multiple input formats to handle the output of several existing fusion
detection software.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Functional proﬁling of fusion proteins

In our previous work, we classiﬁed proteins into functional cate-
gories using Interpro domain annotations. Such approach is not
practical in the present study, as the process would have to be
performed manually every time that a new list of candidate
fusion sequences is analyzed by the classiﬁer. Therefore, we
have developed an automated method that infers functional pro-
ﬁles of proteins based on indirect evidence from GO:MF anno-
tations of the genes containing the same domains (see Section 2),
which allows data to be digitized and mapped to a finite set of
features. This strategy identiﬁed six functional families that are
significantly enriched in the set of ‘driver’ fusion sequences from
TICdb: TF, kinase activity, transcription cofactor, G, helicase/
histone modiﬁers (H) and protein binding (P).

We then applied this same pipeline to fusion genes used as
positive (‘driver’) and negative (‘passenger’) sets during training
and validation, to obtain, for each fusion, a functional profile
that could be sent to the classiﬁer. Figure 1 shows FFAs for
fusions in the two negative datasets (RefSeq genes and fusions
found in normal cells) and in the three positive datasets (fusions
predicted by ChimerDB and from NGS data, CGC oncogenes
and TICdb fusion sequences). As expected, the highest enrich-
ment is obtained for TICdb sequences (as they had been used to
define the functional families). For all functional families, posi-
tive datasets (presumably enriched in ‘driver’ fusions) show sig-
niﬁcant differences relative to RefSeq genes and fusion sequences
from normal cells. This suggests that the pipeline for the gener-
ation of functional proﬁles is capturing the basic properties of
protein domains retained or lost in ‘driver’ gene fusions.

3.2 Classiﬁer training

Having a high number of known fusions (437 non-redundant
fusion entries in TICdb), a robust classiﬁer could be trained if

a suitable negative set is provided. For this, we selected fusion
transcripts detected in normal cells from a recent high-through-
put study (Frenkel—Morgenstern et al., 2012). To balance the
number of positive and negative instances, we extended the nega-
tive training set with read-through transcripts detected in normal
cells (Nacu et al., 2011).

Training the classiﬁer with the complete set of features (k = 24)
yielded high precision and recall rates (>85%) after 10-fold
cross-validation. Using various subsets of features also yielded
reliable results, although overall classiﬁcation accuracy decreased
(Table 1).

To further ensure that data were not overﬁtted, we performed
several classiﬁer training runs with the full set of features by
random partitioning data into training and test sets of equal
size. This led to only a minor drop in accuracy (<5%).
Notably, classiﬁer accuracy was not dependent on the source
of tissue of fusions and was equally high for gene fusions from
epithelial (EPI), HEM and mesenchymal (MES) tissues included
in the training set (data not shown).

The actual information gain afforded by each feature used in
classiﬁcation can be seen in Supplementary Figure S2, with func-
tional profile features providing the largest information gain. As
expected, expression and replication features are most inform-
ative in 5/ FPGs. Interestingly, features related to lost functional
profiles, lost PIIs and self-PIIs provide more information than
their retained counterparts.

3.3 Classiﬁer performance

To test our classiﬁer on independent data sources, we selected
>700 fusions detected in recent NGS studies and >6000 predicted
fusions from chimerDB2.0 (see Supplementary Table SI for de-
tails). Data from chimerDB2.0 include mRNA, EST and
SRA sequences and are partitioned into three conﬁdence classes
(Aihighest conﬁdence, Cilowest confidence). We also tested
protein-coding genes from RefSeq as well as a subset of known
oncogenes from the Cancer Genome Census. For Refseq and
CGC genes, we set the features related to ‘lost upon fusion’ as
unknown variables, as these genes are not taking part in fusions,
and their proteins have not lost any domains.

A table with classiﬁcation results in all these datasets can be
found as additional file. Overall classiﬁcation statistics are pre-
sented in Figure 2. As expected, a small number of RefSeq genes
(1%) were classiﬁed as ‘driver’ fusion genes. Interestingly, about

half of CGC proto-oncogenes showed the pattern characteristic
of ‘driver’ fusions. In addition, Class A fusions from
chimerDB2.0 (high conﬁdence) were predicted to contain more
‘driver’ fusions than less conﬁdence sets B and C. NGS#1 and
NGS#2 sets were predicted to have a similar number of driver
fusions to chimerDB2.0 A and B classes, respectively.

Although these results suggest a good performance of the clas-
sifier, the real number of ‘driver’ fusions in NGS and
chimerDB2.0 datasets is unknown. Therefore, we conducted
additional tests to validate these predictions. First, we performed
KEGG pathway analysis on predicted ‘driver’ fusions and com-
pared them to predicted ‘passenger’ fusions from the same data-
sets (NGS#1, NGS#2 and chimerDB2.0-A). We performed
pathway analysis instead of GO to avoid potential biases
owing to the fact that we had used GO:MF categories in the
construction of the classiﬁer. KEGG annotations clearly
showed that genes involved in fusions predicted to be ‘driver’
are enriched in ‘cancer’ and ‘cell-cell adhesion’ pathways
(including ‘adherens junction formation’ and ‘actin cytoskeleton
remodeling’), whereas no cancer pathways were enriched in the
set of fusions classiﬁed as ‘passenger’ (Supplementary Fig. S3).
We also note that genes from fusions classiﬁed as ‘driver’ are
enriched in EPI-speciﬁc genes (n:299 or 32%,
FDR: 1.3 x 10—44) according to manual InterPro classiﬁcation
(UP_TIS-SUE track in DAVID). This could be due to the fact
that samples from NGS datasets are mostly of EPI origin. The
same is found (although to a less extent, 23% of genes) for genes
involved in ‘passenger’ fusions. As expected, fusions predicted to
be ‘driver’ are more enriched (8.6-fold, FDR: 1.2 x 10—37) in
genes associated with ‘chromosomal rearrangements’
(SP_PIR_KEY-WORDS track in DAVID) than predicted ‘pas-
senger’ fusions (3.1-fold, FDR: 5.6 x 10—6).

Typically, mutations are said to be ‘driver’ if they are recur-
rent, appearing in different samples or in different tumor types.
As NGS#1 and NGS#2 datasets include sequencing data from
several cancer cell lines (BT474, MCF7, SKBR3, KPL4 and
NCIH660), their analysis could identify recurrent fusion genes.
We detected 11 and 3 unique fusion gene pairs that were
present in two or in three different cell lines, respectively.
Although Oncofuse only predicted a ‘driver’ status for 24% of

non-recurrent fusions, it classiﬁed as ‘driver’ 7 of 14 fusions
(50%) found in more than one cell line (P:0.017, hypergeo—
metric test). This supports that Oncofuse is correctly identifying
those fusions which are likely to be oncogenic. The list of recur-
rent fusions and predicted drivers is provided in Supplementary
Table S4. However, it is worth noting that four other recurrent
fusions from these datasets (ARPC4—TTLL3, C15orf38-AP3S2,
RPLl7L—C18orf32 and RPSlO—NUDT3) were also found as
read-through transcripts in normal cells; therefore, their true
oncogenic potential is unclear. Interestingly, all of them were
classiﬁed as ‘passenger’ by Oncofuse.

To further estimate the conﬁdence of the predictions that a
fusion is ‘driver’, we checked whether the P—Values assigned by
the classiﬁer are correlated with the clinical frequency of fusions
included in TICdb (i.e. those used as positive dataset during
training). Taking the number of reports in Mitelman database
as an estimate of recurrence (clinical frequency), we observed
that fusions reported two or more times (i.e. recurrent) were
assigned significantly lower P—Values than fusions reported only
once (Fig. 3A). Simple correlation analysis of (log frequency)
versus (-log P value) yields R:0.22, which is a significant de-
pendence with P: 3 x 10—5. We note that this correlation is not
due to the fact that more frequent fusions are used repeatedly
during training (overﬁtting) because the classiﬁer was trained on
a translocation set in which redundancy had been removed (up
to domain composition). When we calculated partial correlations
for two of the three variables (P—Value, clinical frequency and
number of times that a fusion appeared in the training set) while
controlling for the remaining one, we obtained a partial correl-
ation coefﬁcient R : 0.16 (P:0.002) between P—Value and clin-
ical frequency, but no signiﬁcant dependence (R : 0.08, P>0.1)
between P—Value and number of instances in the training set.
Furthermore, we investigated the performance of the classiﬁer
with reciprocal fusion sequences, which are occasionally detected
at low levels alongside fusion transcripts. Reciprocal fusion tran-
scripts usually lack the potential to code for the protein domains
that are required for oncogenic activity, so they are generally
regarded as ‘passenger’ events. In agreement with this, we
found that P—Values given by the classiﬁer to original fusions
are signiﬁcantly lower than P—Values assigned to their reciprocal
counterparts (Fig. 3B).

Finally, we investigated whether the P—Values given by the
classiﬁer might also reﬂect the tissue-speciﬁcity of fusions, as
they are partially based on gene expression data. In this analysis,
we omitted fusion genes for which no expression data were avail-
able. The classiﬁer assigned more signiﬁcant P—Values in the
correct tissue of origin of gene fusions compared with other tis-
sues (Fig. 3C).

This is interesting because the original features used to con-
struct the classiﬁer were identiﬁed on fusions mostly from HEM
malignancies; therefore, its performance might decrease in other
tissue types. To address this issue, we analyzed the expression
levels of 5/ fusion partner genes in three tissue types (EPI, MES
and HEM). As shown in Figure 4, expression of 5/ fusion partner
genes is signiﬁcantly higher in the tissue where the fusion was
identiﬁed, compared with the other two tissues. This suggests
that the inclusion of some gene fusions found in MES and EPI
cancers will enable the classiﬁer to perform well in new fusion
sequences detected in these tissue types.

3.4 Validation on independent datasets

Validation of this novel classiﬁer poses a real challenge because
the true number of ‘driver’ gene fusions in available datasets is
unknown. As comprehensive experimental validation of hun-
dreds of predictions is not feasible, the real predictive potential
of our algorithm will only become evident a posteriori, as new
oncogenic gene fusions are described in the literature. To test
this, we asked whether Oncofuse would have correctly assigned
‘driver’ status to fusion sequences published after the construc-
tion of the classiﬁer.

We extracted form the literature gene fusions recently
described in cancer, as well as all fusions included in the latest
update of TICdb (from April 2012 to March 2013). Table 2 lists
these fusions (with PubMed IDs to their references) and their
classiﬁcation by Oncofuse. We found that 79% of the new
fusions (23 of 29) were classiﬁed as ‘driver’, a recall rate similar
to that obtained in cross-validation analysis of the classiﬁer.

As Oncofuse is intended to help researchers to identify the
‘true’ fusion genes in a list of candidates that are obtained

from gene fusion detection algorithms, we also checked the
performance of the classiﬁer on novel gene fusion data derived
out of NGS platforms. For instance, we ranked all fusions from
a set of predictions made in four breast cancer cell lines (BT474,
KPL4, MCF7 and SKBR3, data available from http://code.
google.com/p/fusion—catcher/). In this dataset, FusionCatcher
identiﬁed 29 unique significant FPG pairs. Of those, Oncofuse
assigned ‘driver’ status to ﬁve pairs with a P<0.01. We then
performed manual literature mining to determine which of the
29 fusions have been shown to have oncogenic potential. As
shown in Supplementary Table S5, the only proven oncogenic
fusions were RPS6KB1-VMP1 and VAPB-IKZF3, which were
ranked by Oncofuse #3 and #5 with high signiﬁcance.

We also explored whether the P-values given by Oncofuse
could be used to rank fusions in the case when multiple ‘drivers’
are present in one sample. We analyzed all fusions identiﬁed by
FusionFinder in RNA-Seq data from chronic myeloid leukemia
cell line K562 (Francis et al., 2012). Running Oncofuse on
this dataset led to the identiﬁcation of BCR-ABLl
(P: 5 x 10—9), NUP98-FKBP5 (P: 5 x 10—6), NUP98-
JHDMlD (P: 6 x 10-4), NUP98-IGF2BP2 (P : 7 x 10-4) and
DDB2—ALS2 (P : 1 x 10—3) as putative ‘drivers’ with a threshold
of P< 10—2. It is interesting that BCR-ABLl, which plays a cru-
cial role in CML (Ren, 2005) and is known to be present in this
cell line, was ranked #1 in this list. Although the other three
fusions have not been tested experimentally, fusions involving
NUP98 are known drivers of HEM malignancies (Gough
et al., 2011). These examples illustrate how Oncofuse could
help to prioritize for experimental validation lists of candidate
fusion genes detected in RNA-seq studies.

4 DISCUSSION

It is estimated that ~20% of all cancers are caused by gene
fusions driven by chromosomal translocations (Mitelman et al.,
2007; Nambiar et al., 2008), but it is reasonable to predict that
this ﬁgure will increase during the next years, as more samples
from solid tumors, notably EPI, will be analyzed with NGS
technologies. Sequencing of cancer transcriptomes will yield
large lists of chimeric fusion genes, and it will be a challenge to
identify which of those are actually contributing to the initiation
or progression of cancer.

The oncogenic role of gene fusions, like other types of muta-
tions, is usually judged by their recurrence: if they are found in
different samples or in different tumor types they are considered
to be important for cancer development. However, this view is
probably over-simplistic, considering recent findings showing
that many mutations important for cancer development are ‘pri—
vate’ (i.e. non-recurrent) because the same biological pathways
can be inactivated by mutations in different genes (Bozic et al.,
2010; Vogelstein et al., 2013). Furthermore, it is unclear that all
recurrent fusion sequences must necessarily be oncogenic. For
instance, we found four recurrent fusions in NGS data from
cancer cells that were also present as natural read-through tran-
scripts in normal cells. It is reasonable to predict that the increas-
ing use of RNA-seq to interrogate cancer genomes will yield
‘recurrent’ fusions that will turn out to be passenger events, ren-
dering recurrence a weaker argument for oncogenic potential.

Therefore, it is necessary to develop tools to reliably predict
the oncogenic potential of gene fusions that play a significant
role in cancer development, regardless of whether they are
recurrent.

In this article, we present Oncofuse, a novel algorithm that
provides an accurate classiﬁcation of ‘driver’ and ‘passenger’
fusion genes with probability estimates, which could be of
great help to rank fusions detected by NGS in tumor samples
and thus prioritize experimental validation studies. A summary
of the analysis pipeline used in this study is presented in
Supplementary Figure S4. Building on our previous identifica-
tion of several genomic hallmarks of oncogenic (‘driver’) fusion
sequences, we generated a carefully selected set of genomic fea-
tures that were used to train a Bayesian classiﬁer showing good
precision and recall rates in cross-validation studies. Thus, when
a researcher is faced with a list of fusion genes detected by NGS
studies in cancer genomes, Oncofuse will extract the same set of
genomic features and will return a P-value for the probability
that each fusion in the list is ‘driver’, as well as some additional
information about its functional profile.

We observed that functional proﬁles of fusion proteins provide
a substantial amount of information on whether a fusion is likely
to be ‘driver’. Molecular functions related to TF, transcription
co-factor, kinase, histone modification, protein isomerization
and GTPase-related are enriched in ‘driver’ fusion proteins.
This is consistent with our previous observations in HEM malig-
nancies (Shugay et al., 2012) and seems to be a common hall-
mark of all ‘driver’ gene fusions, regardless their tissue of origin
(NGS#l and NGS#2 datasets used in this study are exclusively
of EPI origin). This is a important point because it justiﬁes the
use of the same classiﬁer for fusions from different sources by
adjusting only gene expression features. The fact that tissue-spe-
ciﬁc expression patterns of 5’ fusion partner genes are robustly
replicated for the three tissues examined in this study helps to
explain that Oncofuse assigns more signiﬁcant P-values in the
tissue where a fusion was identiﬁed compared with other tissues.
Thus, even though the original features used to construct the
classiﬁer were based on insights taken mostly from HEM malig-
nancies, Oncofuse will also classify gene fusions from MES and
EPI cancers if expression data of both partner genes are
provided.

Although there are a few algorithms for the identiﬁcation of
chimeric fusion sequences in NGS data, the only attempt (to the
best of our knowledge) to distinguish ‘driver’ from ‘passenger’
rearrangements was performed by Chinnaiyan and colleagues in
2009 (Wang et al., 2009). However, our strategy is different in
several important aspects. First, Wang et al. made their predic-
tions based on the properties of entire partner genes, such as GO
annotations and their position in the interactome, whereas we
use features retained or lost in fusion genes (or in the proteins
encoded by them). These features, like the loss of speciﬁc protein
domains, the co-occurrence of domain combinations or pro-
moter and 3’-UTR swapping, could yield information that is
not correctly described by simply summarizing the annotations
of the parent genes (Frenkel-Morgenstern and Valencia, 2012;
Hegyi et al., 2009). Moreover, we show that the analysis of pro-
tein domains yields meaningful functional signatures that allow
the distinction between driver and passenger gene fusions.

Pipeline for classification of gene fusions

 

Another important difference is that our pipeline takes into
account expression data, as changes in the expression of partner
genes are common in gene fusions (Rabbitts, 1994). Notably,
among the top 60 genes identiﬁed by Wang et al as those
more likely to undergo a fusion, there is a 13-fold enrichment
for CGC proto-oncogenes not reported to be involved in trans-
locations, whereas proto—oncogenes present in Mitelman data-
base (i.e. involved in translocations) are enriched only 10-fold.
This suggests that their predictions (some of which have been
validated experimentally) are biased towards known oncogenes,
whether involved in fusions or not. Although our approach
might also be affected by this bias in favor of known oncogenes
(50% of CGC oncogenes are predicted to be ‘driver’, Fig. 2), we
have tried to minimize this problem by including features that are
retained or lost as a result of the fusion; therefore, the predictive
accuracy of our pipeline should be even better.

Even though these results support a robust behavior of the
classiﬁer, we set out to validate it in various ways using results
from several independent datasets containing several thousand
fusions reported in recent NGS and EST/mRNA studies. We
found that they were moderately but signiﬁcantly enriched in
predicted ‘driver’ fusions, whereas only a small number of false
positives were found among chimeric transcripts identiﬁed in
normal cells. Likewise, those datasets with more conﬁdent gene
fusion predictions showed a higher percentage of fusions classi-
ﬁed as ‘driver’ by Oncofuse. Furthermore, pathway analysis
showed that fusions predicted to be ‘driver’ in these datasets
involve genes that participate in key oncogenic pathways. For
example, we found that many predicted ‘driver’ fusions could
lead to oncogenesis by disrupting normal cell adhesion, which
is one of the hallmarks of cancer (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000,
2011). This is an interesting ﬁnding, especially given the fact that
the datasets analyzed were obtained mostly from EPI tissues in
which this pathway plays a signiﬁcant role in carcinogenesis
(Martin-Belmonte and Perez-Moreno, 2012).

Finally, we were able to test the performance of Oncofuse in
new datasets that have been made available since its construction.
First, Oncofuse would have correctly classiﬁed 79% of the gene
fusions published in cancer samples in this period (until April
2013). Second, we tested the classiﬁer on the lists of candidates
detected by gene fusion detection algorithms in RNA-seq studies.
Although the real number of gene fusions with oncogenic proper-
ties in such datasets is unknown, because only a few candidates are
tested experimentally, fusions with support from published experi-
mental studies were given higher probabilities of being ‘driver’.

In summary, we present a robust Bayesian classiﬁer supported
by extensive validation studies. We believe that Oncofuse could
become a useful computational tool to aid in the prediction of
the oncogenic potential of novel fusion genes detected by NGS in
the transcriptomes of cancer samples. In this way, it should help
to prioritize which candidates should be tested experimentally
and thus speed up the identiﬁcation of novel fusion genes with
a relevant role in the diagnosis, classiﬁcation and treatment of
cancer patients.

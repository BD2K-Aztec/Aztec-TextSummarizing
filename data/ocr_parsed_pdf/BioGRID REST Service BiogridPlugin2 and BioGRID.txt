ABSTRACT

Summary: The Biological General Repository for Interaction
Datasets (BioGRID) representational state transfer (REST) service
allows full URL-based access to curated protein and genetic
interaction data at the BioGRlD database. Appending URL
parameters allows filtering of data by various attributes including
gene names and identifiers, PubMed ID and evidence type. We also
describe two visualization tools that interface with the REST service,
the BiogridPlugin2 for Cytoscape and the BioGRlD WebGraph.
Availability and implementation: BioGRlD data and applications
are completely free for commercial and non-commercial use.

1 INTRODUCTION

The aim of the Biological General Repository for Interaction
Datasets (BioGRID, http://thebiogrid.org) is to curate and distribute
comprehensive collections of physical and genetic interactions from
all major model organisms, including human (Breitkreutz et (11.,
2008; Reguly et (11., 2006). BioGRID currently houses 362 355
interactions, categorized by evidence code and supplemented with
annotation such as modiﬁcations and phenotypes. BioGRID data
are accessible through a searchable web interface, the Osprey
network visualization tool (Breitkreutz et (11., 2003) and partner
databases such as Saccharomyces Genome Database (Engel et (11.,
2010). Downloadable data ﬁles in tab-delimited or PSI-M125 XML
(Kerrien et (11., 2007) formats are available for off-line data analysis.
However, since these ﬁles are often large and/or complex, full
utilization of the data can require specialized scripts to be written.
From release 3.0.64 (May 2010), BioGRID has been made
available in MITAB format (Kerrien et (11., 2007), a tab-delimited
format, with BioGRID evidence codes mapped to PSI-MI ontology

terms. The PSICQUIC web service has been established by the IMEx
consortium (http://imex.sourceforge.net) providing federated access
to multiple interaction databases, including BioGRID, in MITAB
format (Orchard et (11., 2009). Although access via PSICQUIC
provides all available interactions in BioGRID, it is not ideal for
provision of BioGRID data as it does not contain original BioGRID
evidence codes, post-translational modiﬁcations, phenotypes or free-
text qualiﬁers. Here, we describe a new representational state
transfer (REST) web service allowing access to ﬁill BioGRID data,
and two visualization tools that programmatically access it. Example
use cases for all components are provided in Supplementary File 1.

2 BIOGRID REST SERVICE

BioGRID data have been made available through a REST-style
web service at a dedicated URL, http://webservice.thebiogrid
.org/resources/interactions, hereafter abbreviated to ‘rest_url’.
Parameters can be appended to the rest_url to ﬁlter the results
returned, for example, ‘rest_url/?searChNames=true&geneList
=mdm2|tp53&includeHeader=true’ will return all interactions
between any genes with ofﬁcial name ‘mdm2’ or ‘tp53’. Other
parameters allow ﬁltering by various identiﬁers, PubMed ID,
experimental evidence and other data-associated features. A ﬁill
list of parameters, help manual and a formal description in Web
Application Description Language (WADL) for the BioGRID REST
service are available.

In addition to BioGRID interaction data, interactions from the
IMEx databases: IntACt (Aranda et (11., 2010), MINT (Ceol et (11.,
2010) and DIP (Salwinski et (11., 2004) have been parsed, mapped to
BioGRID evidence codes according to established rules (http://wiki
.thebiogrid.org/doku.php/imex_import), and included as an option
for retrieval in the REST service data (including originating
database interaction identiﬁers), using the rest_url parameter
‘sourceDatabaseList’. IMEx interaction ﬁles are downloaded from
their respective web sites and integrated into the REST service to
coincide with each monthly BioGRID release, currently (December
2010) providing >300 000 additional interactions and >90 000 new
(i.e. not curated in BioGRID) non-redundant interactions. These
additional interactions are currently only available through the
BioGRID REST service.

3 BIOGRID PLUG|N2

Interaction data are often most intuitively viewed and manipulated
from within a graphical network visualization tool such as Cytoscape
(Shannon et (11., 2003) that has features that are continuously

enhanced by development of user-contributed plugins. Although
Cytoscape has several plugins that act as web service clients
allowing interactions to be imported from various sources across
the web, none provide easy import of ﬁill BioGRID data.
Osprey, another popular network visualization tool developed in
conjunction with BioGRID, represents interactions in a ﬂexible and
rapidly expandable graphical format, allows functional comparisons
between datasets and can retrieve data from the BioGRID database
across the Internet. However, Osprey does not currently have
an open source plugin-style architecture that enables users to
apply different ﬁinctions created by outside developers to network
analysis. We have developed an enhanced plugin for Cytoscape
called BioGRIDPlugin2 that can import data from the BioGRID
REST service to allow the complete functionality of Cytoscape and
its available plugins to be applied to BioGRID data. During import,
data can be ﬁltered according to various attributes such as gene
names and identiﬁers, PubMed IDs and evidence codes, via a user-
friendly custom ﬁlter dialog window (Fig. 1). Multiple ﬁlters can
be created and saved for later use. Other useful functions include
node expansion and export of ﬁltered networks allowing creation of
custom tab ﬁles based on the ﬁlters.

4 BIOGRID WEBGRAPH

BioGRID webgraph is a web application, which interacts with the
BioGRID REST service to provide simple gene network graphs for
user-provided gene lists. Graphs are created using scalable vector
graphics, and can be saved as XGMIVIL ﬁles for visualization in
Cytoscape.

5 IMPLEMENTATION

The BioGRID REST service is implemented in Java, runs on a
Redhat Linux 8 server, in Glassﬁsh Application Server 3.1 and

connects to a MYSQL 5 database running on a separate a Redhat
Linux 8 server. The Cytoscape plugin has been tested with Cytoscape
2.6 on Linux, MacOSX and Windows XP SP2. BioGRID webgraph
is written in PHPS and PEAR.

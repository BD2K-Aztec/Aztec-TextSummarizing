Bayesian approach for paired-end DNA

 

alignments a and b and T is the scale factor, by exponentiating
the scores, we arrive at:

pm, ma, 1,, I) (x 6(Stt/De(Sh/D_

Finally, letting A and B denote the set of all possible align—
ments of a and B to the reference, we can calculate the posterior
probability p(a|a, B) of a indicating the true genomic source of
the read as follows:

1
mmm=22mmmm

1:0 beB

‘ (mﬂahbmmhn (D
{21’—
b“”i2§h®ﬁm&%&un

1:0 aeA beB
Naturally, it is not feasible to exhaustively search A and B;
therefore, we approximate (l) by restricting A and B to be the set
of alignments that are produced by Last in Step 1.

2.3 Efﬁcient computation

To calculate the posterior probabilities eff1ciently, we use the
following intermediate values:

ea=ewe>

X 2%2617,

beB

ya = (1 — 0') Zebnmb),

beB
Zn 2 ea(x + ya), and

2:2 2,1.

aeA

Then Equation (1) can be rewritten as:

pwmm=ﬁ (a
Z

2.4 Accounting for alignment cut-off

Step 1 inevitably uses a cut—off: it returns alignments with score
3 5mm. This may lead to false—positive mappings.

For example, suppose we have a read pair that is truly con—
joint, where the ﬁrst read’s true alignment has score 2 5mm — l,
and the second read’s true alignment has score >> 5min. Suppose
the ﬁrst read has a random alignment with score 2 5mm. Our
probabilistic method will conf1dently predict an incorrect
mapping.

To solve this problem, we modify our probabilistic method
slightly. We assume an unlucky case: the first read has an align—
ment with score 2 5mm — l, at the optimal distance from the best
alignment of the second read (as we use integer scores, 5min — l is
the highest possible score <smin). Let Smax be the maximum score
of any alignment in B and 11mx be the maximum value of n(f) for
any f. We modify Equation (2) as:

Za
p(alw,ﬂ) — 2+ W,

 

where

W : e<<smm71>/T>e<smaxm(1 _ (mm

2.5 The case where |B| = 0

The preceding calculations do not work when |B| = 0. In this
case, we define the result to be the same as if there was one
alignment in B on a different chromosome to any alignment in A.

 

(1

2 = 22,,

3 PERFORMANCE TESTING

In this section, we compare the results of testing our method with
those of other mapping tools that provide a paired—end option.
We tested the following: Novoalign, Stampy, BWA, Bowtie,
GSNAP and SOAP. Although the list is not comprehensive,
the tools chosen are representative of the different paired—end
mapping strategies discussed in Section 1 that have been used
so far to deal with paired—end reads. Obviously the performance
is also hugely affected by how individual reads are mapped be—
cause this phase precedes the pairing phase for most aligners.
With our selection of mapping tools, we have also attempted
to cover a wide range of techniques that are used for mapping
individual reads. BWA, Bowtie and SOAP use the Burrowsi
Wheeler transform to index the reference, whereas Novoalign,
Stampy and GSNAP use hash—bashed techniques. BWA, SOAP
and GSNAP search for semi—global alignments that contain no
more than a certain user—specified number of mismatches and
gaps, whereas Stampy and Novoalign follow the traditional
seed—and—extend technique with afﬁne gap penalties. Newer ver—
sions of Bowtie and BWA can perform both semi—global, as well
as local alignments. The version information of each aligner is
provided in the Supplementary Material.

We conducted a series of tests that cover a variety of practical
scenarios, such as when the reference is incomplete, when the
sample lacks a reference and has to be mapped to the reference
of a close species or when there are large variations between the
reference and the sample that have the effect of confounding the
pairing relation.

Our results, which we describe later in the text, show that Last
provides a good combination of sensitivity, error rate and com—
putation time and is consistently among the top performers in all
of the tests. However, we realize that each aligner comes with
numerous parameter settings that provide a trade—off among
sensitivity, error rate and time, and it is difﬁcult to judge per—
formance based on a single set of parameters. Here, we have tried
to show the aligners in the best light possible. For most aligners,
we report the best results after having tried various parameter
settings, details of which can be found in the Supplementary
Material. With Last, we use the same settings throughout all
the tests so as to avoid deliberate optimization to ﬁt the data.

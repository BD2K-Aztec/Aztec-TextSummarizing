Many large omics datasets have been published and many more are expected in the near future. New analysis methods are needed for best exploitation. We have developed a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy data analysis. Our discovery of all significant substructures (DASS) approach elucidates the underlying modularity, a typical feature of complex biological data. It is related to bi clustering and other data mining approaches. Importantly, dass gui also allows handling of multi-sets and calculation of statistical significances. dass gui contains tools for further analysis of the identified patterns: analysis of the pattern hierarchy, enrichment analysis, module validation, analysis of additional numerical data, easy handling of synonymous names, clustering, filtering and merging. Different export options allow easy usage of additional tools such as Cytoscape. Availability: Source code, pre-compiled binaries for different systems, a comprehensive tutorial, case studies and many additional datasets are freely available at

Motivation: Regulatory, non-coding RNAs often function by forming a duplex with other RNAs. It is therefore of interest to predict putative rna rna duplexes in silico on a genome wide scale. Current computational methods for predicting these interactions range from fast complementary based searches to those that take intramolecular binding into account. Together these methods constitute a trade-off between speed and accuracy, while leaving room for improvement within the context of genome wide screens. A fast pre filtering of pu-tative duplexes would therefore be desirable. Results: We present ri search an implementation of a simplified Turner energy model for fast computation of hybridization, which significantly reduces runtime while maintaining accuracy. Its time complexity for sequences of lengths m and n is Oðm Á nÞ with a much smaller pre-factor than other tools. We show that this energy model is an accurate approximation of the full energy model for near complementary rna rna duplexes. ri search uses a Smith– waterman like algorithm using a dinucleotide scoring matrix which approximates the Turner nearest neighbor energies. We show in benchmarks that we achieve a speed improvement of at least 2.4Â compared with rna plex the currently fastest method for searching near complementary regions. ri search shows a prediction accuracy similar to rna plex on two datasets of known bacterial short RNA srna messenger RNA (mRNA) and eukaryotic microRNA (miRNA)– mRNA interactions. Using ri search as a pre-filter in genome wide screens reduces the number of binding site candidates reported by miRNA target prediction programs, such as target scans and miRanda, by up to 70%. Likewise, substantial filtering was performed on bacterial rna rna interaction data.

introduction noncoding RNA (ncRNA) form an abundant class of genes involved in both regulation and housekeeping functions, often in complexes with proteins and or through interactions with other RNAs (). The potential for nc rnas is becoming apparent, e.g. in the mammalian genome where the protein coding regions account for $1.2% (International Human Genome Sequencing) while the majority of the genome is transcribed (). Even in smaller genomes, such as fungi strains of Aspergillus, 'only' 4550% of the genome encodes proteins (), leaving plenty of room for nc rnas which could hold the potential for improvements to microbial industrial production, such as has already been investigated in Streptomyces (D'). Also in mammalian production systems such as Chinese hamster ovary cell lines, nc rnas receive increasing attention (). Computational screens for structured RNAs result in thousands of candidates on a genome wide scale and it is of interest to predict possible RNA interaction partners of these sequences (). These candidates are predicted from sequence and structure based alignments, by using a combination of thermodynamic and evolutionary constraints (such as compensating base pair changes) (). A principal problem, however, is to obtain experimental data for each of these candidates, such as the full length RNA sequence and its function. Another factor is that many nc rnas are expressed at extremely low levels. For example, the regulatory antisense RNA of the GAL10 operon in yeast is functional and expressed as one copy per 14 cells (). Coping with such low expressed nc rnas on a high throughput experimental scale is still an intractable task. One approach toward functional analysis of ncRNA candidates is to search for possible interactions with other RNAs, as a substantial class of nc rnas function by duplex formation with other RNAs, of which microRNAs (miRNAs) are a popular example. However, not only small nc rnas interact by base pairing, but also long nc rnas. For example, st auf en 1 mediated messenger RNA decay (SMD) can be initiated by imperfect base pairing between Alu elements in a l ncrna and in the 3 0-UTR of an SMD target (). Translational regulation by short RNAs srn as is also a common mechanism existing in bacteria (). A well known example is the micco mpc messenger RNA (mRNA) interaction causing translational repression (). *To whom correspondence should be addressed.  The Author(s) 2012.

discussion ri search is a fast method to search for near complementary base pairing in genomic sequence by using a simplified energy model. In a runtime benchmark, we show that ri search is at a minimum a factor of 2.4 faster than rna plex the currently fastest method for predicting near complementary duplexes and also has a lower memory consumption. Remarkably, our simplified model gives good energy estimates for complementary duplexes interspersed with small bulges and interior loops. Even though ri search systematically computes an energy differing by a small factor compared with the full Turner energy model, the reported energies strongly correlate (r  0.99) with the energies computed by the full model in duplex fold. When ranking random duplexes by their predicted energies, ri search shows on average an overlap of 94% with duplex fold and rna plex within the highest ranking duplexes. In our evaluation of prediction accuracy on the sRNA mRNA and mirna mrna datasets, we show that ri search achieves a similar or better sensitivity and precision for predicted base pairs as other compared methods. However, considering the accessibility of binding sites with rna plex can increase the recovery rate of the verified srna mrna interactions. Other approaches, such as in tarn a and rna up also account for accessibility by computing intramolecular base pair probabilities in both sequences. This, however, comes at the expense of runtime. In contrast, the objective of ri search is the fast search for potential rna rna duplexes. One application is pre filtering in genome wide screens. When ri search is used as a pre-filter for specialized miRNA target predictors, such as miRanda and target scans the number of target site candidates can be significantly reduced, which in turn results in a better precision of the miRNA target prediction. Problems with developing methods that should be applied on a genome wide scale include reliable testing. We face a lack of experimentally verified interactions. For many miRNAs for example, target genes have been identified, but the actual binding site positions within their 3 0-UTR are unknown (). Even for known target sites, the extent of the interactions is not clear, for examples of bacterial sRNA target sites, see. Even though we could benchmark on a limited dataset, benchmarking the accuracy of genome wide searches for rna rna interactions is currently hard given the limited amount of known interactions. In particular, it is not possible to reliably calculate the false discovery rate unless follow-up experiments are carried out. Another factor is the estimation of p values which requires a background model for rna rna interaction to distinguish true positives from random hits. This, however, depends on incorporating reliable shuffling schemes, e.g. based on dinucleotide composition, similar to those for de novo prediction of ncRNA genes ().Column 1: HGNC [HUGO (Human Genome Organization) Gene Nomenclature Committee] symbol, column 2: miRNA ID (all human), columns 35: Results shown for each of the tools include the G kcal mol of the interaction, its rank (r) within all predictions and the deviation of the predicted target position pred from the reported one lit (p) with p  j begin pred  begin lit j j end pred  endl it j.

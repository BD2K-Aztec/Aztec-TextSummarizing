With the rapidly expanding availability of data from personal genomes, exo mes and transcriptome s medical researchers will frequently need to test whether observed genomic variants are novel or known. This task requires downloading and handling large and diverse datasets from a variety of sources, and processing them with bioinformatics tools and pipelines. Alternatively, researchers can upload data to online tools, which may conflict with privacy requirements. We present here Kaviar, a tool that greatly simplifies the assessment of novel variants. Kaviar includes: (i) an integrated and growing database of genomic variation from diverse sources, including over 55 million variants from personal genomes, family genomes, transcriptome s SNV databases and population surveys; and (ii) software for querying the database efficiently. Availability: Kaviar is programmed in Perl and offered free of charge as Open Source Software. Kaviar may be used online as a programmatic web service or downloaded for local use from http://db.systemsbiology.net/kaviar. The database is also provided.

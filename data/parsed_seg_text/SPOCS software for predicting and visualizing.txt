At the rate that prokaryotic genomes can now be generated , comparative genomics studies require a flexible method for quickly and accurately predicting orthologs among the rapidly changing set of genomes available. s pocs implements a graph based ortholog prediction method to generate a simple tab delimited table of orthologs and in addition, html files that provide a visualization of the predicted ortholog paralog relationships to which gene protein expression metadata may be overlaid.

introduction the prediction of orthologs and paralogs is a fundamental step in many comparative genomics studies. For example, orthology and paralogy relationships are used to identify the core and auxiliary genes among related organisms, assign protein function annotation to genes in a new genome and predict gene expansion events, such as those that give rise to protein families. Though the concepts of orthology and paralogy were defined many years ago, the advent of whole genome sequencing and the wide availability of these genomic data has been the catalyst for the development of numerous ortholog prediction programs for a recent review]. In large parts, these programs rely on the identification of homologous genes/ proteins, and frequently employ BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool;) to identify these. Many methods have focused on eukaryotic genomes, in which widespread gene duplication and domain rearrangement have made predicting orthologs particularly challenging (). In prokaryotes, however, the challenge lies in keeping up with the rate of genomic data generation. As a bacterial genome can now be sequenced in a day or two, and many are often left in 'high quality draft' stage, comparative genomics studies on these data require the flexibility to quickly and accurately predict orthologs on the fly when the genome data are updated frequently. We have previously employed a graph based ortholog paralog prediction method (), that combines the pairwise (two species) predictions from in paranoid (), using custom Perl scripts to produce orthologs for groups of species. Here, we present a robust software tool called s pocs (Species Paralogy and Orthology Clique Solver) that implements this approach, providing flexible and readily extensible ortholog predictions for groups of species defined by the user.

application provided a set of n proteomes fast a formatted files of the predicted proteins from a species) and an optional proteome to serve as the out group s pocs proceeds through three main stages. First, s pocs executes a series of BLAST () runs between every pair of species to identify reciprocal best hits; this is the most compute intensive stage, requiring n 2 independent BLAST runs. When s pocs is run locally, the BLAST results are stored in the scratch directory, allowing subsequent s pocs runs that include some of the same n species to avoid performing BLAST runs if they already exist. In the second stage, s pocs uses the BLAST results to generate an orthology paralogy relationship graph based on merging the pairwise ortholog and in-paralog relationships [as defined by. Finally, s pocs identifies cliques in each graph by breaking it into subgraphs and using the branch and bound clique finding algorithm () to iteratively find all cliques in each subgraph. We classify the graphs into four subjective categories: Complete, semi complete Incomplete and Degenerate. The Complete graphs include no more than one protein per species and every protein (node in the graph) is connected to every other protein by a reciprocal best hit (edge), i.e., a maximum clique. semi complete graphs may be reported in which no more than one protein per species is present but with less than the maximal number of edges (this is a tunable parameter for which the default is 5%). By definition, these Complete and semi complete cliques are the result of single unique graphs that resolve to single unique cliques. The Incomplete graphs have no more than one protein per species, and less than the maximal number of edges (more missing edges than specified for semi complete. The Degenerate graphs have more than one protein (node) from one or more of the species. For the Incomplete and Degenerate graphs, the clique finding algorithm will identify as many maximum cliques as possible.

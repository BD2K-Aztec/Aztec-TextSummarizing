The gwa toolbox is an R package that standardizes and accelerates the handling of data from genome wide association studies g was particularly in the context of large scale g was meta analyses. A key feature of gwa toolbox is its ability to perform quality control (QC) of any number of files in a matter of minutes. The implemented workflow has been structured to check three particular data quality aspects: (i) data formatting, (ii) quality of the g was results and (iii) data consistency across studies. Output consists of an extensive list of quality statistics and plots which allow inspection of individual files and between study comparison to identify systematic bias.

introduction meta analyses of genome wide association studies g was have proven to be powerful tools to uncover novel loci associated with a variety of complex traits (). Current g was meta analyses often involve large numbers of studies (from dozens to 100 in large collaborative efforts such as those based on the metabo chip. Typically, each study provides summary statistics on the association between the study phenotype and 2.5 to 37 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), depending on whether HapMap or 1000 Genomes Project data are used as reference sets. As a result, analysts dealing with g was meta analyses need to process many files each of size 200 Mb, even when only minimal information is shared. Given that g was involved in such meta analyses may differ by study design, population structure, data management and statistical methods, the assessment of post g was data quality is important to uncover study specific problems. Available meta analysis software, such as METAL (), PLINK () and gw am a () address some of these issues (e.g. p value inflation, SNP filtering) during the meta analysis * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

However, these tools perform only basic sanity checks before meta analyzing the data and do not allow extensive QC of g was result files (for an extensive comparison of popular tools, see Supplementary). Therefore, in depth QC and handling of g was result files are frequently performed using in house scripts. These scripts are often not very efficient in handling dozens of large files, and issues may be addressed in a non systematic way. In the absence of a rigorous and efficient QC, undetected bias at the individual study level can introduce spurious heterogeneity, which in turn can increase the false positive rate and decrease power of the meta analysis (). Here we introduce the gwa toolbox an R package that standardizes and accelerates the handling and QC of post g was data. Its purposes are to make data handling easier, to support a more systematic QC and to facilitate the inspection of data quality prior to use of the g was result files in a meta analysis (Supplementary).

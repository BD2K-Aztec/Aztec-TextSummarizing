Frozen robust multi array analysis frm a is a single array preprocessing algorithm that retains the advantages of multi array algorithms and removes certain batch effects by down weighting probes that have high between batch residual variance. Here, we extend the frm a algorithm to two new microarray platforms affymetrix Human Exon and Gene 1.0 st by modifying the frm a probe level model and extending the frm a package to work with oligo exon feature set and gene feature set objects. Availability and implementation: All packages are implemented in R. Source code and binaries are freely available through the Bioconductor project.

Motivation: bios am tools is a Ruby language interface to sam tools the highly popular library that provides utilities for manipulating high throughput sequence alignments in the Sequence alignment map format. Advances in Ruby, now allow us to improve the analysis capabilities and increase bios am tools utility, allowing users to accomplish a large amount of analysis using a very small amount of code. bios am tools can also be easily developed to include additional sam tools methods and hence stay current with the latest sam tools releases. Results: We have added new Ruby classes for the m pile up and Variant Call Format (VCF) data formats emitted by sam tools and introduced more analysis methods for variant analysis, including alternative allele calculation and allele frequency calling for SNPs. Our new implementation of bios am tools also ensures that all the functionality of the sam tools library is now supported and that bios am tools can be easily extended to include future changes in sam tools. bios am tools 2 also provides methods that allow the user to directly produce visualization of alignment data.

introduction many large scale genomics studies rely heavily on re-sequencing experiments in which genomes of individuals or populations are to be compared. Typically these experiments begin with shotgun sequencing of DNA using high throughput methods followed by alignment of the sequences to a reference genome assembly. Overdeveloped sam tools features and can produce publication quality visualizations of data with minimal effort by the coder. We previously described bios am tools () a Ruby language binding to the sam tools library and a bio gem of the BioRuby framework (). Since its release, bios am tools has been downloaded 25 000 times. sam tools is in constant development and hence there is a need to accommodate any future functionality of sam tools by facilitating extension of our software by other programmers.

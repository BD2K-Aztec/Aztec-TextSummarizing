Motivation: Despite the growing popularity in using CRISPR/Cas9 technology for genome editing and gene knockout, its performance still relies on well designed single guide RNAs sg rna. In this study, we propose a web application for the Design and Optimization crisp r do of guide sequences that target both coding and non-coding regions in spCas9 crisp r system across human, mouse, zebrafish, fly and worm genomes. crisp r do uses a computational sequence model to predict sg rna efficiency, and employs a specificity scoring function to evaluate the potential of off target effect. It also provides information on functional conservation of target sequences, as well as the overlaps with exons, putative regulatory sequences and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The web application has a user friendly genomeâ€“browser interface to facilitate the selection of the best target DNA sequences for experimental design. Availability and Implementation: crisp r do is available at

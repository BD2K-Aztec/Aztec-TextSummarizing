Motivation: do oss (Data Overlaid On Secondary Structures) is a tool for visualizing annotated secondary structures of large single stranded nucleotide sequences (such as full length virus genomes). The purpose of this tool is to assist investigators in evaluating the biological relevance of secondary structures within particular sequences. Availability and implementation: do oss is written in Java and is available from: http://dooss.

introduction large single stranded nucleotide sequences, such as cellular RNA molecules and single stranded DNA and RNA virus genomes, apparently form complex secondary structures through watson crick base pairing between bases on the same DNA/ RNA strand. Identified using either computational folding () or experimental techniques (), only a few of these structures have any known functional importance. Although techniques used to identify secondary structures typically give little or no information regarding the biological significance of identified structures, comparative structural and evolutionary analyses of related sequences can be illuminating in this regard (). Specifically, the evolutionary processes operating both to conserve these structures and to maintain the coding potential of the nucleic acid sequences from which they are composed, could potentially be used to identify structures with likely biological relevance (). do oss (Data Overlaid On Secondary Structures) permits visualization of individual secondary structures simultaneously annotated with large amounts of relevant data including, for example, gene locations, codon usage statistics, computational or biochemically determined nucleotide pairing probabilities, apparently co evolving nucleotide pairs and the degrees to which individual nucleotides, codons or base pairings are evolutionarily conserved. The intended purpose of such visualizations is ultimately to assist researchers in focusing the attention of their wet lab and computational research onto the computationally predicted or experimentally demonstrated nucleic acid secondary structures that are most likely to have some unknown biological relevance.

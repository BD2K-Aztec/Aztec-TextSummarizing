Analysis of the composition of heterogeneous tissue has been greatly enabled by recent developments in single cell transcript omics. We present s cell an integrated software tool for quality filtering, normalization, feature selection, iterative dimensionality reduction, clustering and the estimation of gene expression gradients from large ensembles of single cell rnase q datasets. s cell is open source, and implemented with an intuitive graphical interface. Scripts and protocols for the high throughput pre-processing of large ensembles of single cell rnase q datasets are provided as an additional resource. Availability and Implementation: Binary executables for Windows, MacOS and Linux are available at

introduction single cell sequencing enables heterogeneity assessments at unprecedented resolution. At a cost comparable to sequencing a sample in bulk, hundreds of single cell datasets can instead be generated. We present s cell a software tool to perform outlier filtering, to normalize cell cycle effects, to select genes for dimensionality reduction and to estimate inter sample expression gradients. Several groups have proposed reconstructing the gene expression kinetics of developmental processes from transcript omics data, by summarizing gene expression along the backbone of a spanning graph of the samples' pc a coordinates (). As single cell sequencing becomes more widely adopted, the large number of available samples makes direct regression of gene expression on pc a coordinates an attractive alternative. s cell can regress interpolate gene expression on pc a space, visualize expression gradients, and estimate expression kinetics along minimum spanning trees and minimum weight paths. These tools are accessible through an interactive, graphical interface.

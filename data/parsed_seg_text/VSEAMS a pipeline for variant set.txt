Motivation: genome wide association studies g was have identified many loci implicated in disease susceptibility. Integration of g was summary statistics p values and functional genomic datasets should help to elucidate mechanisms. Results: We extended a non-parametric SNP set enrichment method to test for enrichment of g was signals in functionally defined loci to a situation where only g was p values are available. The approach is implemented in v seams a freely available software pipeline. We use v seams to identify enrichment of type 1 diabetes (T1D) g was associations near genes that are targets for the transcription factors IKZF3, BATF and esr ra. IKZF3 lies in a known T1D susceptibility region, while BATF and esr ra overlap other immune disease susceptibility regions, validating our approach and suggesting novel avenues of research for T1D. Availability and implementation: v seams is available for download

introduction genome wide association studies g was have been successful in identifying loci associated with many phenotypes (), and summary statistics in the form of a list of single, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) p values for each marker tested are increasingly becoming available in the public domain (). In tandem with this, large amounts of functional genomic data across a wide variety of tissues and conditions are increasingly available through public repositories. Integrative methods that combine genome wide genetic and genomic data have the potential to highlight functional genomic categories suitable for further study in relation to a given phenotype. This is particularly important in type 1 diabetes (T1D) where of the 49 susceptibility loci currently described (http://immunobase.org, accessed), only 12 are consistent with a non-synonymous coding SNP as the causal variant. This is in accord with previous research (), and indicates a central role for gene regulatory SNPs in the modulation of complex disease, where integrative methods have utility. One such integrative approach is to modify gene set enrichment analyses methods g sea developed for microarray pathway analysis () for use with g was study datasets (). These approaches partner SNPs to genes based on public annotations and then test for differences in evidence of association between SNPs assigned to two sets of genes. There are several limitations with existing approaches. First, most methods require access to raw genotype data to correct for inter snp correlation due to linkage disequilibrium (LD). Raw genotype data are typically not available in the public domain, and this problem is compounded for meta analysis based g was which combines multiple datasets. Second, the permutation based approaches usually used to adjust for correlation are computationally expensive. Finally, classical gene set enrichment analysis is typically based on tests derived from the kolmogorov smirnov which is under powered. A need for simpler and more powerful methods has been identified (), but the proposed alternative, a t test has been criticized because it can not cope with strong correlation between genes (). We have previously used a wilcoxon based g sea method to demonstrate enrichment for T1D association to a gene network driven by the transcription factor IRF7 (). The Wilcoxon test was used as a more powerful alternative to a kolmogorov smirnov test, but the approach still required permutation to correct for the effects of LD. In this article, we describe an approximate method, that allows such tests to be performed with greater computational efficiency and, crucially, without access to raw genotype data, by extending an approach by. We implement this extended approach in a freely available software pipeline v seams. Although we have chosen the Wilcoxon test, the pipeline would be easily adaptable to any test of location such as a t test. Given previous evidence for the involvement of a network of genes linked to the transcription factor IRF7 (in (T1D), we hypothesized that networks of genes dependent on *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

We used v seams to test for enrichment of T1D association among the targets of 59 transcription factors identified through knock-down experiments in lymphoblastoid cell lines ().

discussion correlation is a problem for all enrichment analyses because it results in inflated test statistics compared with their theoretical. This problem exists in g sea of gene expression datasets, but is more pronounced for SNP data, in which historical recombination events produce LD patterns that are both complex and strong. The original g sea method accounts for this correlation by permuting phenotypes and repeating the entire gene expression analysis multiple times (), an approach we also took in a previous variant set enrichment analysis (). This computationally intensive approach seems required because permuting SNPs or genes directly destroys the correlation structure. Tests have been adapted for gene set enrichment that deal theoretically with the inflation of variance by estimating an average variance inflation factor (), but for SNPs, we do not believe a single variance inflation factor can capture the strength and highly variable correlation observed. Instead, in v seams we adapt a multivariate normal sampling approach, which we show is not only faster than phenotype permutation, but can be applied in the typical case where raw genotype data are not available. Our analyses indicate that the exact number of simulations required for a stable approximation of V* is specific to a gene set, but suggest that 5000 permutations is sufficient for the g was data we consider here. v seams is designed not to require raw genotype data, and alternative methods to confirm sufficiency of simulation could be adopted from those developed in the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) literature (). Although this framework could equally be applied to parametric tests such as t tests we chose to concentrate on a non-parametric (Wilcoxon) test because it is more robust to occasional genotyping errors that may arise and that, without access to genotyping data, are impossible to check. Although the selection of test sets is often straightforward, the selection of appropriate control sets tends not to be and requires careful understanding of the competitive hypothesis tested in enrichment studies and consideration of the appropriate control set. Here, we restricted our set of control genes to genes that were perturbed by at least one transcription factor in the lymphoblastoid cell line knock-down experiments (). We encourage users to think carefully about the construction of control gene sets; for example, for microarray derived sets, we advocate matching on mean gene expression and coefficient of variation. All three transcription factors we identify from have been previously implicated in autoimmunity when cross referenced with data from immuno base (http:// immuno base org accessed April 3, 2014), providing validation of the method. IKZF3 is a transcription factor located within a T1D susceptibility locus at 17q12 () and overlaps susceptibility loci for ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, primary bill iary cirrhosis and rheumatoid arthritis (). IKZF3 is implicated in the regulation of B cell lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation (). BATF overlaps rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis susceptibility loci at 14q24.3 (). Mice over expressing Batf show impaired t cell development in vitro and no induction of IL-2 (). esr ra overlaps alopecia are ate Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis loci at 11q13.1 () and is a metabolic regulator of t cell activation and differentiation (). Future work will determine whether the enrichment pattern observed with T1D is shared with, or distinct from, other autoimmune traits. The set of genes perturbed when IRF7 is knocked down shows no evidence for enrichment, in contrast to our previous work (). This likely reflects that the transcription factor experiments were performed in a lymphoblastoid cell line. The master regulator of the IRF7 network previously described is GPR183, and is known to be activated by exposure to epstein barr virus; therefore, IRF7 responsiveness is likely to be altered in LCLs, which emphasizes a need for transcription factor function to be studied in primary cells. Imprecise knowledge of regulatory variants for individual genes hampers any test of variant set enrichment. As regulatory variation may lie 200 kb from a gene (), we use a large window to assign SNPs to genes. This increases the likelihood of overlapping regions occurring in test and control sets. We have implemented a random assignment strategy to mitigate this, and, although unbiased, this approach can result in a loss of power in the test for enrichment. Combination of chromatin state annotation with high throughput chromatin conformation capture ('Hi-C') has the potential to allow better definition of genomic regions involved in regulating specific genes. This increased resolution will require a corresponding increase in g was resolution through the use of imputation. Additionally, as regulatory function varies in a cell specific manner, annotation of multiple primary cell types and careful consideration of the biologically relevant cell types will be required. However, we expect this more precise definition of functional SNP sets will allow a sharp increase in the power of variant set enrichment analyses, and this will allow v seams analyses to interpret functionally defined genetic regions by linking them to end-point phenotypes.

Computational gene function prediction can serve to focus experimental resources on high priority experimental tasks. func base is a web resource for viewing quantitative machine learning based gene function annotations. Quantitative annotations of genes, including fungal and mammalian genes, with Gene Ontology terms are accompanied by a community feedback system.

introduction computational prediction eg. of gene function, gene phenotype, protein interactions or genetic interactions offers a statistically sound form of triage for reducing experimental tasks that would be prohibitive otherwise. For example, in genetic disease mapping, a candidate gene approach can reduce the study size required to establish significance. This is critically important, since large association studies are costly and may be infeasible for rare diseases. Functions are commonly represented by Gene Ontology (GO;) terms, which encompass molecular functions, cellular locations and biological processes. Experimentalists differ in their requirements for function prediction. To maximize new discoveries, some will wish to cast a wide net that may include many false positives. Others, for whom follow-up experiments are more resource intensive will wish to proceed conservatively. Therefore, func base displays quantitative confidence measures by which predictions may be ranked. Because users typically have additional domain knowledge that they can draw upon to filter out unlikely predictions, func base shows predictions in the context of underlying evidence. func base currently displays function annotations for several species. For each species, annotations are based on machine learning algorithms applied to an integrated data collection including protein motif annotation, phenotype and disease association, phylogenetic profiles, protein interactions and gene expression.

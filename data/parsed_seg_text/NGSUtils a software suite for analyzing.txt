ngs utils is a suite of software tools for manipulating data common to next generation sequencing experiments, such as fast q BED and BAM format files. These tools provide a stable and modular platform for data management and analysis. Availability and implementation: ngs utils is available under a BSD license and works on Mac OS X and Linux systems. Python 2.6Ã¾ and virtual env are required. More information and source code may be obtained from the website: http://ngsutils.org.

introduction with the broad implementation of next generation sequencing (NGS) technology in biomedical research, genomics sequencing data are generated at an unprecedented rate. Such advances bring enormous challenges in data analysis, of which efficient, standardized and consistent analysis are critical. With the deluge of data brought about by these technological advances, the time required to analyze NGS datasets has become the limiting factor in high throughput experiments (). In most cases, NGS data processing involves manipulating, converting and processing large standardized files, such as fast q (), BED () and BAM () files. Frequently, initial pre-processing is required before using these files as input to mapping for assembly purposes. Once reads have been mapped, post-processing of these files is typically applied to filter out noisy mappings or calculate summary information. The analysis of NGS experiments frequently consists of writing custom one off scripts to manipulate data or calculate final results. This approach is inefficient and can lead to reproducibility errors. There are some existing tools that aid in the analysis of NGS data, such as bed tools (), vcf tools (), sam tools () and the fast x toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/). To help augment the functionality of exiting tools and allow for pipeline assembly, the ngs utils suite was developed, covering different aspects of NGS data analysis, including preprocessing, post-processing, filtering, format conversion and final result calculations.

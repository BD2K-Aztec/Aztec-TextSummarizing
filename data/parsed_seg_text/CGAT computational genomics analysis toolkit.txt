Computational genomics seeks to draw biological inferences from genomic datasets, often by integrating and contextualizing next generation sequencing data. CGAT provides an extensive suite of tools designed to assist in the analysis of genome scale data from a range of standard file formats. The toolkit enables filtering, comparison , conversion, summarization and annotation of genomic intervals, gene sets and sequences. The tools can both be run from the Unix command line and installed into visual workflow builders, such as Galaxy. Availability: The toolkit is freely available from

introduction a central task in computational genomics is to extract biologically meaningful summaries and annotations from short read sequences to facilitate both visualization and statistical analysis. Commonly, this process starts by mapping next generation sequencing (NGS) reads and quantitating their distribution in genomic features such as transcripts with expression level and transcription factor binding sites with peak scores. This initial contextualization phase is well supported by specialized tools such as top hat cufflinks () or MACS (). In a second phase, datasets are typically integrated to allow interpretation, asking, for example, how many transcription factor binding sites are associated with each of exonic, intronic, flanking and intergenic genomic annotations. This phase necessarily relies on computational tools that can describe, integrate and summarize a variety of feature files produced from the initial phase and external annotation sources. Here we introduce a collection of tools that assist genomic scientists in successfully performing this crucial data integration and interpretation phase, bridging the gap from raw data to biologically interpretable results. We have made extensive use of these tools in a number of NGS projects ().

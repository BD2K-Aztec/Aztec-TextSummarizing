smash community is a stand-alone meta genomic annotation and analysis pipeline suitable for data from Sanger and 454 sequencing technologies. It supports state of the art software for essential meta genomic tasks such as assembly and gene prediction. It provides tools to estimate the quantitative phylogenetic and functional compositions of meta genomes to compare compositions of multiple meta genomes and to produce intuitive visual representations of such analyses. Availability: smash community source code and documentation are available at

introduction meta genomics allows the culture free characterization of natural and host associated microbial communities and provides an understanding of their structure, dynamics and functionality as well as the environmental factors that shape them (). Although the volume of meta genomic data being deposited to public repositories is increasing exponentially () and more large scale studies are underway (), there are still no standards for experimental and computational methods required to analyze such datasets (), making it hard to compare results from these studies. web servers such as CAMERA (), i mgm () and mgr ast () host published meta genomic datasets and enable users to perform additional and comparative analysis on them. However, there is an imminent need for stand-alone computational pipelines that enable in house analysis of new meta genomic datasets using standardized methods and comparison of datasets from different environments. mgr ast and the MEGAN stand-alone tool () perform functional and phylogenetic analyses of meta genomes. However, they do not estimate quantitative abundances as they simply count the reads mapping to known genes or species a measure strongly affected by gene length and genome size. They also do not assemble meta genomic reads and are thus unable to identify

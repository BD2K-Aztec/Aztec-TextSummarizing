The simulation experiment description markup language sed ml is a new community data standard to encode computational biology experiments in a computer readable XML format. Its widespread adoption will require the development of software support to work with sed ml files. Here, we describe a software tool, sed ed to view, edit, validate and annotate sed ml documents while shielding end users from the underlying XML representation. sed ed supports modellers who wish to create, understand and further develop a simulation description provided in sed ml format. Availability and implementation: sed ed is available as a standalone Java application, as an Eclipse plug-in and as an SBSI www sbsi edac uk plug-in, all under an MIT open source license.

introduction the simulation experiment description markup language sed ml () is an XML language that aims to describe computational biology experiments so that they may be reproduced and exchanged between different software tools. In brief, sed ml Level 1 encodes uniform time course simulation descriptions. It describes from where to obtain a model, the type of simulation to run and the content and presentation of the simulation output. sed ml is designed to be machine readable rather than human readable and to most modellers, sed ml should be largely hidden. However, there is a need for curators and sed ml document editors to easily view, annotate and validate sed ml files without being exposed to the underlying XML. sed ed is an application designed to address the needs of these users.

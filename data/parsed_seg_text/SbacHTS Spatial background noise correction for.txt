Motivation: high throughput cell based phenotypic screening has become an increasingly important technology for discovering new drug targets and assigning gene functions. Such experiments use hundreds of 96 well or 384 well plates, to cover whole genome RNAi collections and or chemical compound files, and often collect measurements that are sensitive to spatial background noise whose patterns can vary across individual plates. Correcting these position effects can substantially improve measurement accuracy and screening success. Result: We developed sbac hts (Spatial background noise correction for high throughput RNAi Screening) software for visualization, estimation and correction of spatial background noise in high throughput RNAi screens. sbac hts is supported on the Galaxy open source framework with a user friendly open access web interface. We find that sbac hts software can effectively detect and correct spatial background noise, increase signal to noise ratio and enhance statistical detection power in high throughput RNAi screening experiments.

introduction rnai is a process in which gene expression is inhibited by small RNA molecules such as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and short hairpin RNAs. high throughput RNAi screening is a breakthrough technology for functional genomics and for drug target discovery (). A frequently used screening platform uses 96 well or 384 well microtiter plates, on which each well contains siRNA oligos designed to target a specific gene. A number of methods and tools are available for data normalization (), visualization () and analysis of such experiments (). A challenge confronting the collection of precision measurements during high throughput Screening (HTS) is that the required experimental steps, such as procedures including cell culture, transfection, reagent delivery, incubation and hts plate scanning, may introduce spatially correlated background noise varying across experiments, batches and plates (). Ignoring position effects results in low signal to noise ratios and reduces sensitivity. Recently, edge effects have been considered in normalization of high throughput RNAi screening data (); however, the only existing approach to address the global spatial background noise across a plate is to use b score statistics () to adjust row and column effects using analysis of variance. This method can be an effective approach for simple row and column effects. In our exploratory analysis of the high throughput RNAi screening data, complex spatial patterns have been observed for most of the plates. Thus, simplified background correction approaches may often lead to over correction for some well plates and under correction for others. To help address this limitation, we sought advanced statistical models to enhance accuracy of quantification and correction of complex spatial background noise in high throughput RNAi screening experiments. Kriging interpolation () is a well established and widely used statistical model to fit spatial patterns in the observed data. In this study, we adapted a Kriging model to quantify and correct spatially correlated background noise in high throughput RNAi screening data and developed a user friendly software package, sbac hts (Spatial background noise correction for high throughput RNAi Screening), together with intuitive data visualization and quality assessment tools, for open source implementation of the Kriging correction. We find that sbac hts software can effectively detect and correct spatial background noise, increase signal to noise ratio and enhance statistical detection power for RNAi screening experiments.

We describe here the nc idp assign extension for the popular NMR assignment program SPARKY, which aids in the sequence specific resonance assignment of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). The assignment plugin greatly facilitates the effective matching of a set of connected resonances to the correct position in the sequence by making use of IDP random coil chemical shifts. Availability: The nc idp assign extension is available at http://www.protein-nmr.org/.

introduction the structural characterization of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) is a rapidly growing field in structural molecular biology. Over the past decade NMR spectroscopy has proven to be singular in its capacity to provide detailed structural characterization of these dynamic entities (). Although diverse experimental approaches have been developed (), the sequential resonance assignment of 10 kDa natively unfolded polypeptides is still not a trivial task. Here, we describe an enhanced version of the SPARKY () sequence repositioning extension, which assist in matching, connecting and assigning consecutive residues, and is specifically designed for intrinsically disordered proteins: nc idp assign neighbor corrected IDP chemical shift assignment). This tool makes use of a novel random coil chemical shift library, enabling the accurate prediction of the chemical shifts of a queried protein on a basis of tri peptides (). Predicted sequence specific chemical shifts are used as a template for reassignment and validation of existing resonance assignments. The newly designed nc idp assign greatly accelerates the process of sequential resonance assignment of large intrinsically disordered proteins by drastically reducing the level of assignment ambiguities.

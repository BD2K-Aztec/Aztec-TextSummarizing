The BioEnergy Science Center be sc is undertaking large experimental campaigns to understand the biosynthesis and biodegradation of biomass and to develop biofuel solutions. be sc is generating large volumes of diverse data, including genome sequences, omics data and assay results. The purpose of the be sc Knowledgebase is to serve as a centralized repository for experimentally generated data and to provide an integrated, interactive and user friendly analysis framework. The Portal makes available tools for visualization, integration and analysis of data either produced by be sc or obtained from external resources. Availability:

introduction the United States Department of Energy (DOE) initiative to increase the production of renewable biofuels such as cellulosic ethanol has led researchers to explore various biomass feedstocks and microbes for alternative fuel solutions (). The BioEnergy Science Center be sc was established by DOE in 2007 as a multi institutional partnership driving scientific efforts in this direction. be sc is undertaking large experimental campaigns to understand and mitigate the recalcitrance of biomass for cell ulo lytic degradation by enzymes and organisms, and to develop multitalented microbes for converting plant biomass into biofuels in a single step (). Researchers at be sc are focused on comprehensive and system level understanding of the process of biomass and plant cell wall formation, degradation and biofuel production. As such, the center is generating large volumes of diverse data including genome sequences, many types of

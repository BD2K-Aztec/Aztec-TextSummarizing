We introduce sharp visu an interactive open source software with a graphical user interface, which allows performing processing steps for localization data in an integrated manner. This includes common features and new tools such as correction of chromatic aberrations, drift correction based on iterative cross correlation calculations, selection of localization events, reconstruction of 2D and 3D datasets in different representations, estimation of resolution by Fourier ring correlation, clustering analysis based on Voronoi diagrams and Ripleys functions. sharp visu is optimized to work with event list tables exported from most popular localization software. We show applications of these on single and double labelled super resolution data.

introduction the first step in processing of stochastic super resolution microscopy data, the single molecule localization, recently became a routine operation () and is often implemented by the manufacturer with the software operating the microscope. However, the further processing workflow of single molecule localization microscopy s mlm data is much less standardized. Coordinates of individual molecules in space and time with their localization precisions are contained in a table of events obtained after fitting the gaussian like spots in the first step of the processing. Most available software for processing of single molecule data such as rapid storm (), quick palm (), the Localization Microscopy plugin for m manager (), RainSTORM () and) are dedicated to fitting of camera images (), while few software, such as palm siever () and ViSP (El) are designed for processing of localization tables. The best way to analyze stochastic microscopy data is to work directly with event lists () for which the development of new specialized and integrated tools is required.

Motivation: With the advent of relatively affordable high throughput technologies, DNA sequencing of cancers is now common practice in cancer research projects and will be increasingly used in clinical practice to inform diagnosis and treatment. Somatic cancer only single nucleotide variants sn vs are the simplest class of mutation, yet their identification in DNA sequencing data is confounded by germline poly-morphisms, tumour heterogeneity and sequencing and analysis errors. Four recently published algorithms for the detection of somatic SNV sites in matched cancer normal sequencing datasets are vars can somatic sniper joints nv mix and str elka. In this analysis, we apply these four SNV calling algorithms to cancer normal Illumina exo me sequencing of a chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patient. The candidate SNV sites returned by each algorithm are filtered to remove likely false positives, then characterized and compared to investigate the strengths and weaknesses of each SNV calling algorithm. Results: Comparing the candidate SNV sets returned by vars can somatic sniper joints nvmix2 and str elka revealed substantial differences with respect to the number and character of sites returned; the somatic probability scores assigned to the same sites; their susceptibility to various sources of noise; and their sensitivities to low allelic fraction candidates.

introduction cancer genome projects are currently working to catalogue the diversity of DNA mutations present in different cancers via high throughput DNA sequencing of matched cancer normal samples. These projects seek to find correlations between mutation profiles and clinical outcomes, identify mutations driving cancer progression and identify targets for novel therapeutic developments. Somatic single nucleotide variants sn vs are the simplest class of mutation, but their detection from matched cancer normal sequencing data is complicated by both biological and technical noise. Cancers arise from a single ancestral cell that has acquired enough somatic mutations to deregulate its own proliferation and expand into a large cell population with clonal mutations matching the ancestral profile. Loss of function in genes for genome stability and repair establishes a mutator phenotype in which a greater rate of somatic mutation provides the cell population with a vast repository of mutations in low copy. Those mutations conferring a selective advantage preferentially expand in number, forming subpopulations with the same sub clonal mutations. Clonal and sub clonal mutations include drivers of the cancer phenotype, and passenger mutations that arose in the same clonally expanding cell line as a driver (). Analysis of cancer sequencing data has unique challenges, including: methods for analysing matched cancer normal samples to distinguish germline polymorphism from somatic variation; genome rearrangements that do not align well to the reference; and cancer sample heterogeneity from sub clonal variation and sample impurity (). In addition to this biological complexity are several sources of mapping and sequencing error, both random and systematic. Error profile assessments of the Illumina sequencing platform have identified increased error rates at read ends, a tendency towards transversion base call errors, a low in del error rate and systematic sequence specific errors following inverted repeat sequences and GG motifs (). The majority of systematic errors assessed by only had base call errors on one of the two DNA strands. They suggested the presence of different motifs immediately preceding a certain site during sequencing on different strands leaves one strand significantly more prone to phasing error than the other. Greater depth of sequencing is often advanced as the solution to separating sequencing errors from real variation, but the susceptibility of particular sites to recurrent base call errors is consistently observed at any depth. Furthermore, increased depth has the unintended side effect of allowing sites with lower susceptibility to systematic error to accumulate multiple such mistakes.

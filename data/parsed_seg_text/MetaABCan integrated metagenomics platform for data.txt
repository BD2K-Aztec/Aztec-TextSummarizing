meta abc is a meta genomic platform that integrates several binning tools coupled with methods for removing artifacts, analyzing unassigned reads and controlling sampling biases. It allows users to arrive at a better interpretation via series of distinct combinations of analysis tools. After execution, meta abc provides outputs in various visual formats such as tables, pie and bar charts as well as clustering result diagrams. Availability: meta abc source code and documentation are available at

introduction meta genomics is a field that involves sampling, sequencing and analyzing the genetic material of un culturable microorganisms in microbial communities while maintaining their physiological conditions in habitats (). Large amounts of meta genomic datasets have been accumulated for analysis in these years through the rapid advancement of sequencing technology. One of the main focuses in meta genomics is the comparative study of meta genomes based on microbial compositions and diversities that are obtained by binning. Binning assigns sequences to phylogenetic groups according to their taxonomic origins (). Recently, many binning tools, such as MEGAN (), phy mm bl (), sort items () and disc rib in ate (), were developed to achieve higher binning accuracy. As the above binning methods become widely used, some data adjustment methods have lately been proposed to improve meta genomic data analysis. For example, it is known that 454 pyrosequencing produces artificial duplicated reads (), and indicated that removing

There are many programs that can read the secondary structure of an RNA molecule and draw a diagram, but hardly any that can cope with 10 3 bases. rna fdl is slow but capable of producing intersection free diagrams for ribosome sized structures, has a graph-ical user interface for adjustments and produces output in common formats. Availability and implementation: Source code is available under the GNU General Public License v3.0 at http://sourceforge.net/projects/ rna fdl for Linux and similar systems or Windows using MinGW. rna fdl is implemented in C, uses the Cairo 2D graphics library and offers both command line and graphical user interfaces.

introduction it might be a great simplification, but the most popular method to show RNA structure remains the classic radial base pair graph. We describe RNA force directed layout rna fdl whose strength is the ability to handle large molecules and to produce diagrams without intersections, without user intervention. This type of diagram is extremely regular with fixed distances between consecutive bases and between members of base pairs. Unpaired bases are placed on circle segments. The rules mean that diagrams are easy to interpret, but the rules can not be enforced on larger molecules. They invariably lead to intersecting lines. This means that programs either produce bad diagrams or bend the rules. na view () relaxes the rules for loop regions, with the consequence that loops may be distorted in size and shape, and larger structures are still not free of line intersections (data not shown treated the intersection problem with a backtracking method, but the code still can not draw a large ribosomal subunit (). A more recent program can draw large structures without intersections, but varies the distances between bases in loops (). There are no intersections, but the size of the loops may not reflect the number of bases. If automatic approaches fail, one may allow or even encourage manual intervention. VARNA and rna viz both use sophisticated methods for an initial layout, but rely on manual editing to get intersection free plots ().

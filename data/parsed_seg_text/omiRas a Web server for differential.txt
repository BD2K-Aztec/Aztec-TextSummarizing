Small RNA deep sequencing is widely used to characterize non-coding RNAs nc rnas differentially expressed between two conditions , e.g. healthy and diseased individuals and to reveal insights into molecular mechanisms underlying condition specific phenotypic traits. The ncrna ome is composed of a multitude of RNAs, such as transfer RNA, small nucleolar RNA and microRNA (miRNA), to name few. Here we present o miras a Web server for the annotation, comparison and visualization of interaction networks of nc rnas derived from next generation sequencing experiments of two different conditions. The Web tool allows the user to submit raw sequencing data and results are presented as: (i) static annotation results including length distribution, mapping statistics, alignments and quantification tables for each library as well as lists of differentially expressed nc rnas between conditions and (ii) an interactive network visualiza-tion of user selected miRNAs and their target genes based on the combination of several mirna mrna interaction databases. Availability and Implementation: The o miras Web server is implemented in Python, PostgreSQL, R and can be accessed at: http:// tools genx prone to miras

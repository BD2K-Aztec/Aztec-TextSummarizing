BFC is a free, fast and easy to use sequencing error correct or designed for Illumina short reads. It uses a non greedy algorithm but still maintains a speed comparable to implementations based on greedy methods. In evaluations on real data, BFC appears to correct more errors with fewer over corrections in comparison to existing tools. It particularly does well in suppressing systematic sequencing errors, which helps to improve the base accuracy of de novo assemblies. Availability and implementation: https://github.com/

introduction error correction is a process to fix sequencing errors on a sequence read by using other overlapping reads that do not contain the errors. Many de novo assemblers, in particular short read assemblers for large genomes, use error correction to reduce the complexity of the assembly graph such that the graph can be fitted to limited RAM. Error correction was first expressed as the spectral alignment problem (), whereby we take a set of trusted km ers and attempt to find a sequence with minimal corrections such that each km er on the corrected sequence is trusted. The majority of error correctors are based on this idea and take a greedy approach to solving this problem approximately. They make a correction based on the local sequence context and do not revert the decision. We worried that the greedy strategy might affect the accuracy given reads from a repeat rich diploid genome, so derived a new non greedy algorithm that explores larger search space in attempt to achieve higher accuracy.

Analysis of microbial genomes often requires the general organization and comparison of tens to thousands of genomes both from public repositories and unpublished sources. microbe db provides a foundation for such projects by the automation of downloading published, completed bacterial and archaeal genomes from key sources, parsing annotations of all genomes (both public and private) into a local database, and allowing interaction with the database through an easy to use programming interface. microbe db creates a simple to use, easy to maintain, centralized local resource for various large scale comparative genomic analyses and a back-end for future microbial application design.

introduction the study of bacterial and archaeal genomes has rapidly progressed from the analysis of single genomes to comparisons between hundreds and thousands. Any type of biological analyses or development of novel bioinformatic methods that uses more than a handful of genomes requires a basic but non-trivial method for obtaining, organizing and storing this genomic information. In the past, this has been a problem primarily limited to large scale data providers such as IMG (), NCBI (), GOLD () and CMR (). Although many of these centers provide genomic data in a variety of static formats such as Genbank and fast a these are often inadequate for complex queries. To carry out these analyses efficiently, a relational database such as MySQL (http://mysql.com) can be used to allow rapid querying across many genomes at once. Some existing data providers such as CMR allow downloading of their database files directly, but these databases are designed for large web based infrastructures and contain numerous tables that demand a steep learning curve. Also, addition of unpublished genomes to these databases is often not supported. A well known and widely used system is the Generic Model Organism Database (GMOD)

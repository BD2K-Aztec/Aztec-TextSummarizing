We introduce NOVA, a software for the analysis of complex ome profiling data. NOVA supports the investigation of the composition of complexes, cluster analysis of the experimental data, visual inspection and comparison of experiments and many other features. Availability and implementation: NOVA is licensed under the Artistic License 2.0. It is freely available at http://www.bioinformatik.uni-frankfurt.de. NOVA requires at least Java 7 and runs under Linux, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS.

introduction to facilitate diverse cellular functions, proteins can associate to form complex molecular machineries. complex ome profiling (CP,) uses blue native gel electrophoresis to separate intact proteins and protein complexes up to a molecular weight of 10 MDa () or even 60 MDa () using special large pore gels lp bne. After the separation, the gel strip is cut into 60 equally sized slices. Migration profiles are reconstructed by applying mass spectrometry lcms ms to identify the proteins contained in each slice. The relative abundance of each protein is calculated by label free lcms based quantification (). Through comparison of these profiles by hierarchical clustering, groups of co migrating proteins are recognized, indicating the composition of quaternary structures and functional complexes (). The method has been successfully applied to analyze mitochondrial complexes in rats () and humans () as well as to explore complex formation in plants and bacteria (). Typically, experimental datasets contain up to thousands of migration profiles, which can not be manually processed. Bioinformatic tools are needed to efficiently handle and visualize these data. Though several programs like Cluster 3.0 (), Java Treeview () or the multi experiment Viewer () have been applied, there is to the best of our knowledge no tool available that supplies all functionalities required for the visualization and evaluation of CP data.

Motivation: Pseudouridine (W), catalyzed by pseudouridine synthase (PUS), is the most abundant RNA modification and has important cellular functions. Developing an algorithm to identify W sites is an important work. And it is better if the algorithm could assign which PUS modifies the W sites. Here, we developed pp us (http://lyh.pkmu.cn/ppus/), the first web server to predict pus specific W sites. pp us employed support vector machine as the classifier and used nucleotides around W sites as the features. Currently, pp us could accurately predict new W sites for PUS1, PUS4 and PUS7 in yeast and PUS4 in human. pp us is well designed and friendly to user.

introduction pseudouridine (W), the most abundant RNA modification, has important cellular functions. For example, ablation of rRNA W modification by CBF5 deletion in S. cerevis ae is lethal (), and mutation of human PUS1 leads to mitochondrial myopathy and side rob lastic anemia (). Identifying W sites is certain an important work. W was known present in different categories of non-coding RNAs such as tRNAs, rRNAs and snRNA (). Recently, using newly developed w seq psi seq or pseudo seq methods, three works for the first time revealed that W is also present in mRNA (). W is catalyzed by pseudouridine synthase (PUS), and different W sites are catalyzed by different PUSs (). However, to our knowledge, there is only one tool developed for prediction of W sites in tRNA (). No tool is available to predict W sites in mRNA and other categories of RNAs, not mention predicting which PUS modifies the W sites. In this work, using pus specific W sites found in recent works (), we developed an algorithm to predict pus specific W sites. The algorithm could accurately predict W sites modified by PUS1, PUS4 and PUS7 in yeast and PUS4 in human. Any RNA sequence can be used as input. Finally, we implemented the algorithm in our web server pp us. pp us is well designed and friendly to user.

Motivation: Inferring global regulatory networks grn s from genome wide data is a computational challenge central to the field of systems biology. Although the primary data currently used to infer grn s consist of gene expression and proteomics measurements, there is a growing abundance of alternate data types that can reveal regulatory interactions, e.g. chip chip literature derived interactions, protein protein interactions. GRN inference requires the development of integrative methods capable of using these alternate data as priors on the GRN structure. Each source of structure priors has its unique biases and inherent potential errors; thus, GRN methods using these data must be robust to noisy inputs. Results: We developed two methods for incorporating structure priors into GRN inference. Both methods [Modified Elastic Net (MEN) and Bayesian Best Subset Regression (BBSR)] extend the previously described in fe relator framework, enabling the use of prior information. We test our methods on one synthetic and two bacterial datasets, and show that both MEN and BBSR infer accurate grn s even when the structure prior used has significant amounts of error (490% erroneous interactions). We find that BBSR outperforms MEN at inferring grn s from expression data and noisy structure priors.

introduction understanding how global regulatory networks grn s coordinate systems level response of a cell or organism to a new environmental state or perturbation is a key problem in systems biology, with applications spanning biofuels (), novel therapeutic targets () and the discovery of novel pathways involved in cellular differentiation (). The cellular response is governed by multiple regulatory mechanisms that can be encapsulated by large network models. Recent advances in the quality and availability of high throughput technologies enable measurement of different components of the GRN including mRNA transcript levels, protein levels, post-translational modifications, as well as DNA characteristics such as transcription factor binding regions and open chromatin locations (ENCODE Project). These multi-level and multi-scale datasets have made the inference of integrative grn s possible. As high throughput data capturing the abundance of mRNA transcripts are the most mature and readily available, many methods focus only on this single level of regulation, learning transcriptional regulatory networks. In transcriptional grn s the regulators are transcription factors (TFs, either previously known or predicted), and the targets are genes. time series data, capturing the temporal changes in transcript abundance, allow for the inference of the strength and direction of regulatory interactions, which can be used to predict how the system will be have under previously unmeasured conditions (). Here, we are primarily interested in methods for learning regulatory networks from compendia of expression data, and combining this data with complementary data sources that provide priors on network structure. Importantly, the priors we use in this work provide information about connectivity but do not provide any information about the relative strength, importance or dynamic properties of each known regulatory edge (these we atempt to learn from the data). Learning networks from single data types has severe limitations, as grn s operate on multiple levels in addition to the transcriptome; thus, alternate data types are needed to form a complete picture of cellular circuits. Even if one is interested in learning the purely transcriptional layer of a cell's regulatory network, many TFs are post transcriptionally modified in ways that confound single data-type network inference (the transcript abundance of a TF is not necessarily correlated with its protein abundance nor activity), and some regulatory sub circuits produce transcriptional output that is consistent with multiple models. One way to mitigate these pitfalls is to use publicly available sources of complementary data with bearing on regulation. We term any data that contains direct tf target information (either predicted, or experimentally validated) as structure priors. One source of such prior information is an ever growing collection of experimentally validated and manually curated databases of regulatory interactions. These databases are especially rich for *To whom correspondence should be addressed. y The authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the first two authors should be regarded as joint First Authors.

Additionally, the ENCODE Project Consortium (2012) (a high profile effort to build an encyclopedia of coding DNA elements) has generated a wealth of dna binding information that can be used to generate priors on mammalian regulatory network structure. These are only a few examples of an ever growing number of sources of GRN structure priors, and it can be seen that they differ substantially from organism to organism. Each source of prior information on GRN structure is an incomplete recapitulation of the underlying network, and may contain many incorrect or irrelevant interactions. Thus, incorporating structure priors into expression based GRN inference poses several interesting algorithmic challenges. Successful methods for integrative GRN inference must possess the following key properties: (i) The method must only include the part of the prior with support from the data. This is important, as the prior information typically is a collection of possible regulatory interactions, of which only a subset might be relevant in a given dataset. Also, this implies robustness to erroneous interactions in the prior, which can have various sources, such as non-functional TF binding reported by chips eq. (ii) Using a structure prior must not limit the ability to learn the part of the network for which no prior information exists. (iii) The user must be able to control the weight given to the prior. This feature allows the user to tune the method based on the believed completeness and accuracy of the prior, while respecting the first two properties over a wide range of parameters. In this work, we introduce two methods for incorporating structure priors that possess all three criteria.

discussion we developed two methods for incorporating prior knowledge into GRN inference. Both methods use the same underlying ODE model of regulation (see Section 2), but use different model selection approaches. MEN uses an adaptive weight on the penalty function to incorporate prior knowledge. BBSR uses the Bayesian formulation of linear regression, together with zellner s g prior to incorporate prior information, and best subset regression with the BIC for sparse model selection. A key difference between MEN and BBSR is how the choice of weight (how much influence to give to the prior) effects performance. Results presented in show that for BBSR higher values of g result in overall higher confidence in pk is and reduced confidence in all unknown interactions. As such, g can be interpreted as a confidence measure in the accuracy and completeness of pk is and be chosen accordingly. It is also possible to introduce multiple sources of prior information, each with a different weight (value of g). For MEN,. Performance change on the leave out set. pk is were sampled randomly from 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% of the GSIs in five repetitions. We define the leave out set as the set of GSIs that are not pk is. Here, we compare the a up r of the leave out set when using pk is (y-axis) to the a up r when not using pk is x axis. Points above the line indicate a performance increase when pk is are used the prior weight parameter exhibits a less predictable behaviour. Lower values of generally lead to higher confidence in pk is. However, for all datasets, we observed a performance peak around  0:01. This non-linear property could be the result of cross validation model selection procedure. We tested the performance of both methods on different subsets of the GSIs. We see that increasing the number of pk is increases performance in a linear manner for all datasets and both methods (Supplementary). This is in concordance with the results on the leave out set (the set of GSIs that are not pk is where both methods showed only minor performance change in the presence of pk is regardless of dataset or number of pk is used (). Finally, and most importantly for application to biological systems where only incomplete and noisy sets of pk is are available, we assessed the robustness of both methods to fp is. Both methods are robust to fp is and outperform the naive ranking scheme, which assigns high confidence to all pk is (). More specifically, for both large real datasets (E.coli and b subtilis both methods perform better than various baselines (no pk is with up to 10 fp is for each true prior interaction. This means that both methods, given sufficient genomic data, are able to act as filters to distinguish between true and false prior interactions. However, BBSR is slightly more robust to the presence of fp is. A key consideration for any practical application of network inference methods with prior information is the trade-off between re capitulating the prior, and discovering novel biology. Intuitively, as the degree of belief in the prior is increased (by increasing the weight of the prior information), more of the interactions in the prior will be ranked highly by the inference method. Thus, high weights can lead to the incorporation of false interactions in the case of inaccurate pk is (MEN more prone than BBSR), and impair performance on the leave out set (as seen in BBSR). We suggest to the reader to set the weight parameter for incorporating prior knowledge based on the expected completeness and accuracy of the pk is and, when in doubt, to choose a low weight.

The smart cyp server is the first web application for site of metabolism prediction of cytochrome p450 mediated drug metabolism. Availability: The smart cyp server is freely available for use on the web at www farm aku dk smart cyp where the smart cyp Java program and source code is also available for download.

introduction the most important drug metabolizing enzymes in humans are cytochromes P450 cyp s. They oxidize a wide range of substrates and contribute to the metabolism of 90% of all drugs (). While there are methods for site of metabolism prediction which are solely based on semi-empirical calculations of the substrates (), more accurate results should be achieved by explicitly including the reactivity of each site in a substrate. Hitherto, reactivity models for cyp s have been restricted to semi-empirical calculations of the stability of intermediates (). Later studies have shown that more accurate activation energies for cyp s can be computed by performing very time consuming density functional theory (DFT) transition state calculations on a he me group porphyrin ring model (). smart cyp however, presents the first solution for both fast and exact prediction of CYP reactivity. Accuracy of activation energies is ensured by making very extensive DFT calculations and speed is gained by saving these in a precalculated library so that they need only be looked up at execution. smart cyp has been validated for prediction of metabolism by the 3A4 isoform, which contributes to the metabolism of half of all drugs (). smart cyp has also been shown to work well for six other CYP isoforms (, b). In this application note, we describe the smart cyp server, the first web service for prediction of cyp mediated metabolism.

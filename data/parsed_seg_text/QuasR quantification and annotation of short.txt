qua sr is a package for the integrated analysis of high throughput sequencing data in R, covering all steps from read preprocessing, alignment and quality control to quantification. qua sr supports different experiment types (including rnase q chips eq and bis seq and analysis variants (e.g. paired end stranded, spliced and allele specific and is integrated in Bioconductor so that its output can be directly processed for statistical analysis and visualization. Availability and implementation: qua sr is implemented in R and C/Cþþ. Source code and binaries for major platforms (Linux, OS X and MS Windows) are available from Bioconductor www bioconductor org packages release bioc html qua sr html. The package includes a vignette with step by step examples for typical work flows.

introduction high throughput sequencing has become a powerful research tool in a wide range of applications, such as transcriptome profiling rnase q measurement of dna protein interactions or chromatin modifications chips eq and DNA methylation bis seq. In the last years, there have been many efforts to provide software in R/ Bioconductor () to simplify data processing and biological interpretation, such as an efficient framework for working with genomic ranges (), or tools for read alignment (), quality control () and statistical analysis (). It is however still challenging to conduct a complete analysis from raw data to a publishable result in the form of a single R script, which would greatly improve documentation and thus facilitate the exchange of analysis details with coworkers. Often it is necessary to perform a subset of tasks outside of R, for example on

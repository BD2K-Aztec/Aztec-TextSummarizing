Motivation: rnase q has become the method of choice to quantify genes and exons, discover novel transcripts and detect fusion genes. However, reliable variant identification from rnase q data remains challenging because of the complexities of the transcriptome, the challenges of accurately mapping exon boundary spanning reads and the bias introduced during the sequencing library preparation. Method: We developed rv boost a novel method specific for RNA variant prioritization. rv boost uses several attributes unique in the process of RNA library preparation, sequencing and rnase q data analyses. It uses a boosting method to train a model of good quality variants using common variants from HapMap, and prioritizes and calls the RNA variants based on the trained model. We packaged rv boost in a comprehensive workflow, which integrates tools of variant calling, annotation and filtering. Results: rv boost consistently outperforms the variant quality score recalibration from the Genome Analysis Tool Kit and the rnase q variant calling pipeline snp ir in 12 rnase q samples using ground truth variants from paired exo me sequencing data. Several rnase q specific attributes were identified as critical to differentiate true and false variants, including the distance of the variant positions to exon boundaries, and the percent of the reads supporting the variant in the first six base pairs. The latter identifies false variants introduced by the random hexamer priming during the library construction. Availability and implementation: The rv boost package is implemented to readily run in Mac or Linux environments.

introduction rnase q has become popular with the decreasing cost and its potential to quantify exon transcript levels over a large dynamic range, discover novel transcripts, identify various splicing mechanisms and detect fusion genes () (). However, while the variant identification from DNA sequencing is becoming a routine practice, the variant detection from rnase q remains challenging because of the complexity of the transcriptome, the ambiguities in mapping exon boundary spanning reads and the artifacts introduced in rnase q library protocols (). Because expressed genetic variants have more immediate impact on the protein function compared with the DNA variants, we were motivated to develop a reliable rnase q variant prioritization method. In general, variant detection from massive parallel sequencing data involves two steps. First is variant calling, which outputs all positions with any evidence of alternative alleles compared with reference. An essential next step is variant prioritization and filtering to obtain reliable variants of high confidence. For DNA sequencing data, the most widely used variant prioritization method is a mixture model based classifier, variant quality score recalibration v qsr within the Genome Analysis Toolkit g atk (). v qsr integrates multiple attributes annotations of the variants, all of which are based on features of sequencing, including the depth of coverage, strand bias, mapping qualities and variant position bias toward the end of the reads. v qsr uses variants reported in HapMap as the training source to calculate a filtering criterion, and then predicts true 'novel' variants. Another method snp ir proposes a series of arbitrary hard thresholds to filter and reduce the number of false variants (). After careful examination of the rnase q variant detection process, we proposed to include rna specific attributes annotations for the variant prioritization model in addition to the features included in g atk. Furthermore, we observed that the Gaussian mixture model and the parameter selection used in v qsr are not ideal for modeling these features and proposed to use a boosting method that uses generalized linear models as its base learners. This method, called the RNA Variant Boosting rv boost is a ranking machine to (a) train a model based on common variants in HapMap and (b) rank the variants accordingly. *To whom correspondence should be addressed. y The authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the first two authors should be regarded as Joint First Authors.

This workflow outputs called variants with detailed annotations in both the standard variant calling format (VCF) and the tab delimited text format. We have shown that rv boost outperforms v qsr in 12 rnase q samples with paired exo me sequencing data. We also introduced a key concept of train set quantile score', or the train q score, to help users determine their preferred precision recall trade-off.

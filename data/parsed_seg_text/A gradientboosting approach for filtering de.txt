Motivation: whole genome and exo me sequencing on parent offspring trios is a powerful approach to identifying disease associated genes by detecting de novo mutations in patients. Accurate detection of de novo mutations from sequencing data is a critical step in trio based genetic studies. Existing bioinformatic approaches usually yield high error rates due to sequencing artifacts and alignment issues, which may either miss true de novo mutations or call too many false ones, making downstream validation and analysis difficult. In particular , current approaches have much worse specificity than sensitivity, and developing effective filters to discriminate genuine from spurious de novo mutations remains an unsolved challenge. Results: In this article, we curated 59 sequence features in whole genome and exo me alignment context which are considered to be relevant to discriminating true de novo mutations from artifacts, and then employed a machine learning approach to classify candidates as true or false de novo mutations. Specifically, we built a classifier, named De Novo Mutation Filter dnm filter using gradient boosting as the classification algorithm. We built the training set using experimentally validated true and false de novo mutations as well as collected false de novo mutations from an in house large scale exo me sequencing project. We evaluated dnm filters theoretical performance and investigated relative importance of different sequence features on the classification accuracy. Finally, we applied dnm filter on our in house whole exo me trios and one CEU trio from the 1000 Genomes Project and found that dnm filter could be coupled with commonly used de novo mutation detection approaches as an effective filtering approach to significantly reduce false discovery rate without sacrificing sensitivity.

introduction de novo mutations dn ms represent the most extreme form of rare variants and play an important role in human diseases (). With rapid development of high throughput sequencing technology, large scale whole genome or exo me sequencing of parent offspring trios or multiplex families is becoming a powerful approach to investigating dn ms associated with human disease. Recent sequencing studies have revealed that dn ms can affect genes with diverse biological consequences in several neuropsychiatric diseases, such as autism spectrum disorder (), intellectual disability (), schizophrenia () and epileptic encephalopathies (). Here, we focus on a critical step in such studies, the detection of dn ms from whole genome exo me sequencing data in parent offspring trios. The standard approach used by most studies is to call variants in each sample of a trio independently and then identify putative dn ms by comparing offspring against parental genotypes with Mendelian inconsistency. Therefore, a false positive variant call in offspring or a false negative variant call in either parent will result in a false positive DNM call; conversely, a false negative variant call in offspring or a false positive variant call in either parent will result in a false negative DNM call. Although there have been great improvements in development of single and multiple sample variant calling approaches (), a variety of factors, including sequencing artifacts and alignment issues, lead to high rates of both false positive and false negative variant calls. Although allele frequency and linkage disequilibrium (LD) have been successfully leveraged to improve variant calling accuracy (), it can not apply to DNM calling because no such information is available for new mutations. Distinct from standard approaches, methods that jointly model parent offspring relationships within a trio have been developed specifically for DNM calling by utilizing Mendelian inheritance information within a trio. For example, de novo gear () calculates a posterior probability of being a true DNM call for every candidate variant site by taking into account all three samples' genotype likelihoods under a prior based on genome wide DNM rate. poly mutt () calculates maximum likelihoods of genotype configurations without and with Mendelian constraint, respectively, and then takes the ratio of the two resulting likelihoods as the cut off. The larger the ratio, the more confident the DNM call is. Due to the use of extra information in the model, joint modeling approaches achieve much improved accuracy compared to standard approaches (). Both standard and joint modeling approaches can achieve high sensitivity. However, in terms of specificity, despite the better performance of joint modeling over standard approaches, both approaches rely on information of single sites assuming all reads having been correctly mapped, so they can not eliminate false positive DNM calls originating from alignment mistakes. Heuristic filtering strategies and visual alignment inspection via genome browsers () are usually used to filter out such false positive DNM calls. However, it is inherently difficult to select appropriate filtering parameter combinations to accommodate sensitivity and specificity simultaneously; it is also impractical to manually inspect a large number of candidates. These challenges necessitate the development of effective and automated DNM filtering algorithms. Machine learning is a powerful approach to modeling complex multidimensional data and has been successfully applied to next generation sequencing (NGS) data to identify genetic variants. For example, Variant Quality Score Recalibration in Genome Analysis Toolkit g atk uses a semi supervised machine learning algorithm, Gaussian mixture model, to estimate the probability that each variant is a true polymorphism rather than a sequencer, alignment or data processing artifact, by evaluating sequence features extracted from true variants (typically HapMap 3 sites and polymorphic sites on the Omni 2.5M SNP chip array) (). Supervised machine learning algorithms, which usually train a model with known true and false positive variants, are also widely used to classify candidates as real variants versus artifacts. For example, snps vm (O') utilizes support vector machine (SVM) to detect single nucleotide variants sn vs the atlas 2 Suite () builds a logistic regression model to call sn vs insertions and deletions (INDELs); forests v () and SVM 2 () employs random forest (RF) () and SVM to detect large structural variants (SVs). In addition, mutations eq () makes use of four algorithms including RF, SVM, Bayesian additive regression tree () and logistic regression to identify somatic mutations from tumor normal paired sequencing data. Because these machine learning approaches can incorporate multidimensional sequence features into a model, they usually yield better results than approaches that are based on single or very few sequence features. Since dn ms are extremely rare, oftentimes real mutations are buried in a mass of false calls. In this article, we develop a supervised machine learning based approach, namely dnm filter to effectively sift out false DNM calls from a large number of putative candidates. We choose gradient boosting as the classification algorithm for dnm filter based on recent reports showing that it can achieve better performance than other supervised machine learning algorithms in many conditions () and our own preliminary comparative analysis (data not shown). dnm filter is designed to train a model based on experimentally validated and collected dn ms and then classify each novel candidate as a true or false DNM probabilistically in the following sections, we describe dnm filter a gradient boosting approach for classifying and filtering DNM candidates identified from any computational or manual approaches. We investigate multidimensional sequence features in whole genome and exo me alignment context that have been shown to be relevant to DNM calls. Then we illustrate how to employ gradient boosting to design dnm filter based on these features. We evaluate dnm filters theoretical performance and evaluate the contribution of different sequence features. Finally, we apply dnm filter on in house whole exo me trios and one whole genome CEU trio from the 1000 Genomes Project (1000GP) to investigate its general performance in practice given a training set of (x 1 , y 1 ), (x 2 , y 2 ),. .. , (x n , y n ), boosting aims to find n approximation ^ fx to a function f  x that minimizes the expected value of some specified loss function L(y, f(x)), as follows boosting iteratively fits an additive expansion of the form where m is the expansion coefficient, hx; m  is the base classifier parameterized by m : Gradient boosting is one kind of boosting algorithms that applies steepest descent to minimize the loss function on the training data. At iteration step m, the gradient is calculated by,. .. , fx n g T is updated as follows where m is the step length, which is calculated by gradient boosting machine () makes use of decision trees as the base classifiers and implements the above generic gradient boosting algorithm. In addition, stochastic gradient boosting () incorporates the idea of bagging to gradient boosting machine, which can improve the performance by fitting every base classifier with bootstrapped samples of the whole dataset at each iteration step. In this article, we use gradient boosting machine as well as stochastic gradient boosting implemented in the R gbm package (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gbm/index.html). As to the parameter settings, Bernoulli distribution is chosen as the loss function, shrinkage is set to 0.001, tree construction depth is set to 1 and bag fraction is set to 0.5. Moreover, 10-fold cross validation is used for tuning the number of iterations. The remaining parameters are all with gbm package's default settings. In addition, a score between 0 and 1 will be produced for each prediction, representing the probability of the classification as the true DNM.

discussion in summary, we developed dnm filter a novel gradient boosting based approach for filtering dn ms identified in parent offspring trios. We curated 59 sequence features in whole genome and exo me alignment context and employed gradient boosting as the classification algorithm. We built the training set with confirmed true and false positive dn ms as well as collected false positive dn ms. The evaluation of theoretical performance demonstrates that dnm filter works confidently for its designed purpose. According to feature relative importance measure, we showed that alignment error is a significant cause of false DNM calls. We also applied dnm filter on in house whole exo me trios and one 1000GP CEU trio, and found that dnm filter could maintain the high sensitivity and significantly reduce false positive dn ms when coupled with commonly used DNM detection approaches. All results indicate that dnm filter is a valuable complement for existing DNM detection approaches. By combining dnm filter with any DNM detection approach(es) into a pipeline, users can first relax the confidence of detection step to ensure sensitivity, and then dnm filter can be employed to filter out false positive DNM calls, which eventually leads to a reasonable size of highly confident DNM call set for experimental validation and further analysis. In particular, dnm filter is expected to work best when it is applied to samples from the same sequencing and alignment pipeline as the ones used in the training set. In future, we will consider extending dnm filter to other kinds of dn ms such as INDELs and SVs. Currently, dnm filters power is largely limited by the small number of known dn ms especially for potential de novo in del and SV filtering. As more parent offspring trios are sequenced in future, more dn ms within a more complete variant spectrum will be validated and incorporated into the training set. We plan to actively update dnm filter with new whole exo me and genome data to make it more effective and robust. We also consider incorporating additional relevant sequence features to capture a more comprehensive pattern discriminating true and false DNM calls that might not be represented by existing sequence features. We hope that dnm filter is useful to the community as either a stand-alone tool for detecting dn ms or a filtering strategy combined with other DNM detection tools to boost both sensitivity and specificity.

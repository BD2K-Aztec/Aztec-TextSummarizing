non targeted metabolomics technologies often yield data in which abundance for any given metabolite is observed and quantified for some samples and reported as missing for other samples. Apparent missing ness can be due to true absence of the metabolite in the sample or presence at a level below detectability. mixture model analysis can formally account for metabolite missing ness due to absence or un detectability but software for this type of analysis in the high throughput setting is limited. The R package metabo mx tr has been developed to facilitate mixture model analysis of non targeted metabolomics data in which only a portion of samples have quantifi-able abundance for certain metabolites.

introduction high throughput metabolomics profiling has surged in popularity with non targeted technologies in particular offering opportunity for discovery of new metabolite associations with phenotypes or outcomes. A challenge to analyzing non targeted output is the frequent occurrence of missing data (). These data are not 'missing' in the sense that they were not collected; rather, metabolites may be detected and their abundance quantified in some samples and not others. Typically conducted using nuclear magnetic resonance, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry or gas chromatography mass spectrometry (), non targeted assays typically have unknown lower detection thresholds. Thus, when a given metabolite is not detected, it is unknown whether that metabolite was indeed absent or merely undetectable. Several approaches for handling missing ness have been described in metabolomics literature, including complete case analysis, imputation and adaptations of classic dimension reduction tools to allow for missing data. For metabolite by metabolite analyses, imputation is common, with methods including minimum, median and nearest neighbor imputation (). Partial least squares discriminant analysis and principal components analysis with missing data adaptations have been used, although these methods identify regression based linear combinations of multiple correlated metabolites associated with a phenotype or outcome, and, in general, results are less translatable for understanding individual metabolite contributions (;). An underused approach for metabolite by metabolite analysis is the bernoulli lognormal mixture model proposed by. This method simultaneously estimates parameters modeling the probability of non missing response and the mean of observed values. Imputation is not required, and instead missing ness is explicitly modeled as either true absence or presence below detectability, consistent with non targeted metabolomics technology. We used mixture models to analyze GC-MS metabolomics data (), but, to our knowledge, there is no available software to easily perform these analyses that folds into existing high throughput data analysis pipelines. Noting the elegance of the mixture model approach and the continued issue of missing data in metabolomics research, we present metabo mx tr an R package that automates mixture model analysis.

discussion the R package metabo mx tr facilitates mixture model analysis of non targeted metabolomics data. Re-analysis of the h apo pilot metabolomics data indicates that mixture model analysis detects metabolites identified by other common imputation approaches and additionally identifies associations that would otherwise be missed. Rigorous testing of mixture models on a wider scale is warranted. In summary, metabo mx tr provides metabolomics researchers a previously unavailable tool for handling non targeted metabolomics missing ness

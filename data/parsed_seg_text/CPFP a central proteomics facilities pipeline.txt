The central proteomics facilities pipeline c pfp provides identification, validation, and quantitation of peptides and proteins from lcms ms datasets through an easy to use web interface. It is the first analysis pipeline targeted specifically at the needs of proteomics core facilities, reducing the data analysis load on staff, and allowing facility clients to easily access and work with their data. Identification of peptides is performed using multiple search engines, their output combined and validated using state of the art techniques for improved results. Cluster execution of jobs allows analysis capacity to be increased easily as demand grows. Availability: Released under the Common Development and Distribution License at

introduction mass spectrometry (MS) has emerged as the dominant technique for the identification and quantitation of peptides and proteins from complex mixtures. A large number of institutions have established core proteomics facilities to provide MS services, sharing equipment and expertise with a wide range of users (). With the growth in demand for high throughput lcms ms analysis of complex samples, and increased interest in quantitative proteomics, effective analysis of data can be challenging. Existing freely available pipelines such as TPP (), CPAS lab key Software Foundation), open ms to pp (), swiss pit () and mas spectra s () support a variety of proteomics search engines and validation tools, but often require users to understand the various parameter formats of the search engines, reconcile differences in post-translational modification (PTM) specifications and manually run multiple searches if more than one search engine is to be used. Commercial applications such as Scaffold (Proteome Software, Portland OR, USA), PEAKS (Bioinformatics Solutions Inc., Waterloo ON, Canada) and Sorcerer (Sage-N Research, Milpitas CA, USA) provide user friendly interfaces but require significant outlay if multiple licences are required. The central proteomics facilities pipeline c pfp aims to provide a simple

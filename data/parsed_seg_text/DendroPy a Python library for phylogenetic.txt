den drop y is a cross platform library for the Python programming language that provides for object oriented reading, writing, simulation and manipulation of phylogenetic data, with an emphasis on phylogenetic tree operations. den drop y uses a splits hash mapping to perform rapid calculations of tree distances, similarities and shape under various metrics. It contains rich simulation routines to generate trees under a number of different phylogenetic and coalescent models. den drop ys data simulation and manipulation facilities, in conjunction with its support of a broad range of phylogenetic data formats (NEXUS, Newick, PHYLIP, fast a ne xml etc.), allow it to serve a useful role in various phylo informatics and phylo geographic pipelines. Availability: The stable release of the library is available for download and automated installation through the Python Package Index site (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/DendroPy), while the active development source code repository is available to the public from git hub
introduction here we describe den drop y a cross platform library for the management, manipulation and analysis of phylogenetic tree and character data using the Python programming language. den drop y addresses needs of researchers in phylo informatics and population genetics. It supports reading and writing phylogenetic data in a wide variety of file formats (NEXUS, PHYLIP, fast a ne xml etc.) to and from the same common object oriented data model. Its data model is rich and well suited for manipulating complex datasets. Objects represent both core phylogenetic entities (such as tax a trees, and character matrices), as well both components and collections of these objects. For example, den drop ys representation of phylogenetic trees includes a class for the tree itself, but also classes for nodes, directed edges and support for the concept of splits (also known as bi partitions as well as collections of these tree objects. Splits are crucial in many phylogenetic algorithms that operate on unrooted tree, such as consensus tree generation () and the calculation of tree to tree distances (). den drop ys hashing of splits allows for constant time lookup of an edge in a tree. In memory, trees are represented as rooted, but splits of either unrooted or rooted trees are efficiently stored by hashing. Thus, den drop y handles both types of trees very naturally. * To whom correspondence should be addressed. den drop y is designed to deal with diverse sources of datasets. Character data and trees refer to rich tax on objects, and users of the library have fine grained control of how these tax a are coordinated or kept separate across different sources of data. Thus, importing information from a wide variety of sources can be accomplished without unintentionally concatenating information. This makes den drop y a convenient tool in the domains of bioinformatics (e.g. phylogenetic super matrix assembly and phylogeography), in which the character data associated with trees is derived from multiple exemplars of the same biological tax on. den drop y also provides a rich framework for the simulation of trees under a variety of branching models, such as the birth death model (uniform or variable), the coalescent (), the censored coalescent (), etc. Below we describe the main features of den drop y in more detailed terms, and discuss its relationship to the existing python libraries for bioinformatics.

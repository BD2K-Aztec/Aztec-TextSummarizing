It is now easy and increasingly usual to produce oriented rnase q data as a prokaryotic genome is being sequenced. However, this information is usually just used for expression quantifi-cation. eugene pp is a fully automated pipeline for structural annotation of prokaryotic genomes integrating protein similarities, statistical information and any oriented expression information rnase q or tiling arrays) through a variety of file formats to produce a qualitatively enriched annotation including coding regions but also (possibly anti-sense) non-coding genes and transcription start sites. Availability and implementation: eugene pp is an open source software based on eugene p integrating a Galaxy

introduction prokaryotic genome sequencing and expression quantification using rnase q or tiling arrays are becoming routine. However, existing prokaryotic gene finders are either ab initio gene finders that identify only coding regions () or purely rnase q based gene finders predicting transcripts () and are much less effective than their ab initio competitors for Coding DNA Sequence (CDS) prediction (). Reconciling conflicting predictions is a tedious work, which is incompatible with the growing prokaryotic genome sequencing rate. There is a need for new prokaryotic gene finders that would directly integrate all available information to produce an enriched and precise structural annotation identifying CDS but also (possibly antisense) non-coding genes and transcription start sites tss s avoiding tedious reconciliation. We have shown in that this can be accomplished by finely adapting conditional random field based integrative eukaryotic gene finding technology () to prokaryotic specificities (overlapping genes, operons). The resulting software, eugene p simultaneously exploits statistical properties of sequences, existing annotations, similarities to proteins and oriented rnase q data to produce an enriched annotation with a better delineation of functional genomic elements, and therefore improved expression quantification.

The R package easy strata facilitates the evaluation and visualization of stratified genome wide association meta analyses gw am as results. It provides (i) statistical methods to test and account for between strata difference as a means to tackle gene strata interaction effects and (ii) extended graphical features tailored for stratified gw am a results. The software provides further features also suitable for general gw am as including functions to annotate, exclude or highlight specific loci in plots or to extract independent subsets of loci from genome wide datasets. It is freely available and includes a user friendly scripting interface that simplifies data handling and allows for combining statistical and graphical functions in a flexible fashion. Availability: easy strata is available for free (under the GNU General Public License v3) from our Web site www gene pi regensburg de easy strata and from the CRAN R package repository cran r project. org web packages easy strata
introduction genome wide association meta analyses gw am as in which multiple study specific genome wide association (GWA) results are pooled, have resulted in a 10 to 20-fold increase in the number of known genes contributing to complex traits and diseases (). Meanwhile, a focus is also on gene environment wide interaction analyses gew is that are conducted to further characterize genetic main effects as well as to discover novel genetic associations that are only present under certain environmental conditions gene environment interaction, GxE). Although some gew is have already extended from single study analyses to meta analyses so far, only few reported replicable GxE effects (). For categorical environmental factors E, gew is meta analyses can be implemented as gw am as stratified by E, for example, a gw am a stratified by sex or by smoking status. Stratified gw am as do not only improve power to detect stratum sensitive genetic main effects () but also allow for testing gene strata (GxS) interaction and joint (main + interaction) effects (). Although a variety of methods for the analysis of stratified gw am a results exist, the availability of software tools is limited (see supplementary for a comparison with other g was tools). We have developed an r package called easy strata which allows the user to obtain statistical and graphical summaries for comparisons across strata and to investigate potential GxS effects. The software was developed within the GxE working groups of the GIANT (Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits) consortium, and the functionality of the package is exemplified on gw am a results for anthropometric traits, which are publically available at www broad institute org collaboration giant. easy strata is applicable to stratified gw am as of continuous or dichotomous outcomes, and many of the functions are also applicable for non stratified gw am as (Supplementary Note).

Motivation: Developers of new methods in computational structural biology are often hampered in their research by incompatible software tools and non standardized data formats. To address this problem, we have developed open structure as a modular open source platform to provide a powerful, yet flexible general working environment for structural bioinformatics. open structure consists primarily of a set of libraries written in C++ with a cleanly designed application programmer interface. All functionality can be accessed directly in C++ or in a Python layer, meeting both the requirements for high efficiency and ease of use. Powerful selection queries and the notion of entity views to represent these selections greatly facilitate the development and implementation of algorithms on structural data. The modular integration of computational core methods with powerful visualization tools makes open structure an ideal working and development environment. Several applications, such as the latest versions of i plt and q mean have been implemented based on open structure demonstrating its value for the development of next generation structural biology algorithms.

introduction we introduce open structure a flexible software framework for computational structural biology, a solid, yet flexible and versatile toolkit for rapid prototyping of new methods as well as their productive implementation. Typically, method development in structural bioinformatics involves combining different independent software tools, and significant effort is devoted to writing code for input output operations and format conversions between different packages. This culminates when data and algorithms from different domains are to be combined, e.g. protein structures, protein sequence annotation and chemical ligands. Several software tools and frameworks are available today for molecular modeling, e.g. MMTK * To whom correspondence should be addressed.(), Coot () mol ide (), Modeller (), bioinformatics algorithms libraries, e.g. BALL (), workflow automation tools, e.g. bis kit () or kni me www kni me org and visualization e.g. VMD (), PyMol www pymol org DINO (www.dino3d.org), or swiss pdb viewer (). open structure is a flexible software framework tailored for computational structural biology, which combines a C++ based library of commonly used functionality with a Python layer and powerful visualization tools. While PyMol and VMD also combine a scripting environment with sophisticated visualization tools, they are primarily geared toward visualization and less on providing a clean application programmer interface (API) that is easy to use and allows for rapid development of new algorithms. open structure is also designed to easily accommodate interfaces to already existing software. This allows for rapid visually enhanced prototyping of new functionality, making open structure an ideal environment for the development of next generation structural biology algorithms. For example, new versions of the q mean tools for model quality assessment (, b) are based on open structure as well as the structural analysis tools in protein model portal (). Further, work is on the way to implement the next generation of the swiss model pipeline using the open structure framework ().

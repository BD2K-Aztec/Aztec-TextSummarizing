Motivation: Histone acetylation (HAc) is associated with open chromatin, and HAc has been shown to facilitate transcription factor (TF) binding in mammalian cells. In the innate immune system context, epigenetic studies strongly implicate HAc in the transcriptional response of activated macrophages. We hypothesized that using data from large scale sequencing of a HAc chromatin immunoprecipitation assay chips eq would improve the performance of computational prediction of binding locations of TFs mediating the response to a signaling event, namely, macrophage activation. Results: We tested this hypothesis using a multi evidence approach for predicting binding sites. As a training test dataset, we used chips eq derived TF binding site locations for five TFs in activated murine macrophages. Our model combined TF binding site motif scanning with evidence from sequence based sources and from HAc chips eq data, using a weighted sum of thresholded scores. We find that using HAc data significantly improves the performance of motif based TF binding site prediction. Furthermore, we find that within regions of high HAc, local minima of the HAc chips eq signal are particularly strongly correlated with TF binding locations. Our model, using motif scanning and HAc local minima, improves the sensitivity for TF binding site prediction by âˆ¼50% over a model based on motif scanning alone, at a false positive rate cut off of 0.01.

introduction mammalian cells exhibit diverse transcriptional profiles across different cell types and conditions, for example, in immune cells activated with different pathogen associated molecules (). To a large extent, these profiles are controlled by the arrangement and chromatin accessibility of cis regulatory * To whom correspondence should be addressed. elements (). Transcription factors (TFs) bind specific sequence elements in chromatin locations of permissive epigenetic or conformational states, leading to activation or repression of transcriptional activity. For mapping these regulatory interactions, it is particularly promising that the binding of a TF can now be measured genome wide using chromatin immunoprecipitation (IP) with sequence detection (). However, antibody and cellular material requirements preclude using chips eq to screen for all TFs mediating a transcriptional response. There remains a need for computational approaches that can, in the absence of experimental TF binding data, leverage transcriptional data and genomic information to identify the network of TFs and binding sites that underlies a transcriptional response. An important tool for predicting mammalian TF binding sites is motif scanning, i.e. searching DNA sequence for matches within a library of sequence motifs reported to be bound by specific TFs (). Such a library enables mapping between a scanning identified sequence element and one or more candidate TFs that may bind it. However, such motifs are often highly uncertain and they can be degenerate, leading to a high frequency of false positive predictions (). Furthermore, mammalian cis regulatory elements can be tens of kilobases from transcription start sites, necessitating searching large sequence regions and further increasing false positives. These issues undermine the performance of motif scanning as a standalone approach. Successful motif based prediction of TF binding depends on identifying the sequence regions, within the relevant cell type, that are likely to contain cis regulatory elements (). It has been observed that cis regulatory elements tend to co occur with chromatin or sequence features that can be grouped in three categories: (i) chromatin structural features such as DNase I hypersensitive sites; (ii) epigenetic marks such as histone acetylation (HAc); and (iii) sequence features such as high GC content and conservation across species. The HAc mark, which has been associated with active promoters and open chromatin (), is of particular relevance to transcriptional regulation because the modification can be placed or removed in response to the cellular state. These observations have spurred the development of approaches that integrate data for multiple types of chromatin features to improve the accuracy of TF binding site predictions. Various data integration frameworks for binding site prediction have been used, including the support vector machine (), probabilistic methods and its upstream regulatory region, with TF binding data and various feature tracks. Measured binding locations for the TF NFB/p50 are shown in orange (top row). Each feature track is displayed in colored vertical bars interspersed every 100 bp: HAc chips eq signal (magenta); 'valley scores' (VS) for HAc local minima (blue); normalized NFB binding site motif match scores (red); DNA sequence GC content (green); nucleosome occupancy score (green); and vertebrate conservation score for genomic sequence (green). The NFB binding sites correspond to local minima in the HAc chips eq signal. Inset: Within a local minimum of the chips eq signal (magenta curve), the smaller of the maximum signal values on either side of the local minimum is computed, and the entire local minimum region is assigned that value as its VS, and the value zero outside the local minimum region (blue lines) (Supplementary Section S1.6). (B) The distribution of HAc ChIP VS from stimulated cells in tf bound sites differs substantially from non tf bound sites, as shown in the two histograms (note the logarithmic vertical scale).

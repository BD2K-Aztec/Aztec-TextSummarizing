Motivation: Abstract shape analysis, first proposed in 2004, allows one to extract several relevant structures from the folding space of an RNA sequence, preferable to focusing in a single structure of minimal free energy. We report recent extensions to this approach. Results: We have rebuilt the original rna shapes as a repository of components that allows us to integrate several established tools for RNA structure analysis: rna shapes rna ali shapes and pk not srg including its recent extension p kiss. As a spin-off, we obtain heretofore unavailable functionality: e. g. with p kiss we can now perform abstract shape analysis for structures holding pseudo knots up to the complexity of kissing hairpin motifs. The new tool pali kiss can predict kissing hairpin motifs from aligned sequences. Along with the integration, the functionality of the tools was also extended in manifold ways. Availability and implementation: As before, the tool is available on the Bielefeld Bioinformatics server at

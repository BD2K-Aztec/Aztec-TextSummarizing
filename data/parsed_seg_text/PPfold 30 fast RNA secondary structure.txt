pp fold is a multi-threaded implementation of the p fold algorithm for RNA secondary structure prediction. Here we present a new version of pp fold which extends the evolutionary analysis with a flexible probabilistic model for incorporating auxiliary data, such as data from structure probing experiments. Our tests show that the accuracy of single sequence secondary structure prediction using experimental data in pp fold 3.0 is comparable to rna structure. Furthermore, alignment structure prediction quality is improved even further by the addition of experimental data. pp fold 3.0 therefore has the potential of producing more accurate predictions than it was previously possible. Availability and implementation: pp fold 3.0 is available as a platform independent Java application and can be downloaded from

introduction the p fold package predicts non pseudo knotted RNA secondary structure by combining a stochastic context free grammar s cfg with an evolutionary model (). pp fold is a recent multi-threaded re-implementation of p fold (SukosdSuko). The p fold model has been shown to result in highly accurate predictions when the input alignment is of high quality (). In a different approach, data from high throughput quantitative RNA structure probing methods have also recently been used in thermodynamic prediction methods to increase prediction accuracy (). However, phylogenetic and probing data have only been used independently in RNA secondary structure prediction so far. Here, we present pp fold 3.0, which integrates these different sources of information at the level of the model. This is expected to increase prediction accuracy beyond what is possible with either evolutionary information or experimental data alone.

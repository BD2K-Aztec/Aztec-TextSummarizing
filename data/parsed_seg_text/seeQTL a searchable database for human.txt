see qtl is a comprehensive and versatile e qtl database, including various e qtl studies and a meta analysis of HapMap e qtl information. The database presents e qtl association results in a convenient browser, using both segmented local association plots and genome wide Manhattan plots. Availability and implementation: see qtl is freely available for non-commercial use at

introduction the association of RNA expression traits with DNA variation, including from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variants cn vs has been a subject of active inquiry in recent years, shedding light on fundamental biological processes underlying transcription. Here we use the generic term 'expression quantitative trait loci' e qtls to describe these DNA variants and their associated expression traits (). A large number of studies have been published on HapMap lymphoblastoid cell lines and other human tissues, covering several continental level populations (). In addition to the general importance of dissecting transcriptional regulation, e qtl analysis may also provide a window into the mechanisms underlying transcription mediated disease (). Several online databases are available which report e qtl associations based on published datasets. SCAN () is a large scale database of genetic and genomic data, which allows users to search for e qtls by querying multiple genes or snps cn vs but is not designed primarily as an e qtl database. The e qtl Browser () is based on the Gbrowse platform () and displays results from multiple studies and allows navigation throughout the genome. The g tex genotype tissue Expression) e qtl database will be populated by tissue specific e qtl information as the g tex project

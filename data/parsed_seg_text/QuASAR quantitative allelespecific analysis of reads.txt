Motivation: Expression quantitative trait loci e qtl studies have discovered thousands of genetic variants that regulate gene expression, enabling a better understanding of the functional role of non-coding sequences. However, e qtl studies are costly, requiring large sample sizes and genome wide genotyping of each sample. In contrast, analysis of allele specific expression (ASE) is becoming a popular approach to detect the effect of genetic variation on gene expression, even within a single individual. This is typically achieved by counting the number of rnase q reads matching each allele at heterozygous sites and testing the null hypothesis of a 1:1 allelic ratio. In principle, when genotype information is not readily available, it could be inferred from the rnase q reads directly. However, there are currently no existing methods that jointly infer genotypes and conduct ASE inference, while considering uncertainty in the genotype calls. Results: We present QuASAR, quantitative allele specific analysis of reads, a novel statistical learning method for jointly detecting heterozygous genotypes and inferring ASE. The proposed ASE inference step takes into consideration the uncertainty in the genotype calls, while including parameters that model base call errors in sequencing and allelic over dispersion. We validated our method with experimental data for which high quality genotypes are available. Results for an additional dataset with multiple replicates at different sequencing depths demonstrate that QuASAR is a powerful tool for ASE analysis when genotypes are not available.

introduction quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for molecular cellular phenotypes (as defined by), such as gene expression [expression QTL e qtl (e.g.), transcription factor binding () and DNase I sensitivity () have begun to provide a better understanding of how genetic variants in regulatory sequences can affect gene expression levels (see also). e qtl studies in particular have been successful at identifying genomic regions associated with gene expression in various tissues and conditions (e.g.). Although previous studies have shown an enrichment for g was hits among regulatory variants in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) (), a full e qtl data are available and will represent a useful resource to functionally annotate genetic variants. However, the number of cell types and environments explored are a small subset of the presumably larger number of regulatory variants that mediate specific GxE interactions. e qtl studies are expensive, requiring large sample sizes (n  70), which may be difficult to achieve for tissues that are obtained by surgical procedures or are difficult to culture in vitro. Even if bio specimens are readily available at no cost, e qtl studies require large amounts of experimental work to measure genotypes and gene expression levels. As the measurement of gene expression using high throughput sequencing rnase q is becoming more popular than microarrays, rnase q library preparation is also becoming less expensive 46 sample whereas costs of sequencing are also very rapidly decreasing (e.g. 16M reads per sample would cost $49 using a multiplexing strategy). Additionally, the sequence information provided by rnase q can be used to call genotypes (), detect and quantify isoforms () and to measure allele specific expression (ASE), if enough sequencing depth is available (). ASE approaches currently represent the most effective way to assay the effect of a cis regulatory variant within a defined cellular environment, while controlling for any trans-acting modifiers of gene expression, such as the genotype at other loci (Cowper). As such, ASE studies have greater statistical power to detect genetic effects in cis than a traditional e qtl mapping approach when using a small sample size. Additionally, ASE may also be useful to detect epigenetic imprinting of gene expression if ASE is present but no e qtl is detected (). In the absence of ASE, the two alleles for a heterozygous genotype at a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in a gene transcript are represented in a 1:1 ratio of rnase q reads. To reject the null hypothesis and infer ASE, it is necessary to first identify heterozygous SNPs with high confidence and then conduct inference to detect a departure from a 50% allelic ratio. Although genotyping and ASE are usually considered two separate problems, mis calling a homozygous SNP as heterozygous is likely to induce an error in rejecting the ASE null hypothesis; thus, we argue that the two problems should addressed together. Although it is possible to obtain genotype information from rnase q (), to the best of our knowledge, all existing methods for detecting ASE consider the genotypes known and error probabilities associated with genotyping are not taken into account for the ASE step. Although overall genotyping quality can also be modeled within the ASE model (), there is currently no method that for each SNP can jointly genotype and detect allelic imbalances in high throughput sequencing data. An approach that takes into account base calling errors was previously proposed for detecting ASE in ESTs data (), but for rnase q data, it is essential to also include over dispersion. Here, we propose a novel framework for quantitative allele specific analysis of reads (QuASAR) that starts from a single or multiple rnase q experiments from the same individual and can directly identify heterozygous SNPs and assess ASE accurately by taking into account base calling errors and over dispersion in the ASE ratio. QuASAR is evaluated with two different datasets that demonstrate genotyping accuracy and the importance of incorporating the genotype uncertainty when performing ASE inference.

discussion quasar is the first approach that detects genotypes and infers ASE from the same sequencing data. In this work, we focused on rnase q but QuASAR can be applied to other data types chips eq dnase seq at a cseq and others). Indeed, the more experimental data available from the same individual across many experimental. qq plot comparing the P value distribution of three alternative methods for determining ASE. The x axis shows the log 10 quantiles of the P values expected from the null distribution. The y-axis shows the log 10 quantiles of the P values computed from the real data using three different methods: (i) binomial (black) assumes M  1 no over dispersion (ii) beta binomial (green) considers over dispersion but does not consider uncertainty in the genotype and (iii) QuASAR (blue) uses the beta binomial distribution and uncertainty in the genotype calls. In all three cases, the same set of SNPs is considered. The shaded area in gray indicates a 95% confidence band for the null distribution samples (data types, conditions, cell types or technical replicates), the more certainty we can gather about the genotype. A key aspect of the QuASAR ASE inference step is that it takes into account over dispersion and genotype uncertainty resulting in a test that we have shown to be well calibrated. In many cases, the P values obtained from biased statistics can be recalibrated to the true null distribution using a permutation procedure. Unfortunately, this is not possible for ASE inference, as randomly permuting the reads assigned to each allele would inadvertently assume that the reads are distributed according to a binomial distribution. More complicated and computationally costly resampling procedures can be proposed, but it is not clear what additional assumptions may be introduced and if such methods can correctly take into account genotyping uncertainty. If prior genotype information is available, it can also be provided as input to the algorithm. The prior uncertainty of the genotypes should be reflected in the form of prior probabilities for each genotype. In this article, we have shown that we can obtain reliable genotype information from rnase q reads, thus making additional genotyping unnecessary if the endpoint is to detect ASE. Instead, sequencing the rnase q libraries at a higher depth is probably a better strategy as it greatly improves the power to detect ASE. Furthermore, as sequencing costs decrease rapidly, ASE methods are becoming very attractive in applications where e qtl studies have been previously used. This is of increased importance in scenarios where collecting a large number of samples is expensive or infeasible. large scale e qtl studies are still very much necessary for fine mapping, but analysis of ASE can provide unique insights into mechanisms that are uncovered only under specific experimental conditions, e.g. as a result of gene x environment interactions.

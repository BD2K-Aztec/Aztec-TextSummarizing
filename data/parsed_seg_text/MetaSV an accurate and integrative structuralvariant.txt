Structural variations (SVs) are large genomic rearrangements that vary significantly in size, making them challenging to detect with the relatively short reads from next generation sequencing (NGS). Different SV detection methods have been developed; however, each is limited to specific kinds of SVs with varying accuracy and resolution. Previous works have attempted to combine different methods, but they still suffer from poor accuracy particularly for insertions. We propose meta sv an integrated SV caller which leverages multiple orthogonal SV signals for high accuracy and resolution. meta sv proceeds by merging SVs from multiple tools for all types of SVs. It also analyzes soft clipped reads from alignment to detect insertions accurately since existing tools underestimate insertion SVs. Local assembly in combination with dynamic programming is used to improve breakpoint resolution. paired end and coverage information is used to predict SV genotypes. Using simulation and experimental data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of meta sv across various SV types and sizes. Availability and implementation: Code in Python is at

introductions vs have been implicated in contributing to genomic diversity as well as genomic disorders (). Therefore, a significant amount of work has been done on detecting SVs. Generally, a tool for detecting SVs uses one or more of the following signals from read alignments: split read [reads with split alignments, e.g. pin del (, read pair [abnormal paired end alignments, e.g. break dancer (, depth of coverage [abnormal coverages, e.g. cnv nator (, junction mapping [alignments to known SV breakpoints, e.g. breaks eq2 (or assembly around potential breakpoints [e.g. mind the gap (. However, there is no signal that comprehensively detects all types of SVs since each has a niche of SV types and sizes where it V C The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press.

Unlike DNA, RNA abundances can vary over several orders of magnitude. Thus, identification of rna protein binding sites from high throughput sequencing data presents unique challenges. Although peak identification in chips eq data has been extensively explored, there are few bioinformatics tools tailored for peak calling on analogous datasets for rna binding proteins. Here we describe a speak (abundance sensitive peak detection algorithm), an implementation of an algorithm that we previously applied to detect peaks in exon junction complex RNA immunoprecipitation in tandem experiments. Our peak detection algorithm yields stringent and robust target sets enabling sensitive motif finding and downstream functional analyses. Availability: a speak is implemented in Perl as a complete pipeline that takes bed graph files as input. a speak implementation is freely available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/as-peak under the GNU General Public License. a speak can be run on a personal computer, yet is designed to be easily parallelizable. a speak can also run on high performance computing clusters providing efficient speed up. The documentation and user manual can be obtained from http://master. dl sourceforge net project as peak manual pdf
introduction high throughput sequencing of short RNA fragments directly associated with rna binding proteins enables transcriptome wide mapping of protein binding sites on RNAs. Such binding sites can be enriched by either immuno purification (IP) of RNA protein complexes (RIP) or cross-linking followed by IP (CLIP) (). These approaches are analogous to ChIP experiments for dna binding proteins. Although identification of peaks in chips eq data has been addressed by numerous approaches (), development of specific bioinformatics tools for rna protein binding site identification has lagged behind with few alternatives (). With the recent explosion of high throughput sequencing data for dozens of rna binding proteins, there is an urgent need to develop efficient and user friendly applications to better address the computational challenges of identifying peaks in sequences with variable starting abundances. Here, we describe a new peak detection algorithm that is sensitive to differential expression levels of target transcripts. This approach enables robust peak detection even in low abundance transcripts. We previously used our algorithm to define binding sites for the exon junction complex (EJC) (). Here we describe an open source and a much improved implementation of this abundance sensitive peak detection algorithm a speak
conclusion a speak is a fast and efficient expression sensitive peak caller for clip and rip seq data. a speak implementation has the ability to run on multiple processors resulting in a significant speed up when used on high performance computing centers. Compared with MACS or Piranha, a speak provides comparable or better results when used in an expression sensitive mode. In addition, a speak is supported with extensive documentation that allows experienced bioinformatic ians to customize their analyses using detailed parameter files. Finally, a streamlined mode is available for biologists with limited knowledge of Linux systems to easily run a speak using default settings. Our implementation, a speak is an open source command line program. Input files are rnase q CLIP-/ rip seq data in BED/ samba m bowtie format and region annotation files such as RefSeq in BED format. Peak regions are output in a tab separated format. a speak can be run using a single command in a streamlined and simple manner. additional y a speak can be parallelized and allows advanced users to run different steps separately for effective debugging and specialized applications.

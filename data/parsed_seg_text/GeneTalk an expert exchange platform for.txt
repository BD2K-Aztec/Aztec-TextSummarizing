next generation sequencing has become a powerful tool in personalized medicine. exo mes or even whole genomes of patients suffering from rare diseases are screened for sequence variants. After filtering out common polymorphisms, the assessment and interpretation of detected personal variants in the clinical context is an often time consuming effort. We have developed gene talk a web based platform that serves as an expert exchange network for the assessment of personal and potentially disease relevant sequence variants. gene talk assists a clinical geneticist who is searching for information about specific sequence variants and connects this user to other users with expertise for the same sequence variant. Availability: gene talk is available at www gene talk de. Users can login without registering in a demo account.

introduction exo me sequencing has become an in valu ably powerful tool in the identification of disease causing variants () and the first patients are now already treated based on sequence variant information of their exo mes (). To date, the primary bottleneck in such clinical personal genome cases is not anymore data generation but data analysis. Clinical geneticists therefore require efficient tools for filtering and interpreting the clinically meaningful sequence variants. Currently, the most potent filters for reducing the set of novel and potentially causal mutations in rare diseases are based on variation data from population scale sequencing efforts such as the 1000 genomes project (www.1000genomes.org). Only very few variants will be medically relevant, perhaps in case of a monogenic disorder just one. Bioinformatics tools such as an novar () and mutation taster () may then be used for comprehensive annotations and predictions about the expected pathogenicity of a variant. However, such classifiers have high false positive and negative error rates. They may therefore serve only for prioritization but can not replace the assessment of human experts.

application gene talk is an exchange platform that allows users to look for variant specific information and makes human expertise searchable (). Any sequence variant with respect to the human reference genome, based on the GRCh37 assembly, is an not a table. The user decides to whom an annotation is visible. One user may link to scientific articles that are relevant in context with a certain variant or that even provide evidence that a mutation is disease causing. A second user might comment on this annotation to express her concern because she views the detected variant as an technical artefact. A third user might state that she has seen patients with this genotype and is not sure about the statistical significance of the association with the phenotype. All annotations and comments of gene talk users about a certain genomic position can be read like a locus specific conversation thread. The trustworthiness of annotations can be rated by users as well as the likelihood of a mutation to be disease causing ().

This annotation track is thus curated in a collaborative effort of all gene talk users. gene talk also assists users in filtering genetic variants from NGS projects. A user that has a patient's informed consent to analyze the clinical data may upload sequence variants to gene talk in variant call format (VCF) (), version 4.0 and above. In order to reduce the initial VCF to a set of potentially disease relevant mutations, the user can apply certain filter settings first: the list of variants could be restricted to, e.g. only nonsynonymous, homozygous variants with the functional and inheritance filter. Common variants can be filtered out by a genotype frequency filter that is based on high quality NGS data sets from HapMap, the 1000 genomes project and the 5000 exo mes project. If a linkage analysis has been performed, a genomic interval may be set to limit the search space or gene panels may be applied as in silico filters to restrict the analysis to certain molecular pathways. In a rare recessive monogenic disease, the mode of inheritance and the genotype frequency filter that is set to 1/1000 usually reduce the number of candidate mutations down to a few hundreds in a patient's exo me. These variants may then be further analyzed for disease causing annotations. If the pathogenic mutation of this case has not yet been described in the literature and no 'pathogenic' annotation exists, the user can look for annotations that discuss patients with similar phenotypes or basic research scientists that talk about unpublished experimental data for this gene. Such an annotation can serve as a conversation starter and the users can simply contact the author by clicking on the envelope symbol (). Currently, the annotation database contains over 32 000 clinically relevant entries from dBSNP. A video tutorial on www gene talk de illustrates how an exo me dataset may be analyzed in gene talk In a few easy steps, the variant data of a simulated patient with hyper phos phat asia with mental retardation syndrome are filtered down to the disease causing mutation.

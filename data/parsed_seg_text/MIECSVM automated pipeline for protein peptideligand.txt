Motivation: m iec svm is a structure based method for predicting protein recognition specificity. Here, we present an automated m iec svm pipeline providing an integrated and user friendly workflow for construction and application of the m iec svm models. This pipeline can handle standard amino acids and those with post-translational modifications (PTMs) or small molecules. Moreover, multi-threading and support to Sun Grid Engine (SGE) are implemented to significantly boost the computational efficiency. Availability and implementation: The program is available at

introduction accurate prediction of the binding specificity of proteins, particularly those whose interacting partners are conformationally flexible, remains a great challenge. Many computational methods have been developed to meet this challenge () and one of them is the m iec svm method. This method has been successfully applied to predict the binding specificity of diverse systems including SH3 domains (), PDZ domains (), chromo domains () and HIV protease (). Here, we present an automated m iec svm pipeline that allows users to predict interacting partners using the existing m iec svm models as well as to construct new models for the protein families of their own interest.

conclusion the m iec svm method is a powerful tool to predict the binding specificity of proteins. The pipeline presented here automates the model training and prediction, which will greatly facilitate the broader application of this method.

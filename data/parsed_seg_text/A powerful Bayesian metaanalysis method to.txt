Motivation: Much research effort has been devoted to the identification of enriched gene sets for microarray experiments. However, identified gene sets are often found to be inconsistent among independent studies. This is probably owing to the noisy data of microarray experiments coupled with small sample sizes of individual studies. Therefore, combining information from multiple studies is likely to improve the detection of truly enriched gene classes. As more and more data become available, it calls for statistical methods to integrate information from multiple studies, also known as meta analysis to improve the power of identifying enriched gene sets. Results: We propose a Bayesian model that provides a coherent framework for joint modeling of both gene set information and gene expression data from multiple studies, to improve the detection of enriched gene sets by leveraging information from different sources available. One distinct feature of our method is that it directly models the gene expression data, instead of using summary statistics, when synthesizing studies. Besides, the proposed model is flexible and offers an appropriate treatment of between study heterogeneities that frequently arise in the meta analysis of microarray experiments. We show that under our Bayesian model, the full posterior conditionals all have known distributions, which greatly facilitates the MCMC computation. Simulation results show that the proposed method can improve the power of gene set enrichment meta analysis as opposed to existing methods developed by Shen and Tseng (2010, Bioinformatics, 26, 1316â€“1323), and it is not sensitive to mild or moderate deviations from the distributional assumption for gene expression data. We illustrate the proposed method through an application of combining eight lung cancer datasets for gene set enrichment analysis, which demonstrates the usefulness of the method.

introduction although microarray analysis initially focused on identifying differentially expressed (DE) genes, increased attention has been paid to pathway or gene set analysis, which aims to detect altered biological pathways or other pre-defined gene classes rather than individual genes (e.g.). Gene sets are usually defined based on gene functions, ontology information, chromosomal proximity or known regulatory relationships. Gene sets that are altered in responding to changes in phenotypes or treatments may provide important insights into molecular functions and gene regulatory relationships underlying biological processes. Also, it has been reported that gene set analysis tends to yield more reproducible and interpretable results than single gene analysis (). A major type of the gene set analysis is to determine whether a pre-defined category of genes is enriched (i.e. over-represented) by DE genes, often referred to as gene set (or pathway) enrichment analysis. A gene set is claimed to be enriched if it contains more DE genes than would be expected by chance. Many methods have been developed in gene set enrichment analysis for a single genomic study. For recent reviews, see and the references therein. Although plenty of gene expression data are publicly available now, it is challenging to integrate information of gene set enrichment analysis from multiple genomic studies targeting the same biological problem. Often sample sizes of individual studies are not large and microarray data are noisy, making estimation and inference highly variable. This often leads to inconsistent conclusions across studies. Integrative analysis of independent studies may facilitate information sharing and improve the power of detecting truly enriched gene classes, as well as increase reproducibility and interpretability. However, direct combination of multiple microarray datasets such as stacking them into one is extremely difficult owing to the incompatibility of data generated from various microarray platforms and different versions within the same platform (). Therefore, meta analysis a systematic statistical synthesis of data from multiple studies, has been widely used to aggregate evidence from related studies (). Most meta analyses currently target gene level analysis with the exception of Shen and who for the first time, systematically developed and evaluated meta analysis for pathway enrichment analysis in *To whom correspondence should be addressed. y The authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the first two authors should be regarded as joint First Authors.

They proposed three methods, namely, meta analysis for pathway enrichment at gene level map eg meta analysis for pathway enrichment at pathway level map ep and meta analysis for pathway enrichment integrated (MAPE_I), all based on the popular method g sea () for enrichment analysis. All these methods consist of two key stages. The first is to conduct differential expression analysis to obtain gene level statistics for each individual study. The second stage is to conduct pathway enrichment analysis and meta analysis in either order, where the order distinguishes map eg from map ep map eg first conducts meta analysis to combine the gene level results over all the studies, and then conduct pathway enrichment analysis just once using the combined gene level statistics; by contrast, map ep conducts pathway enrichment analysis for each individual study and then combines the gene set level results to get the overall gene set statistics for a final conclusion. The third method MAPE_I further combines the end results from map eg and map ep for potential improvement in performance. See the top two panels off or the map e diagrams. Undoubtedly, by formalizing these simple and natural ideas, Shen and Tseng (2010) made an initial but important attempt in meta analysis of gene set enrichment. However, such sequential approaches in analysis might cause information loss by just focusing on summary results from the previous steps without using all the expression data available. Further, when there exist various sources of heterogeneities among different datasets, these methods may lack power in detection without explicitly modeling the phenomena. When data from component studies are available, using all data in a fully integrated model based framework is in general more efficient than a sequential approach using summary statistics only. Specifically, the model should be able to account for between study heterogeneities that are widely present in microarray data. Heterogeneities include, among others, varying experiment designs that lead to non-uniform inclusion of genes, unequal sample sizes and data qualities. Moreover, the gene expression measures in component studies may have different means and variances depending on platforms and pre-processing procedures. In this article, we propose a flexible Bayesian model that can offer an appropriate treatment of these problems when aggregating multiple studies to identify enriched gene sets. Our Bayesian method provides a natural way for data synthesis by incorporating model and parameter uncertainties involved in all studies. More importantly, it furnishes an integrated Bayesian framework for jointly modeling gene expression data from multiple studies and gene set information. This will allow researchers to conduct differential expression analysis, gene set enrichment analysis and meta analysis simultaneously, all based on objective Bayesian posterior inference, which may yield more reliable scientific findings than the existing sequential approaches. see for comparison with the map e methods.

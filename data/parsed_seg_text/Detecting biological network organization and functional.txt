We developed a package triplet search to compute relationships within triplets of genes based on Roundup, an orthologous gene database containing 1500 genomes. These relationships, derived from the coevolution of genes, provide valuable information in the detection of biological network organization from the local to the system level, in the inference of protein functions and in the identification of functional orthologs. To run the computation, users need to provide the GI IDs of the genes of interest.

introduction a logic triplet of genes is a set of three genes with a logic relationship; for example, gene c is present in a genome if and only gene a and b are both present (). We developed a method to effectively search for those triplets by incorporating phylogeny balancing into the phylogenetic profiles of triplets. We found logic triplets to be very powerful in the detection of biological network organization and identification of key genes and their protein functions, including adjacent and distant proteins in a pathway, and even interactions among different pathways at the system level (). Here, we provide the programs to search those logic triplets based on a large phylogenetic profile matrix containing 182 bacteria genomes and 87 441 orthologous gene clusters. The matrix was generated through Roundup (), one of the largest gene orthologs databases on the internet, containing 770 bacteria, 55 archaea and 76 eukaryotes. Among possible logic relationships involving three genes, the four types in are most likely to be present in real cellular networks (). In addition, we also developed methods to detect if instead of if and only if (iff ) relationships for the four types, because our study suggested the former might be very common (). Please see 'List * To whom correspondence should be addressed.. The four basic logic relationships and their corresponding network organizations; black dots represent chemical compounds. Type 1: c is present in a genome iff a and b are both present. Type 3: c is present in a genome iff a is present or b is present. Type 5: c is present in a genome iff a is present and b is absent; it means protein b may inhibit enzyme a or c. Type 7: c is present in a genome iff one of either a or b is present. Terminology: iff means if and only if. of iff logic relationship types', 'Search for iff relationships' and 'Search for if relationships' in Supplementary Material for details.

application as our study suggested, logic triplets can be very helpful in the detection of biological network organization at different levels (). For example, a predicted logic triplet, fab h is present iff either fab f or fabB is present, matches exactly to the relationship of the three genes in Escherichia coli. In fatty acid biosynthesis, if fab h is responsible for the initiation of elongation, then the subsequent rounds of elongation can be carried out by either fab f or fabB () (See supplementary for details). In addition, logic triplets reveals the function and network location of putative genes. A triplet tdc e is present iff both y biw and p fld are present indicates that enzymes coded by y biw and p fld function closely with the one coded by tdc e. Indeed, although there is not yet any experimental data on those two genes, other computational studies have suggested such a link as well (). Interestingly, logic triplets are also suggestive of translation regulation. A triplet ll dd is present iff one of either accA or a ccd is present may seem odd at first. In E.coli, ll dd catalyzes the production of pyruvate, which is then converted to act yl coa. accA and a ccd are the two subunits of acetyl coa carboxyl transferase. However, a recent study suggests that a ccd binds to the mRNAs of accA and a ccd to inhibit the translation and that such binding is mutually exclusive with the substrate binding for catalytic activity (). Therefore, the suggestion from the triplet that those two subunits can not coexist in some bacteria is possible. Finally, logic triplets can identify functional orthologs, the gene pairs with similar function but no sequence similarity. For example, an influential paper studied the formation of disulfide bond in bacterial proteins (). While most bacteria contain dsb a and ds bb which function sequentially to form the bond, several major bacterial phyla do not have ds bb. The study finally identified vk or as the functional ortholog of ds bb through experiments. With our method, a strong triplet dsb a is present iff either ds bb or vk or is present would pinpoint the missed gene quickly. In summary, logic triplets are useful in the detection of biological network organization, the inference of protein function and the identification of functional orthologs. Our package triplet search provides the phylogenetic profile matrix of large number of genes across a wide spectrum of bacteria genomes and a group of user friendly programs to search for those triplets. Users can also create customized phylogenetic matrix from 1500 genomes available at our Roundup website (http://roundup.hms.harvard.edu/retrieve/).

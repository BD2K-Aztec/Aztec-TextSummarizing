The r bioconductor package r amigo is an R interface to AmiGO that enables visualization of Gene Ontology (GO) trees. Given a list of GO terms, r amigo uses the AmiGO visualize API to import graphviz dot format files into R, and export these either as images (SVG, PNG) or into Cytoscape for extended network analyses. r amigo provides easy customization of annotation, highlighting of specific GO terms, colouring of terms by p value or export of a simplified summary GO tree. We illustrate r amigo functionalities in a genome wide gene set analysis of prognostic genes in breast cancer. Availability and implementation: r amigo is provided in r bioconductor is open source under the artistic 20 License and is available with a user manual containing installation, operating instructions and tutorials. It requires R version 2.15.0 or higher.

conclusion the r bioconductor package r amigo provides an easy to use R interface to the AmiGO Visualize web server. It provides a simple and elegant way to retrieve Graphviz trees that display hundreds of GO IDs at once and efficiently study clusters or subcomponents of the GO tree in graph form. r amigo provides functions to convert a GO tree into different formats and display it in Cytoscape without leaving the R environment. r amigo is therefore a perfect companion to g sea and GO analyses in R, as it helps one better analyse and interpret the long, and sometimes complex, lists of GO identifiers that these analyses produce.

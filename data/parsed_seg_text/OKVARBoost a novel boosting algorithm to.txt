Motivation: Reverse engineering of gene regulatory networks remains a central challenge in computational systems biology, despite recent advances facilitated by benchmark in silico challenges that have aided in calibrating their performance. A number of approaches using either perturbation (knock-out) or wild type time series data have appeared in the literature addressing this problem, with the latter using linear temporal models. Nonlinear dynamical models are particularly appropriate for this inference task, given the generation mechanism of the time series data. In this study, we introduce a novel nonlinear autoregressive model based on operator valued kernels that simultaneously learns the model parameters, as well as the network structure. Results: A flexible boosting algorithm ok var boost that shares features from L 2 boosting and randomization based algorithms is developed to perform the tasks of parameter learning and network inference for the proposed model. Specifically, at each boosting iteration, a regularized operator valued kernel based Vector AutoRegressive model ok var is trained on a random subnetwork. The final model consists of an ensemble of such models. The empirical estimation of the ensemble models Jacobian matrix provides an estimation of the network structure. The performance of the proposed algorithm is first evaluated on a number of benchmark datasets from the dream 3 challenge and then on real datasets related to the In vivo reverse engineering and Modeling Assessment (IRMA) and t cell networks. The high quality results obtained strongly indicate that it outperforms existing approaches.

introduction the ability to reconstruct cellular networks plays an important role in our understanding of how genes interact with each other and how this information flow coordinates gene regulation and expression in the cell. Gene regulatory networks (GRN) have the potential to provide us with the cellular context of all genes of interest, as well as with a means to identify specific subnetworks that are malfunctioning in a given disease state (). A diverse suite of mathematical tools has been developed and used to infer gene regulatory interactions from spatial and temporal high throughput gene expression data see and references therein). A fair comparison for the relative merits of these methods requires their evaluation on benchmark datasets, which the DREAM (Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods) project () provided. It aims to understand the strengths and the limitations of various algorithms to reconstruct cellular networks from high throughput data (). In addition to the choice of the algorithm, network reconstruction heavily depends on the input data type used. Data that measure the response of the cell to perturbations either by knocking out or silencing genes are particularly useful for such reconstructions because they offer the potential to obtain a detailed view of cellular functions. The downside is that obtaining large scale perturbation data is expensive and relatively few methods have been proposed in the literature to infer regulatory networks from such data due to computational challenges (). Data from time course gene expression experiments have the potential to reveal regulatory interactions as they are induced over time. A number of methods have been used for this task, including dynamic Bayesian networks (), Granger causality models (see s hoja ie and michail id is 2010b and references therein) and state space models (). The first set of methods is computationally demanding, while the latter two use linear dynamics, hence limiting their appeal. Other approaches are based on assumptions about the parametric nature of the dynamical model and resort to time consuming evolutionary algorithms to learn the network ().

This study makes a number of key contributions to the challenging problem of network inference based solely on time course data. It introduces a powerful network inference framework based on nonlinear autoregressive modeling and Jacobian estimation. The proposed framework is rich and flexible, using penalized regression models that coupled with randomized search algorithms, and features of L 2 boosting prove particularly effective as the extensive simulation results attest. The models used require tuning of a number of parameters, and we introduce a novel and generally applicable strategy that combines bootstrapping with stability selection to achieve this goal.

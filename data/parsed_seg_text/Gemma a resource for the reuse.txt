Gemma is a database, analysis software system and web site for genomics data re-use and meta analysis. Currently, Gemma contains analyzed data from over 3300 expression profiling studies, yielding hundreds of millions of differential expression results and coexpression patterns (correlated expression) for retrieval and visual-ization. With optional registration users can save their own data and securely share it with other users. Web services and integration with third party resources further increase the scope of the tools, which include a Cytoscape plugin.

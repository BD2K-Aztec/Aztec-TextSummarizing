surv jam da (Survival prediction by joint analysis of microarray data) is an R package that utilizes joint analysis of microarray gene expression data to predict patients survival and risk assessment. Joint analysis can be performed by merging datasets or meta analysis to increase the sample size and to improve survival prognosis. The prognosis performance derived from the combined datasets can be assessed to determine which feature selection approach, joint analysis method and bias estimation provide the most robust prognosis for a given set of datasets. Availability: The surv jam da package is available at the Comprehensive R Archive Network, http://cran.r

introduction the surv jam da package was developed for survival prediction and risk assessment based on microarray data. It allows to jointly analyze the datasets through data merging and meta analysis. Data merging combines the data into one set prior to their analysis, whereas meta analysis integrates only the results. In addition to different joint analysis methods, surv jam da contains various feature selection approaches and bias estimation techniques which enable the user to determine the combination of which methods provides the most robust prediction for a given set of datasets. A few other R packages like ipd meta () and surv comp () have been created for joint analysis, that are more specifically, related to meta analysis of censored data with time to event outcome.

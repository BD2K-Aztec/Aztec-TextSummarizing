Motivation: The Illumina Infinium 450 k DNA Methylation bead chip is a prime candidate technology for epi genome wide Association Studies e was. However, a difficulty associated with these bead arrays is that probes come in two different designs, characterized by widely different DNA methylation distributions and dynamic range, which may bias downstream analyses. A key statistical issue is therefore how best to adjust for the two different probe designs. Results: Here we propose a novel model based intra array normal-ization strategy for 450 k data, called bmi q (Beta MIxture Quantile dilation), to adjust the beta values of type 2 design probes into a statistical distribution characteristic of type 1 probes. The strategy involves application of a three state beta mixture model to assign probes to methylation states, subsequent transformation of probabilities into quantiles and finally a methylation dependent dilation transformation to preserve the monotonicity and continuity of the data. We validate our method on cell line data, fresh frozen and paraffin embedded tumour tissue samples and demonstrate that bmi q compares favourably with two competing methods. Specifically, we show that bmi q improves the robustness of the normalization procedure, reduces the technical variation and bias of type 2 probe values and successfully eliminates the type 1 enrichment bias caused by the lower dynamic range of type 2 probes. bmi q will be useful as a preprocessing step for any study using the Illumina Infinium 450 k platform. Availability: bmi q is freely available from

introduction in the past few years, the field of epi genomics has risen to prominence (). epi genomics not only offers an improved understanding of fundamental biological processes such as cellular differentiation and early embryogenesis, but is also widely recognized to be key in understanding the pathogenesis of complex genetic diseases like cancer (). One particular epigenetic mark of interest is DNA methylation. Indeed, DNA methylation markers have been proposed as early detection, diagnostic and prognostic markers in a wide range of different diseases (). Underpinning this increased interest in epi genomics are significant advances in bead array technology, which now allow routine measurement of DNA methylation at over thousands of CpG dinucleotides (). Among these, the Illumina Infinium 450 k Human Methylation bead chip offers both scalability and coverage (4480 000 probes) and is thus suitable for epi genome wide Association Studies e was (). A key statistical issue with the Illumina 450 k bead chip is that probes come in two different designs, which causes the methylation values derived from these two designs to exhibit widely different distributions (). Indeed, type 2 probes are typically characterized by a much lower dynamic range compared with type 1 probes, even after adjustment for differences in biological characteristics such as CpG density (). Comparison with bi sulphite pyrosequencing data further showed that type 2 probe values are biased and generally less reproducible (). To correct for this bias, a peak based correction (PBC) method was proposed () which normalise s type 2 design probes so as to render them comparable with type 1 probes. Making the statistical distributions of type 1 and type 2 probes comparable is important for several reasons. Not doing so may introduce an enrichment bias towards type 1 probes when ranking probes in supervised analyses, as the dynamic range of type 1 probes is significantly higher. Moreover, methods that seek to determine differentially methylated regions () also assume that probes within these regions are comparable and thus one would want to avoid any sources of technical variation within them. Finally, one would wish to apply unsupervised dimensional reduction algorithms () and classification algorithms () to one single dataset, and not separately to two different assays. Although the PBC method was validated in one dataset () and has now been implemented in a pipeline for 450 k data (), two recent studies have exposed potential problems with PBC, specially when *To whom correspondence should be addressed  The Author 2012.

In fact, as noted in these studies, PBC breaks down when the methylation density distribution does not exhibit well defined peaks modes. Hence, both studies proposed subset quantile normalization methods (SQN and SWAN) to correct for the type 2 bias and which avoid the pitfalls of PBC (). In this work, we show that PBC often leads to discontinuities ('holes') in the type 2 density distribution. To address this problem, we here propose a novel mixture model based normalization algorithm, called Beta MIxture Quantile dilation bmi q. We subject bmi q to a rigorous evaluation using numerous independent datasets and using a number of different evaluation criteria to assess its robustness and performance. Specifically, we assess bmi q in terms of reducing (i) the technical variance, (ii) the type 2 bias, (iii) and the above mentioned type 1 enrichment bias. We further benchmark bmi q against PBC and SWAN. For assessing technical variance and to allow a comprehensive comparison of bmi q to pbc swan across many datasets, we use in addition to replicates, a novel evaluation framework based on using adjacent type 1type2 probe pairs within probe clusters, a framework which we show leads to consistent and robust conclusions across 10 independent datasets. We demonstrate that, overall, bmi q compares favourably to PBC and SWAN.

discussion in this work we have presented a novel mixture model based algorithm bmi q for correcting the bias associated with type 2 probe values in 450 k studies. Confirming the observations) in the density distributions (), which motivated our quest to find a more robust algorithm. We have shown that bmi q improves the robustness and can successfully normalize the type 2 distribution, avoiding the appearance of such 'holes' (). Moreover, bmi q successfully matches the tail ends of the type 1 and type 2 distributions, while faithfully preserving the proportions of unmethylated and methylated probes within each of the two designs. To further test bmi q we used data on technical replicates (to show that it reduces technical variability) and matched BPS data (to show that it reduces the bias of type 2 probe values). Using these criteria, we have seen that bmi q leads to significant improvements, similar to the improvements noted for PBC (). In relation to these evaluation criteria, it is worth pointing out that bmi q was compared with PBC on samples with well defined type 1 methylation peaks, i.e. on data that were used to develop PBC itself. Hence, it is likely that an evaluation of technical reproducibility (using replicates) and type 2 value bias (using matched BPS data) on data where the methylated type 1 peaks are less well defined would favour bmi q over PBC. However, we did not have access to technical replicates or matched BPS data in the other specific datasets considered here. Therefore, in order to further assess bmi q we devised a supervised framework across three independent datasets to objectively compare the algorithms in their ability to reduce the expected enrichment bias of type 1 probes. First, we showed that if no design normalization is performed then there is indeed an enrichment bias towards type 1 probes, even when adjusted for CpG density (). We also showed that in two datasets, PBC over corrected the type 2 data, leading to an overinflated dynamic range, thus favouring type 2 probes and causing an 'overshooting' of the enrichment scores, reflected by a significant under enrichment of type 1 probes (and C). In contrast, bmi q successfully avoided any type 1type2 enrichment bias in all three datasets, indicative of an improved normalization of type 2 values (). We should point out that the over correction of type 2 values and the associated overinflated dynamic range caused by PBC is consistent with the presence of 'holes' in the hemi methylated region of the type 2 density distribution. Thus, with PBC there is an artificial expulsion of data points from the hemi methylated region to the unmethylated and/ or methylated extremes. In a further assessment of bmi q we conducted a detailed spatial analysis of DNA methylation at the level of probe clusters across 10 independent datasets. By carefully analysing adjacent type 1type2 probe pairs, we observed that PBC can often over correct or suppress the data (in some cases inducing abnormally large 30% changes in methylation), in contrast to bmi q which normalized type 2 values in a way that rendered them more consistent with the values of neighbouring type 1 probes (). Interestingly, bmi q also appeared to outperform SWAN (), which is part of the popular and widely used min fi package (). Of note, the reduction in technical variance achieved by bmi q was not at the expense of a lower biological signal ().

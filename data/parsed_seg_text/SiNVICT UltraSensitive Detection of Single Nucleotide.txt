Motivation: Successful development and application of precision oncology approaches require robust elucidation of the genomic landscape of a patients cancer and, ideally, the ability to monitor therapy induced genomic changes in the tumour in an inexpensive and minimally invasive manner. Thanks to recent advances in sequencing technologies, liquid biopsy, the sampling of patients bodily fluids such as blood and urine, is considered as one of the most promising approaches to achieve this goal. In many cancer patients, and especially those with advanced metastatic disease, deep sequencing of circulating cell free DNA cf dna obtained from patients blood yields a mixture of reads originating from the normal DNA and from multiple tumour subclones called circulating tumour DNA or ct dna. The ct dna cf dna ratio as well as the proportion of ct dna originating from specific tumour subclones depend on multiple factors, making comprehensive detection of mutations difficult, especially at early stages of cancer. Furthermore, sensitive and accurate detection of sn vs and indels from cf dna is constrained by several factors such as the sequencing errors and PCR artifacts, and mapping errors related to repeat regions within the genome. In this paper, we introduce sin vict a computational method that increases the sensitivity and specificity of SNV and in del detection at very low variant allele frequencies. sin vict has the capability to handle multiple sequencing platforms with different error properties; it minimises false positives resulting from mapping errors and other technology specific artifacts including strand bias and low base quality at read ends. sin vict also has the capability to perform time series analysis, where samples from a patient sequenced at multiple time points are jointly examined to report locations of interest where there is a possibility that certain clones were wiped out by some treatment while some subclones gained selective advantage. Results: We tested sin vict on simulated data as well as prostate cancer cell lines and cf dna obtained from castration resistant prostate cancer patients. On both simulated and biological data, sin vict was able to detect sn vs and indels with variant allele percentages as low as 0.5%. The lowest amounts of total DNA used for the biological data where sn vs and indels could be detected with very high sensitivity were 2.5ng on the Ion Torrent platform and 10ng on Illumina. With increased sequencing and mapping accuracy, sin vict might be utilised in clinical settings, making it possible to track the progress of point mutations and indels that are associated with resistance to cancer therapies and provide patients personalised treatment. We also compared sin vict with other popular SNV callers such as mute ct VarScan2, and free bayes. Our results show that sin vict performs better than these tools in most cases and allows further data exploration such as time series analysis on cf dna sequencing data.

introduction one of the most promising areas of precision oncology is the development of custom targeted therapies tailored for a patient. Successful development and efficient application of such therapies require efficient and inexpensive identification and monitoring of therapy induced changes in a patient's tumour DNA. Unfortunately, especially in advanced stage cancers, the main cause of cancer's morbidity and mortality is the development of multiple metastatic lesions, often not easily accessible for tissue sampling. For example, in prostate cancer more than 90% of metastases occur in bone and or deep lymph nodes (). biopsy ing such sites is associated with significant morbidity for the patients and thus is not commonly performed. The existence of circulating cell free DNA cf dna in mammalian blood has been known since 1948 (). cf dna is thought to be released from the dying necrotic apoptotic cells both normal and tumour, as has been shown in 1994 when mutated RAS gene fragments were detected in the blood of cancer patients see (). The non-specific mechanism of generating cf dna results in integral representation of all tumour DNA of a patient subject to sampling variability and, possibly, to tumour's access to blood stream. In an earlier study, for example, we observed the presence of multiple mutated forms of AR (androgen receptor) gene in cf dna of patients with castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) () that can be best explained by the presence of multiple subpopulations of cancer cells in each patient's body. This integral representation of multiple tumour foci subclones provides an important advantage to the use of blood plasma as a source of tumour derived DNA. Unfortunately, the presence of both normal and tumour DNA in a patient's blood poses significant challenges to the analysis of cf dna sequence data. To make matters worse, tumour DNA is many times derived from multiple subclones and is thus highly heterogeneous. An earlier study we performed on mutations in CRPC patients () demonstrated that cf dna comprised an average of 4.7% (IQR 1 4.5%) of ct dna based on the proportion of reads with mutations in AR. There are several somatic and germline mutation callers that were developed to find single nucleotide variants sn vs as well as indels within a given population using w gss (Whole Genome Shotgun Sequencing), as well as to detect specific variants in a patient's genome through sampling multiple loci from the same patient. Examples include g atk (), VarScan2 (), free bayes (), str elka (), mute ct (), and others. Most of these tools either use a frequentist or Bayesian approach to estimate the probability of a locus being an actual mutation instead of being a false positive caused by noise (due to sequencing or mapping errors). Among them, VarScan2 uses several heuristics to reduce the size of the candidate set and then applies some statistical test like Fisher's Exact on tumour benign pairs to call somatic mutations. It also provides post-processing capability to enable further filtering based on additional factors such as strand bias. Other tools such as free bayes mute ct and str elka make use of the prior and posterior probabilities of a location being mutated in a Bayesian context in order to call mutations. Unfortunately, these tools are not designed to work with (i) sequencing data from patients at multiple time points, (ii) very high read depth (e.g. 20k-30k average, up to 90k and possibly more in the future), or, (iii) extremely low dilutions (can be as low as around 0.01% variant allele percentage ()), or, (iv) samples with high intra tumour heterogeneity, or, (v) batches of samples that suffer from systematic noise. In addition, ct dna levels can also be below the analytical sensitivity of existing ct dna detection approaches in patients with localized disease and in patients that have received therapy (). In order to address problems mentioned above, we introduce sin vict a computational tool that can handle very high read depth and very low dilutions. sin vict can be run on a single tumour sample, on a batch of multiple tumour samples, or on multiple samples from a single patient sequenced at multiple time points. This feature allows sin vict to process samples from a single patient in multiple cancer stages, as well as a group of different patients that are being sequenced and analyzed at the same time. In cases where these samples have similar disease progression and dilution levels, sin vict can make use of the signal to noise ratio of the batch (explained later) to characterise the systematic noise and try to reduce the number of false positives due to the non-uniformity of noise across the sequenced regions. We evaluated robustness of sin vict on data obtained by two sequencing platforms with distinct error rates (0.1% substitution in Illumina; 1% in del in ion torrent (), which were applied to the same tumour samples. Our experiments indicate that sin vict is highly sensitive to calls on data generated by both sequencing platforms. For example, three previously validated AR (Androgen Receptor gene) mutations () in a mixture of 22RV1 and 49C cell lines which were used as reference in ampli seq 2 calibration and Illumina calibration experiments were detected with almost identical sensitivity by sin vict. sin vict was also able to detect previously validated mutations successfully from actual cf dna sequencing data obtained from castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients. These findings suggest that sin vict might be utilised in the analysis of deep sequencing cancer data obtained from both Ion Torrent and Illumina sequencing technologies. As importantly, sin vict addresses a unique problem and is not comparable to existing popular SNV and in del callers (e.g. g atk particularly because such tools typically process a fraction of the reads in datasets with high sequencing depth since multiple occurrences of identical reads are marked as PCR duplicates. However, identical reads are to be expected in deep amplicon sequencing and this is not necessarily an artifact of PCR.

conclusions in vict is a highly accurate and sensitive tool for detection of sn vs and short indels in circulating tumour DNA at very low variant allele percentages. Mutation detection with high read depth is often difficult due to sequencing errors getting amplified with the Amplicon technology used in most deep sequencing platforms. sin vict is capable of filtering mutation calls by several parameters such as the minimum read depth, strand bias, etc. We provide more details on the effect of filters on the experiments performed in Section 3 in Supplementary Table 11. sin vict is also highly customisable, allowing the user to fine tune several parameters to achieve the desired level of sensitivity and specificity. time series analysis capabilities of sin vict might be utilised to gain insight to how certain drug treatments affect the overall clonal composition for a patient. Results obtained from experiments on simulated data suggest that at variant allele percentages below 0.5%, even increasing the read depth indefinitely will not help with the calls unless the sequencing errors are reduced. Results obtained from the cell line experiments might allow us to speculate that 2.5ng for ampli seq and 10ng for Illumina are the safest amounts of DNA (among our calibration samples) from which a set of reliable calls can be obtained at all dilutions mentioned before.

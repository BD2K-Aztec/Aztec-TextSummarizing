Motivation: Antibodies or immunoglobulins are proteins of paramount importance in the immune system. They are extremely relevant as diagnostic, biotechnological and therapeutic tools. Their modular structure makes it easy to re-engineer them for specific purposes. Short of undergoing a trial and error process, these experiments, as well as others, need to rely on an understanding of the specific determinants of the antibody binding mode. Results: In this article, we present a method to identify, on the basis of the antibody sequence alone, which residues of an antibody directly interact with its cognate antigen. The method, based on the random forest automatic learning techniques, reaches a recall and specificity as high as 80% and is implemented as a free and easy to use server, named prediction of Antibody Contacts. We believe that it can be of great help in redesign experiments as well as a guide for molecular docking experiments. The results that we obtained also allowed us to dissect which features of the antibody sequence contribute most to the involvement of specific residues in binding to the antigen.

introduction the past two decades have seen monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy come to age. With 430 molecules approved for clinical practice and hundreds currently being tested, mAbs are rapidly emerging as one of the most important classes of biological therapeutics. Despite their benefits, mABs obtained from both human and xenogeneic sources have some deficiencies, such as short in vivo life, low stability and high chances to raise an immunogenic reaction in patients. To overcome these hurdles, a number of strategies based on genetic recombination have been developed and optimized, which allow the modification and improvement of almost all the clinically relevant aspects of an antibody molecule but require expensive and time demanding trial and error experimental procedures, a process that can be speeded up by the understanding of the structure and binding mode of the specific antibody (). The antibody molecule, with few exceptions, contains one or more tetramers of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, the heavy and the light chains. Each chain consists of homologous domains, two for the light chain (one variable and one constant domain) and four or more for the heavy chain (one variable and three or more constant domains). All the domains share a similar tertiary structure, the so called immunoglobulin fold, which is characterized by two anti-parallel beta sheets. The antigen binding site (ABS) is mainly composed of six loops, three from the light and three from the heavy chain [also known as the hypervariable (HV) loops]. In a seminal study on antibody sequences (), such large variability was exploited to correctly define these HV sequence stretches as the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) in antibody recognition. Later studies () confirmed that this definition largely overlaps with the structurally based definition of the ABS. A number of other biological mechanisms are in place to increase the sequence diversity of antibody regions containing the ABS to enlarge the size of the antibody repertoire, and therefore the number of different antigens that can be targeted by the immune system (Di;). Analyses of the rapidly growing number of antibody crystal structures in complex with their antigens pointed out that, even though almost all the intermolecular interactions are made by residues in the CDR (), the specific interaction pattern of each antibody depends on a subset of residues within or outside the CDR regions that are important either to maintain the correct three dimensional (3D) conformation () or to specify the physicochemical environment of the ABS. Knowing the role played by a specific residue is a key aspect in antibody rational design and engineering. This information can be inferred by analyzing the 3D structure of the antibody molecule or, when the latter is not available, by building and analyzing its 3D model. Modeling of antibody structures is a field that has attracted much attention, and available methods can produce models of very good accuracy (). It should be noted here that antibody structure prediction still has pitfalls, mainly as far as the prediction of the conformation of the third HV loop of the heavy chain is concerned (). Despite the abundance of methods specifically devoted to the prediction and analysis of antibodies (), few tools are available to provide information about the para top e i.e. the subset of residues that contact the antigen. para to me () is a recently published online tool for *To whom correspondence should be addressed this is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/), which permits non-commercial re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

However, para to me does not provide any information on the specific residues that are directly involved in the binding, on the type of interaction (hydrogen bond, hydrophobic and other non-bonded interactions) or on the atoms involved in the interaction (main chain, side chain or both). This information is of relevance for any type of antibody engineering experiment, such as in silico maturation. To overcome this problem, we developed prediction of Antibody Contacts pro abc a web server for predicting which residues of an antibody are involved in recognizing its cognate antigen. It is based on a machine learning method trained on sequence and sequence derived features. Starting from the antibody sequence alone, pro abc estimates, for each residue in its sequence, the probability that it interacts with the cognate antigen. Three different types of interaction are considered and predicted separately (hydrogen bond, hydrophobic and other non-bonded interactions). The results are displayed in an intuitive manner allowing an easy yet comprehensive examination of the residues that could directly interact with the antigen (also known as specificity determining residues). pro abc also builds a 3D model of the antibody, in which residues are colored according to their contact probability. The server is available at http://www.biocomputing.it/pro ABC.

Cloud computing offers low cost and highly flexible opportunities in bioinformatics. Its potential has already been demonstrated in high throughput sequence data analysis. pathway based or gene set analysis of expression data has received relatively less attention. We developed a gene set analysis algorithm for biomarker identification in the cloud. The resulting tool, yun be is ready to use on Amazon Web Services. Moreover, here we compare its performance to those obtained with desktop and computing cluster solutions. Availability and implementation: yun be is open source and freely accessible within the Amazon Elastic map reduce service at s3n

introduction the complexity and cost associated with recent advances in high throughput 'omic' technologies have made cloud computing a cost effective and powerful resource for bioinformatics. Existing platforms, such as those offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS), provide the computing environment, including CPUs, storage, processing memory, networking and operating systems, required to deploy computationally expensive algorithms and applications. Such environments allow users to configure and exploit resources on a 'pay as you use' basis (). Although cloud computing applications are increasingly being made available for high throughput DNA sequencing data, there is a need for publicly available algorithms that can enable other translational biomedical research applications, such as large scale gene set analysis of expression data (). In this context, expression data of thousands of genes are mapped to biologically relevant sets of genes, e.g. curated biological pathways, and differential expression of such gene sets is estimated across phenotypes. The objective of our research is 2-fold: (i) to develop a cloud compute version of a published gene set analysis algorithm (); and (ii) to perform a comparative analysis of performance across different computing platforms.

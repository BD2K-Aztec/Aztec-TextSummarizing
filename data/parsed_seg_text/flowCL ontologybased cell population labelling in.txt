Motivation: Finding one or more cell populations of interest, such as those correlating to a specific disease, is critical when analysing flow cytometry data. However, labelling of cell populations is not well defined, making it difficult to integrate the output of algorithms to external knowledge sources. Results: We developed flow cl a software package that performs semantic labelling of cell populations based on their surface markers and applied it to labelling of the Federation of Clinical Immunology Societies Human Immunology Project Consortium lyo plate populations as a use case. Conclusion: By providing automated labelling of cell populations based on their immunopheno-type, flow cl allows for unambiguous and reproducible identification of standardized cell types.

introduction both flow cytometry (FCM) and mass cytometry are used to identify one or more cell populations of interest, such as those correlating with a disease phenotype. Cell types can be grouped by their particular combinations of markers, or immunophenotype. Despite progress made towards standardization of FCM assays (), the lack of a standard labelling strategy hampers data integration when trying to match gating data resulting from various V C The Author 2014.

The cell ontology (CL) was developed to represent cell types relevant to biology. A recent revision () specifically focused on extending coverage of the CL by improving the representation of haematopoeitic cell types, asserting those cell types in a single inheritance hierarchy and adding logical restrictions to describe their immunophenotype s. However, multiple issues arose when we attempted to use the CL for labelling of cell types derived from FCM data. The definition of 'mature T cell' (obo:CL_0002419; " obo: " is an abbreviation for http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/) mentions that it has plasma membrane part some 'T cell receptor complex' (obo:GO_0042101), which itself has part the CD3 marker (obo:PR_000001018), requiring complex reasoning to infer that 'mature T cell' has part some CD3. Additionally, when trying to identify CD3 cells, FCM experimenters are in fact targeting cd3 epsilon (obo:PR_000001020), which is itself a subunit of the CD3 molecule described in the CL. As a consequence, while the CL encompasses information about surface markers, its manual exploitation can be challenging and may require multiple inferences along multiple axes, which is neither optimal nor sustainable with the increase in size of datasets. To address these challenges, we developed flow cl a software package that enables researchers to unambiguously label their cell populations based on their immunophenotype using the CL. We also improved CL to enhance its utility for automated labelling of cell populations.

conclusion decoupling the knowledge representation and the software code allows for greater flexibility for extension and updates. As the CL development proceeds, flow cl automatically remains up-to-date with the latest scientific knowledge. Additionally, the information added to the CL is immediately available for the scientific community, independently of the flow cl development or the HIPC project. By providing automated labelling of cell populations based on their immunophenotype, flow cl allows researchers to report results using cell type labels. Future work includes validation on other datasets and extending the CL with an assay based representation of cell types.

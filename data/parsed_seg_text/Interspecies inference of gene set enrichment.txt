Motivation: Translating findings in rodent models to human models has been a cornerstone of modern biology and drug development. However, in many cases, a naive extrapolation between the two species has not succeeded. As a result, clinical trials of new drugs sometimes fail even after considerable success in the mouse or rat stage of development. In addition to in vitro studies, inter-species translation requires analytical tools that can predict the enriched gene sets in human cells under various stimuli from corresponding measurements in animals. Such tools can improve our understanding of the underlying biology and optimize the allocation of resources for drug development. Results: We developed an algorithm to predict differential gene set enrichment as part of the sbv IMPROVER (systems biology verification in Industrial Methodology for Process Verification in Research) Species Translation Challenge, which focused on phospho proteomic and transcript omic measurements of normal human bronchial epithe-lial nh be primary cells under various stimuli and corresponding measurements in rat nr be primary cells. We find that gene sets exhibit a higher inter-species correlation compared with individual genes, and are potentially more suited for direct prediction. Furthermore, in contrast to a similar cross species response in protein phosphorylation states 5 and 25 min after exposure to stimuli, gene set enrichment 6 h after exposure is significantly different in nh be cells compared with nr be cells. In spite of this difference, we were able to develop a robust algorithm to predict gene set activation in nh be with high accuracy using simple analytical methods.

introduction although rodents diverged from primates around 75 million years ago, the common origin of eukaryotic multicellular organisms suggests that basic mechanisms in all complex life should be governed by similar pathways and principles. This simple observation has led to the successful use of in vivo rat and mouse models to understand biological mechanisms in humans. In particular, the initial phases of drug development rely heavily on knowledge gained from in vitro and in vivo experiments on model organisms, primarily from rat and mouse models. However, rats or mice often differ from humans in their response to stimuli (). An open problem in the field is to understand these differences, especially those that affect mechanisms of pathway activation. There remains a continuing need to develop better analytical methods and modeling techniques to translate information from in vitro rat mouse studies to accurate models of pathway activation in humans. In addition to response differences at the tissue level, one also expects differences at the cellular level in rat and human cells subject to the same stimulus. Part of the difference in cellular response is probably because of changes in the promoter and gene sequence that alter cellular pathways. This would result in changes in expression levels, thresholds, reaction rates and activation times resulting in differences in the way a stimulus may activate a given pathway. For instance, mouse embryonic stem cells self renew when the LIF/Stat-3 signaling pathway is activated, but human embryonic stem cells do not (); both cell types, however, respond similarly to Wnt activation (). Similarly, mouse and human leukocytes respond differently in terms of their gene expression to stimuli that induce inflammation (). In general, one expects that there may be significant differences between species in the way single genes get activated. However, the regulation of collections of genes that act in concert (gene sets) to activate pathways, or respond to activation of a pathway, might be expected to be more similar ().

The sbv IMPROVER (systems biology verification in Industrial Methodology for Process Verification in Research) Challenges are an industry initiative focused on verifying the strengths and weaknesses of systems biology methods on a variety of biological problems by tapping the 'Wisdom of Crowds' (). As a part of this goal, the organizers held the Species Translation Challenge (STC), a challenge specifically focused on translating biological responses observed in rat to human, given the same set of perturbations in comparable cell lines (). This challenge allowed teams of researchers, including us, to compare the performance of different methods to translate results within and between species. In the specific challenge described here, the so called Inter-Species Pathway Perturbation Challenge sub challenge 3 or SC3), we used phosphorylation level and gene expression data from normal rat bronchial epithelial nr be and normal human bronchial epithelial nh be cells to develop a predictive model of the activation of pathways gene sets in humans from measurements in rats. The model was trained on a set of stimuli and tested on data from the same experimental design using different stimuli. In the training data, we were provided with measurements on both rat and human cells, whereas in the test data, we were provided only with measurements in rat. The challenge was to develop a model on the training data and use it to predict pathway activation in human cells using the rat test data. The results from each team were compared with a 'gold standard' dataset on human cells using the same stimuli. Our method, which we describe below, was judged to be the best performer in this sub challenge. The outline of the article is as follows. First, we describe how the raw data were processed to identify statistically significant signals. Next, we discuss inter-species correlations (human and rat) for both gene sets and gene expression level data. In principle, there are two possible strategies available to predict differential expression (enrichment) of human gene sets from the rat data (see): (i) one possibility is to use a direct method, where the human gene set enrichment scores are learned from those in rat training data (Rat a human A) and then applied to the rat test data gene set scores (Rat B) to predict human gene set scores; (ii) the second possibility is to use an indirect method, where human gene expression levels are learned from gene expression levels in rat in the training data and applied to the Rat B gene expression test data to get human expression predictions. Finally, the predicted Human B gene expression levels could be used in a gene set enrichment algorithm g sea () to predict human gene set scores. Although we attempted both methods, for our final prediction, we used only the direct method. Below, we outline our reasons for choosing the direct method followed by a detailed description of the prediction algorithm we used for our predictions.

discussion we devised an algorithm to predict differential gene set enrichment in nh be primary cells under various stimuli from measurements of nr be primary cells exposed to the same stimuli. As a part of our analysis, we computed the MI between the differential enrichment of the corresponding gene sets and also ortholog pairs of genes in the two species. MI objectively quantifies the predictive power of the rat data without a need to assume an underlying model. It also determines the level of difficulty of the prediction; higher MI naively implies that inference should be easier. We found that 6 h after exposure, gene set enrichment in nh be is significantly different than in nr be despite almost identical response in protein phosphorylation states measured 5 and 25 min after exposure. As phosphorylation happens close to the beginning of the signaling cascade, it is expected that the response at a fixed early time point should be more conserved between the two species. As the signal is transmitted further along the signaling pathway, slight differences between the two species can result in divergence of their response at later time points. This is principally manifested in the inverse relationship observed between the human and rat gene set that had the highest MI (DNA replication gene set). To rule out a bias from g sea analysis as the cause, we computed the MI directly for each pair of ortholog genes. The ortholog gene pair with the highest MI (DPP4) was also negatively correlated in expression levels between the two species. How can a gene set be differentially expressed in the nh be cells when they are not in rat cells (and vice versa) under the same stimuli? One possibility is that this reflects an evolutionary divergence of the particular pathway in the two species. However, this is unlikely, as it would imply that biological modules are completely anti correlated in function in nh be cells compared with nr be cells. A more likely explanation is that the discrepancy stems from a time difference between rat and human in how the phosphor protein activates downstream genes. It reflects the limitation of the measurement process used in this challenge, where gene expression levels were measured at the arbitrary time point top Training the algorithm to predict gene set g in human under stimulus s. First, represent the rat NES scores under the 26 stimuli of set A as 26 points in n dimensional space, where N is the number of principal components used. The figure shows a diagram for N = 2. We used N = 8 for the actual prediction. Label each of the 26 points as either 0 (off) or 1 (on) based on the human FDR value of gene set g under the same 26 stimuli. Next, identify the hyperplane that best separates the two types of labels. (Bottom) Predicting gene set g under stimulus s of set B. Introduce a new point corresponding to the reduced representation of rat NES score under stimulus s. Depending on which side of the hyperplane the point falls on and its separation distance from the plane, classify as either 0 and 1 and associate a statistical significance the algorithm described in this article is that of Team 50. The predicted response to the 26 stimuli of set B is compared with the measured response using the a up r Pearson correlation coefficient and BAC. For details on these metrics and the scoring see (). Asterisk denotes the author's team number in the challenge the blue line corresponds to correlating the prediction to the bin a rized known FDR values (ON when FDR50.25) and the red line to correlation with the FDR values converted to a continuous scale (using 1-FDR value) of 6 h in both species. It is conceivable that the pathways exhibit non-trivial dynamics following activation inactivation by the same stimulus. During the response, some genes might oscillate or transiently be under expressed following a spike in expression levels (). In fact, DNA replication genes are normally tuned to the cell cycle; related pathways such as p53 are known to exhibit such oscillation (). If the phase or the period of these oscillations is different in rat and human, a snapshot measurement can potentially exhibit anti correlations. This would explain why we find that anti correlated pathways have the highest MI because they are the ones that are oscillating after being triggered by the stimulus. To validate and further understand the role of such dynamics, the microarray analysis would need to be repeated for a number of time points following stimulation. A time series of the gene expression levels would then elucidate the differences between the dynamics of the response in the two species, shedding more light on the underlying biology. Despite the low MI between the gene sets of the two species, we were able to make non-trivial predictions of the response of nh be cells based on measurements in nr be cells, which were verified experimentally (). The inference algorithm relied only on the state of the gene sets. We found that the individual ortholog genes did not exhibit significantly higher MI. It is plausible that biological modules and pathways are better conserved across the two species whereas expression levels of individual genes are not. More measurements are needed to verify this claim. Predicting coarse grained modules at various levels of hierarchy could be more biologically relevant for species translation, as opposed to predicting expression levels of individual genes or post-translational state of individual proteins. We relied heavily on pc a of the gene sets to make the inference. pc a served two broad purposes. First, it allowed us to eliminate noise in the gene set enrichment scores. More importantly, it enabled us to naturally account for intra-species correlations between gene sets. By linearly combining the gene sets, we could predict enrichment of gene sets in human that had almost no correlation with their counterpart in the rat but were well correlated with other human gene sets. We did not explicitly consider possible correlations in the response between different stimuli from their underlying biology, as the inference was made with no knowledge of the test stimuli. Inter-species inference of gene expression is potentially more difficult than inter-species inference of protein phosphorylation states (), and intra-species prediction of gene expression from protein activation (). Nevertheless, the methods described here could infer differential gene set enrichment in human epithelial lung cells from proteomic and transcript omic data on rat epithelial cells, with reasonable accuracy. Such a framework is potentially useful to translate measurements in rats to humans, with therapeutic applications in drug development, or for understanding basic biological mechanisms.

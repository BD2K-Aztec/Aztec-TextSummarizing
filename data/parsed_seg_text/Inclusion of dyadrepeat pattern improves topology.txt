Accurate topology prediction of transmembrane b barrels is still an open question. Here, we present BOCTOPUS2, an improved topology prediction method for transmembrane b barrels that can also identify the barrel domain, predict the topology and identify the orientation of residues in transmembrane b strands. The major novelty of BOCTOPUS2 is the use of the dyad repeat pattern of lipid and pore facing residues observed in transmembrane b barrels. In a cross validation test on a benchmark set of 42 proteins, BOCTOPUS2 predicts the correct topology in 69% of the proteins, an improvement of more than 10% over the best earlier method b octopus and in addition, it produces significantly fewer erroneous predictions on non transmembrane b barrel proteins.

introduction transmembrane b barrels t mbs are located in the outer membranes of bacteria, chloroplasts and mitochondria and are involved in transport of substrates across the cell membrane. Also, they are key components of translocation complexes. Bacterial t mbs consist of an even number of anti-parallel b strands that are surrounded by long outer loops and short inner loops. Eukaryotic t mbs can have an odd number of strands. The residues located in transmembrane b strands follow a dyad repeat pattern, where alternating residues face the lipids and the pore region (), respectively. b octopus (), a previously published two stage TMB topology predictor, did not predict the lipid pore facing orientation of residues in the transmembrane b strands but BOCTOPUS2 does. The use of this information improves topology predictions.

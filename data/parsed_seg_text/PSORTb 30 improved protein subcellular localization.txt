Motivation: psort b has remained the most precise bacterial protein subcellular localization (SCL) predictor since it was first made available in 2003. However, the recall needs to be improved and no accurate SCL predictors yet make predictions for archaea, nor differentiate important localization subcategories, such as proteins targeted to a host cell or bacterial hyper structures organelles. Such improvements should preferably be encompassed in a freely available web based predictor that can also be used as a standalone program. Results: We developed psort b version 3.0 with improved recall, higher proteome scale prediction coverage, and new refined localization subcategories. It is the first SCL predictor specifically geared for all prokaryotes, including archaea and bacteria with a typical membrane cell wall topologies. It features an improved standalone program, with a new batch results delivery system complementing its web interface. We evaluated the most accurate SCL predictors using 5-fold cross validation plus we performed an independent proteomics analysis, showing that psort b 3.0 is the most accurate but can benefit from being complemented by Proteome Analyst predictions.

introduction computational prediction of bacterial protein subcellular localization (SCL) provides a quick and inexpensive means for gaining insight into protein function, verifying experimental results, annotating newly sequenced bacterial genomes, detecting potential cell surface secreted drug targets, as well as identifying biomarkers for microbes. In recent years, this area of computational research has achieved an impressive level of precision (), allowing SCL prediction tools to be reliably integrated into automated proteome annotation pipelines and to complement analyses of high throughput proteomics experiments. psort b version 2.0 (), the most precise bacterial SCL prediction software (), was introduced in 2005, and has been widely used for the SCL prediction of individual proteins as well as for whole proteomes. It generates prediction results for five major localizations for gram negative bacteria (cytoplasmic, inner membrane, periplasmic, outer membrane and extracellular) and four localizations for gram positive bacteria (cytoplasmic, cytoplasmic membrane, cell wall and extracellular). Since then, numerous SCL prediction tools have been created for bacteria using a variety of machine learning algorithms: CELLO version 2.0 () uses multilayered support vector machines (SVMs); slp local predicts s cls based on local composition and distance frequencies of amino acid groups (); PSL101 makes predictions based on amino acid compositions coupled with structural feature conservation s (); and psl doc bases its SVM features on gapped di-peptides (). Other tools such as gpo sp loc () and gn egp loc () make predictions for bacterial proteins by clustering Swiss-Prot proteins with annotated s cls based on their GO terms and amino acid properties using the k nearest neighbor algorithm. Some methods, such as sub cell predict and hens bc combine multiple classifying algorithms in order to boost the prediction performance (). locate p () and Augur () differentiate between different types of membrane anchored cell wall anchored and secreted proteins for gram positive bacterial proteomes. Based on the principle that training datasets could benefit from being genus specific, tbp red () was developed specifically for the genus of Mycobacterium spp. Even though many bacterial SCL prediction methods have been published, most of them focus on optimizing prediction accuracy maximizing the number of positive predictions on the training dataset, at the expense of producing more false positive results page 1609 16081615

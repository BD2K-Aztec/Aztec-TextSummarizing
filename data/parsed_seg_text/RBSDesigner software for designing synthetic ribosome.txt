Motivation: rbs designer predicts the translation efficiency of existing mRNA sequences and designs synthetic ribosome binding sites rbs s for a given coding sequence (CDS) to yield a desired level of protein expression. The program implements the mathematical model for translation initiation described in Na et al. (Mathematical modeling of translation initiation for the estimation of its efficiency to computationally design mRNA sequences with a desired expression level in prokaryotes. BMC Syst. Biol., 4, 71). The program additionally incorporates the effect on translation efficiency of the spacer length between a shine dalgarno (SD) sequence and an AUG codon, which is crucial for the incorporation of f met trna into the ribosome. rbs designer provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for the convenient design of synthetic rbs s. Availability: rbs designer is written in Python and Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 and is publicly available as precompiled stand-alone software on the web (http://rbs.

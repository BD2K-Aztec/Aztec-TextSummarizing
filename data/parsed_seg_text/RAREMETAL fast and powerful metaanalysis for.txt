rare metal is a computationally efficient tool for meta analysis of rare variants genotyped using sequencing or arrays. rare metal facilitates analyses of individual studies, accommodates a variety of input file formats, handles related and unrelated individuals , executes both single variant and burden tests and performs conditional association analyses.

introduction in genome wide association studies, meta analysis has been key in establishing association between common variants and complex traits (). Recent advances in exo me sequencing and the development of exo me genotyping arrays are enabling complex disease studies to explore association between rare variants of clear functional consequence and complex traits. For these rare variants, single variant tests can lack power, and association tests that group rare variants by gene or functional unit are favored (). Here, we describe a tool for meta analysis of rare variant association studies for quantitative traits. Our tool enables individual studies to account for study specific covariates as well as family and population structure. In addition, it generates summaries of linkage disequilibrium information that allow association tests for groups of rare variants during meta analysis

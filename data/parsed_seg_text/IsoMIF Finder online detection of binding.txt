isom if Finder is an online server for the identification of molecular interaction field m if similarities. User defined binding site m ifs can be compared to datasets of pre-calculated m ifs or against a user defined list of PDB entries. The interface can be used for the prediction of function, identification of potential cross reactivity or poly pharmacological targets and drug repurposing. Detected similarities can be viewed in a browser or within a PyMOL session. Availability and Implementation: isom if Finder uses js mol (no java plugin required), is cross browser and freely available at bcb me du sherbrooke ca imf i

We have developed an rnase q analysis workflow for single ended Illumina reads, termed r seq flow. This workflow includes a set of analytic functions, such as quality control for sequencing data, signal tracks of mapped reads, calculation of expression levels, identification of differentially expressed genes and coding SNPs calling. This workflow is formalized and managed by the Pegasus Workflow Management System, which maps the analysis modules onto available computational resources, automatically executes the steps in the appropriate order and supervises the whole running process. r seq flow is available as a Virtual Machine with all the necessary software, which eliminates any complex configuration and installation steps.

introduction with the recent technological breakthroughs in the study of the whole transcriptome (), rnase q datasets have been generated to decipher, characterize and quantify the set of all RNA molecules produced in cells. read alignment tools () and gene expression estimation tools () have been developed to analyze millions of reads generated from mRNA sequencing and to determine the expression level. However, the majority of these tools have focused on single functions, resulting in the frequent incompatibility of data interfaces among different tools. Therefore, integrating these tools into an overall computation, or, a workflow, is critical for downstream rnase q data analysis. Recent works on rnase q analysis pipelines include in gap (), r seq tools () and array express hts (). Each of them offers a subset of common rnase q analytical functions that are organized

One of the major issues in genome wide association studies is to solve the missing her-itability problem. While considering epistatic interactions among multiple SNPs may contribute to solving this problem, existing software can not detect statistically significant high order interactions. We propose software named lamp link which employs a cutting edge method to enumerate statistically significant SNP combinations from genome wide case control data. lamp link is implemented as a set of additional functions to PLINK, and hence existing procedures with PLINK can be applicable. Applied to the 1000 Genomes Project data, lamp link detected a combination of five SNPs that are statistically significantly accumulated in the Japanese population. Availability and Implementation: lamp link is available at http://a-terada.github.io/lamplink/.

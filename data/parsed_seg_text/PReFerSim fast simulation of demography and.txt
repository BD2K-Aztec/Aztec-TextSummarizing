The Poisson Random Field (PRF) model has become an important tool in population genetics to study weakly deleterious genetic variation under complicated demographic scenarios. Currently, there are no freely available software applications that allow simulation of genetic variation data under this model. Here we present prefers im an ANSI C program that performs forward simulations under the PRF model. prefers im models changes in population size, arbitrary amounts of inbreeding, dominance and distributions of selective effects. Users can track summaries of genetic variation over time and output trajectories of selected alleles.

introduction understanding the behavior of selected mutations in finite populations is important in population, medical and conservation genetics. Two main computational approaches have been used to model weakly deleterious mutations. First, under the Poisson Random Field (PRF) framework (), a Poisson number of independent mutations enter the population each generation, with subsequent changes in allele frequency due to selection and drift. The PRF framework is a mainstay in population genetic inference of demography and selection (). However, existing implementations of the PRF model do not provide the ages or selection coefficients of individual mutations or permit the user to follow allele frequency trajectories over time. Moreover, including biological complications, like inbreeding at certain time points, or dominance effects, are difficult for the average user within existing software (). The second approach involves simulation of entire populations forward in time. Here, individuals reproduce each generation in proportion to their fitness. Several software programs exist to perform such simulations, including sfs code (), SLiM () and fwd pp (). These programs are designed to simulate large regions of genetic variation with linkage and arbitrary recombination and they track chromosomal regions through time, rather than the behavior of individual mutations. Thus, unless the recombination rate is exceptionally large, they are not directly comparable to the PRF model which assumes free recombination. Further, these simulations may not be ideal for generating trajectories of selected alleles because the trajectories of V C The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Finally, some features, such as arbitrary amounts of inbreeding, are not included in sfs code and SLiM. The recently released GO Fish () also models individual mutations, but currently does not model distributions of fitness effects nor does it have a complete stand-alone software package. Here, we present a new program, prefers im which combines these approaches and performs forward simulations under the PRF model for a single population. Two features distinguish prefers im from existing implementations of the PRF model and forward simulation programs. First, prefers im can track allele frequencies over time, and the ages and trajectories of individual mutations. Second, prefers im can simulate large amounts of genetic variation data with free recombination quickly.

conclusion prefers im is a forward in time population genetic simulation program that can generate data under the PRF model considering complex demography and arbitrary models of selection and dominance. Given the growing interest in studying how demography affects deleterious variation across a wide range of tax a (), there is a need for population genetic software that can easily simulate large amounts of data under complex evolutionary models. As such, we anticipate that prefers im will play an important role in future studies..

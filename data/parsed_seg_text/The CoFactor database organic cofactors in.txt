Motivation: Organic enzyme cofactors are involved in many enzyme reactions. Therefore, the analysis of cofactors is crucial to gain a better understanding of enzyme catalysis. To aid this, we have created the CoFactor database. Results: CoFactor provides a web interface to access hand curated data extracted from the literature on organic enzyme cofactors in biocatalysis, as well as automatically collected information. CoFactor includes information on the conformational and solvent accessibility variation of the enzyme bound cofactors, as well as mechanistic and structural information about the hosting enzymes. Availability: The database is publicly available and can be accessed at

introduction enzymes are proteins that catalyze the repertoire of chemical reactions found in nature, and as such are vitally important molecules. They are generally composed of the 20 common amino acid residues, but many also require small molecules in addition for the catalysis to occur. In some cases, these molecules are involved in regulation or in ensuring the correct folding remote from the active site. However, many are termed cofactors, as they are required in the active site and are directly involved in catalysis. These cofactors may be either metal ions, whose involvement in catalysis we handle in metal macie (), or small organic molecules, which are described here. In both cases, these cofactors extend and enhance the basic catalytic toolkit of enzymes. To date, there has been little collation of information on organic cofactors and their functions outside of the primary literature. CoFactor has been designed to remedy this, as MACiE () and metal macie were designed to collate data on enzyme mechanisms and metal ions in catalysis, respectively.

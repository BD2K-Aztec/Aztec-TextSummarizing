Driven by dramatic technological improvements, large scale characterization of lymphocyte receptor repertoires via high throughput sequencing is now feasible. Although promising, the high germline and somatic diversity, especially of b cell immunoglobu-lin repertoires, presents challenges for analysis requiring the development of specialized computational pipelines. We developed the REpertoire Sequencing TOolkit (pRESTO) for processing reads from high throughput lymphocyte receptor studies. pRESTO processes raw sequences to produce error corrected sorted and annotated sequence sets, along with a wealth of metrics at each step. The toolkit supports multiplexed primer pools, single or paired end reads and emerging technologies that use single molecule identifiers. pRESTO has been tested on data generated from Roche and Illumina platforms. It has a built in capacity to parallelize the work between available processors and is able to efficiently process millions of sequences generated by typical high throughput projects. Availability and implementation: pRESTO is freely available for academic use. The software package and detailed tutorials may be down-loaded from http://clip.

introduction high throughput sequencing technologies now enable large scale characterization of lymphocyte receptor repertoires rep seq (). rep seq studies have used a variety of next generation sequencing platforms, including Roche's 454 and illumina s Genome Analyzer. Researchers are now beginning to take advantage of newer platforms, such as the mi seq offered by Illumina, which can generate 410 million paired end automatic file segregation into their workflow for distributed processing on cluster computing resources. A detailed description of each pRESTO tool is provided in the Supplementary Material (summarized in Supplementary Table S1). Example datasets with step by step tutorials covering the workflows illustrated in can be found on the pRESTO website.

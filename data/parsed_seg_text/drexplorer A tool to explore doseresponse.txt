Motivation: Nonlinear dose response models are primary tools for estimating the potency [e.g. half maximum inhibitory concentration (IC) known as IC50] of anti-cancer drugs. We present dr explorer software, which enables biologists to evaluate replicate reproducibility, detect outlier data points, fit different models, select the best model, estimate IC values at different percentiles and assess drug drug interactions. dr explorer serves as a computation engine within the R environment and a graphical interface for users who do not have programming backgrounds. Availability and implementation: The dr explorer R package is freely available from git hub at https://github.com/nickytong/drexplorer. A graphical user interface is shipped with the package.

introduction understanding the dose response relationship of therapeutic compounds is a major focus of clinical oncology. large scale drug screening in cancer cell lines has demonstrated that different genomic characteristics (mutations) confer distinct drug sensitivity, supporting patient stratification into treatment regimens on the basis of genomic markers (). Cell lines resistant to single drug treatment may respond to synergistic drug combinations (). As cell viability assays become widely used, it is important to provide easily accessible tools to analyze drug profiling data. We developed dr explorer software in the R environment (R Core) to encompass several aspects of dose response analysis: assess reproducibility of replicated experiments, detect outlier data points, fit different models, identify the best model, estimate inhibitory concentration (IC) values and evaluate drug drug interactions.

conclusion dr explorer is a versatile R package encompassing several aspects of dose response and drug drug interaction analysis. The GUI enables biologists without programming skills to analyze their data.

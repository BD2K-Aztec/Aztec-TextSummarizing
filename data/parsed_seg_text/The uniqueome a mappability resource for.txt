Quantification applications of short tag sequencing data (such as cnv seq and rnase q depend on knowing the uniqueness of specific genomic regions at a given threshold of error. Here, we present the unique ome a genomic resource for understanding the uniquely mappable proportion of genomic sequences. Pre-computed data are available for human, mouse, fly and worm genomes in both color space and nucle to tide space and we demonstrate the utility of this resource as applied to the quantification of rnase q data. Availability: Files, scripts and supplementary data are available from

Motivation: In order to discover quantitative trait loci, multi-dimensional genomic datasets combining dna seq and chip rnase q require methods that rapidly correlate tens of thousands of molecular phenotypes with millions of genetic variants while appropriately controlling for multiple testing. Results: We have developed fast qtl a method that implements a popular cis qtl mapping strategy in a user and cluster friendly tool. fast qtl also proposes an efficient permutation procedure to control for multiple testing. The outcome of permutations is modeled using beta distributions trained from a few permutations and from which adjusted p values can be estimated at any level of significance with little computational cost. The g eu vadis  g tex pilot datasets can be now easily analyzed an order of magnitude faster than previous approaches. Availability and implementation: Source code, binaries and comprehensive documentation of fast qtl are freely available to download at http://fastqtl.sourceforge.net/

introduction genome wide association studies have shown that most common trait associated variants fall into non-coding genomic regions and likely alter gene regulation (). This has motivated large scale studies to catalog candidate regulatory variants (quantitative trait loci; QTLs) associated with various molecular phenotypes (i.e. quantitative molecular traits with a genomic location) across various populations (), cell () and tissue types (). Mapping QTLs in this context usually consists of finding statistically significant associations between phenotype quantifications and nearby genetic variants; task commonly undertaken using linear regressions (). Alternative approaches have also been developed to increase discovery power by accounting for confounding factors (), integrating functional annotations (), leveraging allelic imbalance (van de) or aggregating measurements across multiple tissues (). In practice, this requires millions of association tests in order to scan all possible phenotype variant pairs in cis (i.e. variants located within a specific window around a phenotype), resulting in millions of nominal p values. Matrix e qtl () has recently emerged as a 'gold standard' for this task () by taking advantage of efficient matrix V C The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press.

conclusion we present fast qtl a QTL mapper in cis for molecular phenotypes that implements a new permutation scheme to accurately and rapidly correct for multiple testing at both the genotype and phenotype levels. fast qtl has several advantages compared with existing methods, making it the ideal candidate to map QTLs for the coming wave of large scale datasets regrouping many different layers of molecular phenotypes and near complete collection of variant sites. First, permutations are modeled with a beta distribution, parameterized from a relatively small number of permutations. This results in accurate adjusted p values which could not be feasibly obtained by standard or adaptive permutation analysis; for example down to 10 128 in the g eu vadis dataset. In practice, having well calibrated adjusted p values on the full range (0, 1) is of crucial importance to (1) estimate the number of tests made under the null (quantity underlying efficient FDR correction methods) and to (2) meta analyze multiple QTL studies together. Second, the beta approximation behaves well enough with only 100 permutations to rapidly assess the impact on the analysis of important parameters such as cis window size and covariates like the number of PEER factors (). And finally, fast qtl is fast ($16 faster than Matrix e qtl for the same number of permutations) due to an efficient implementation of linear regressions, optimized C  code, efficient permutation schemes and rapid data retrieval from indexed files, while remaining user and cluster friendly. To summarize, fast qtl provides better adjusted p values than the best method so far, Matrix e qtl with a direct permutation scheme, while being significantly faster. In addition, fast qtl also provides a modular base onto which new functionalities are being implemented, such as fine mapping of causal variants, conditional analysis to discover multiple independent QTLs per phenotype and interaction analysis to discover sex or disease specific QTLs.

HPG Aligner applies suffix arrays for DNA read mapping. This implementation produces a highly sensitive and extremely fast mapping of DNA reads that scales up almost linearly with read length. The approach presented here is faster (over 20Ã‚ for long reads) and more sensitive (over 98% in a wide range of read lengths) than the current state of the art mappers. HPG Aligner is not only an optimal alternative for current sequencers but also the only solution available to cope with longer reads and growing throughputs produced by forthcoming sequencing technologies.

introduction among the many applications of the high throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies, DNA resequencing is probably the most extensively used because of its important clinical implications (). The most time consuming step in HTS data processing is the mapping process, for which many tools are already available (). However, while accuracy of short reads mapping process is quite reasonable, speed still remains to be an issue. And, moreover, given the way in which available mappers implement current state of the art mapping algorithms, such as burroughs wheeler Transform, accuracy usually falls down as read length increases because of the accumulation of errors. Therefore, there is an obvious need of new approaches that overcome these current and future problems, given that the trend in HTS technologies is to increase read length and throughput (). Suffix array (SA) has recently started to be applied to accelerate DNA () or RNA () read mapping. Here, we propose an approach, based on SA (), that enormously increases the mapping speed without sacrificing accuracy for an ample range of read lengths.

Motivation: Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) is a popular tool for measuring molecular mobility and how mobility relates to molecular interaction dynamics and bioactivity in living cells. The FCS technique has been significantly advanced by its combination with super resolution STED microscopy ste dfcs. Specifically, the use of gated detection has shown great potential for enhancing ste dfcs but has also created a demand for software which is efficient and also implements the latest algorithms. Prior to this study, no open software has been available which would allow practical time gating and correlation of point data derived from ste dfcs experiments.

introduction fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) is a well established statistical technique for characterizing diffusion and kinetics of fluorescently labelled molecules in solution (). Through the advent of confocal microscopes, which allow detection to within small femto liter volumes, it was then possible to apply FCS techniques to study kinetics of a broad range of biological molecules at the surface or within the cytoplasm of biological cells. (). More recently, super resolution techniques have opened up a new vista in biological imaging, and one of these techniques known as STimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy () has been combined with FCS to study diffusion of molecules below the diffraction limit of light (). Truly capable of studying membranes at the nanoscale 200 nm, the application of ste dfcs to biological imaging has illuminated the kinetics of proteins and lipids whose mechanisms have until now remained elusive (). Until recently, the ste dfcs technique has only been applied to study a few select mechanisms due to the technically demanding and specialist nature of the ste dfcs acquisition V C The Author 2015.

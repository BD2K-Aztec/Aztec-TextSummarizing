We have implemented a high performance computing (HPC) version of prot test that can be executed in parallel in multicore desktops and clusters. This version, called prot test 3, includes new features and extended capabilities. Availability: prot test 3 source code and binaries are freely available under GNU license for download from http://darwin.uvigo.es/ software prottest3 linked to a Mercurial repository at bit bucket (https://bitbucket.org/).

introduction recent advances in modern sequencing technologies have resulted in an increasing capability for gathering large datasets. Long sequence alignments with hundred or thousands of sequences are not rare these days, but their analysis imply access to large computing infrastructures and or the use of simpler and faster methods. In this regard, high performance computing (HPC) becomes essential for the feasibility of more sophisticated and often more accurate analyses. Indeed, during the last years HPC facilities have become part of the general services provided by many universities and research centers. Besides, multicore desktops are now standard. The program prot test () is one of the most popular tools for selecting models of amino acid replacement, a rout inary step in phylogenetic analysis. prot test is written in Java and uses the program phy ml () for the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of model parameters and phylogenetic trees and the PAL library () to handle alignments and trees. Statistical model selection can be a very intensive task when the alignments are large and include divergent sequences, highlighting the need for new bion for matic tools capable of exploiting the available computational resources. Here we describe a new version of prot test prot test 3, that has been completely redesigned to take advantage of HPC environments and desktop multicore processors, significantly reducing the execution time for model selection in large protein alignments.

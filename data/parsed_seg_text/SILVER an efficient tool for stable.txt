With the advance of experimental technologies, different stable isotope labeling methods have been widely applied to quantitative proteomics. Here, we present an efficient tool named SILVER for processing the stable isotope labeling mass spectrometry data. SILVER implements novel methods for quality control of quantification at spectrum, peptide and protein levels, respectively. Several new quantification confidence filters and indices are used to improve the accuracy of quantification results. The performance of SILVER was verified and compared with max quant and Proteome Discoverer using a large scale dataset and two standard datasets. The results suggest that SILVER shows high accuracy and robustness while consuming much less processing time. Additionally, SILVER provides user friendly interfaces for parameter setting, result visualization, manual validation and some useful statistics analyses.

introduction mass spectrometry (MS) has been applied in proteomics research for 420 years. The great advantages in resolution, sensitivity and accuracy make MS the dominating technology in proteomics (). As the technology improves, ms based quantitative proteomics has become an important research field in proteomics. Among the strategies developed for quantitative proteomics, stable isotope labeling strategies have been widely used thanks to their high accuracy and precision. Recently, several software tools have been developed for stable isotope labeling quantification, such as ms quant () and Census (), the well known software package max quant () embedded with its own search engine, named Andromeda (), as well as a newly published quantification pipeline iso quant (), which was designed especially for stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture sila c (). However, there has been little attention to quantitative quality control among these tools and there is hardly any proper algorithm focused on this issue (). On the other hand, the rapidly growing amount of large scale quantitative proteomics data requires faster and more efficient tools. Here, we present a new efficient tool, named SILVER for stable isotope labeling data analysis with special considerations for quality control of quantification. SILVER introduces novel quantification confidence filters and indices, which finally result in accurate and robust quantification for stable isotope labeling experiments. Meanwhile, SILVER is fast and flexible by supporting different types of MS data such as the original raw files and the mz xml format files. SILVER takes the quality control results of peptide prophet () or pep distiller () as the input and provides user friendly interfaces for parameter setting, result visualization, manual validation and some useful statistical analyses.

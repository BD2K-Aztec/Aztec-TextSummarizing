The volume of an internal protein pocket is fundamental to ligand accessibility. Few programs that compute such volumes manage dynamic data from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Limited performance often prohibits analysis of large datasets. We present epoc k an efficient command line tool that calculates pocket volumes from MD trajectories. A plugin for the VMD program provides a graphical user interface to facilitate input creation, run epoc k and analyse the results. Availability and implementation: epoc k Cþþ source code, Python analysis scripts, VMD Tcl plugin, documentation and installation instructions are freely available at http://epock.

introduction in drug design, the characterization of binding pockets is a key issue often addressed using molecular dynamics (MD). MD simulations unveil the evolution of large and complex biomolecular systems over time. With increasing computer power, MD generates increasingly large datasets with more frames and particles. The majority of existing programs are not optimized for such large trajectories, so analysis of pocket evolution requires improved software tools that are able to process pocket data in a reasonable time. To tackle this issue, we developed epoc k a software for efficient tracking of protein pocket volume throughout MD trajectories. We demonstrate epoc ks functionality on the ligand gated Gloeobacter violaceus Ion Channel gli c homologue of the human nicotinic receptor () and Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90).

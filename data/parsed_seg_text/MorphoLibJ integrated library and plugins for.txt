Motivation: Mathematical morphology (MM) provides many powerful operators for processing 2D and 3D images. However, most MM plugins currently implemented for the popular image j fiji platform are limited to the processing of 2D images. Results: The morphol ibj library proposes a large collection of generic tools based on MM to process binary and grey level 2D and 3D images, integrated into user friendly plugins. We illustrate how morphol ibj can facilitate the exploitation of 3D images of plant tissues. Availability and Implementation: morphol ibj is freely available at http://imagej.net/MorphoLibJ

introduction the continuous development of microscopy imaging techniques results in increasingly better spatial resolution, signal quality and throughput and allows 3D imaging of biological cells, tissues or organisms. Biological images present specific difficulties for automated analysis, due to data dimensionality (space, time, channels, etc.), acquisition artefacts, or low contrast. There is thus a recurrent need for efficient image processing algorithms and for user friendly software that integrates them to meet the needs for generic implementations and image j interfaces of MM operators, we developed the gpl licensed morphol ibj library. morphol ibj implements a large collection of MM algorithms applicable to 2D and 3D grey level images and integrated into user friendly interfaces.

conclusion the morphol ibj library provides a set of generic tools for image processing and analysis of biological samples. We demonstrated its applicability on 3D images of plant tissue. The cell resolved data provided by morphol ibj will be useful for the analysis of cell lineage, and the modelling of plant growth and morphogenesis in 3D.

Motivation: Repositories support the reuse of models and ensure transparency about results in publications linked to those models. With thousands of models available in repositories, such as the bio models database or the physio me Model Repository, a framework to track the differences between models and their versions is essential to compare and combine models. Difference detection not only allows users to study the history of models but also helps in the detection of errors and inconsistencies. Existing repositories lack algorithms to track a models development over time. Results: Focusing on SBML and CellML, we present an algorithm to accurately detect and describe differences between coexisting versions of a model with respect to (i) the models encoding, (ii) the structure of biological networks and (iii) mathematical expressions. This algorithm is implemented in a comprehensive and open source library called b ives. b ives helps to identify and characterize changes in computational models and thereby contributes to the documentation of a models history. Our work facilitates the reuse and extension of existing models and supports collaborative modelling. Finally, it contributes to better reproducibility of modelling results and to the challenge of model provenance. Availability and implementation: The workflow described in this article is implemented in b ives. b ives is freely available as source code and binary from sem sun i rostock de. The web interface bud hat demonstrates the capabilities of b ives at

introduction modelling and simulation is a standard approach to investigate complex biological processes. A steadily increasing number of computational models are available from open repositories such as the bio models database () or the physio me Model Repository (PMR2;). These repositories provide the infrastructure necessary to maintain model code and associated metadata. The distribution of models through these repositories accelerates collaborative research and encourages model reuse the reusability of models improves the modelling workflow, by reducing errors and saving time. Tracking the evolution of a model, that is providing information about changes in the model and its encoding, plays an important role in supporting the user (). The need of model version control has been emphasized repeatedly on several occasions ().

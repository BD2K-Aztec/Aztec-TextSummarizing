We present clic o Free Service, an online web service based on circo s which provides a user friendly interactive web based interface with configurable features to generate circo s circular plots. Availability and implementation: Online web service is freely available at

introduction circo s () is a Perl language based tool to represent visual data in a circular form. The native circo s software is provided through a command line interface (CLI). Installation and configuration of the software, though not difficult for users with command line experience, pose a certain degree of difficulty to those who are not familiar with the CLI. There are other alternatives to circo s that enable plotting of circular images, which including circo let to CIRCUS and r circo s (). circo let to and CIRCUS have been developed for more specialised functions. The former integrates Basic Local Alignment Search Tool or BLAST () results and the circo s plot via a web based user interface (UI), whereas the latter specializes in plotting structure variants of genomes. They are not flexible in generating plots with different data types. On the other hand, r circo s supports circo s data track plotting, but it is based on the r package CLI. Some of the applications above require setup, configuration and coding skills in order to fully utilize the applications. Users with little or no experience in the CLI environment could encounter a demanding learning curve. To address the issue, clic o FS (Open Circular Layout Interactive Converter) is developed. clic o FS is a user friendly web service which allows users to generate circo s plots easily. Not all functions of circo s can be done by clic o FS, such as chromosome axis breaks.

Motivation: Mass spectrometry (MS) instruments and experimental protocols are rapidly advancing, but de novo peptide sequencing algorithms to analyze tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra are lagging behind. Although existing de novo sequencing tools perform well on certain types of spectra [e.g. Collision Induced Dissociation (CID) spectra of tryptic peptides], their performance often deteriorates on other types of spectra, such as Electron Transfer Dissociation (ETD), higher energy Collisional Dissociation (HCD) spectra or spectra of non tryptic digests. Thus, rather than developing a new algorithm for each type of spectra, we develop a universal de novo sequencing algorithm called uni novo that works well for all types of spectra or even for spectral pairs (e.g. cide td spectral pairs). uni novo uses an improved scoring function that captures the dependences between different ion types, where such dependencies are learned automatically using a modified offset frequency function. Results: The performance of uni novo is compared with pep novo PEAKS and p novo using various types of spectra. The results show that the performance of uni novo is superior to other tools for ETD spectra and superior or comparable with others for CID and HCD spectra. uni novo also estimates the probability that each reported reconstruction is correct, using simple statistics that are readily obtained from a small training dataset. We demonstrate that the estimation is accurate for all tested types of spectra (including CID, HCD, ETD, cide td and hcd etd spectra of trypsin, lys c or AspN digested peptides). Availability: uni novo is implemented in JAVA and tested on Windows, Ubuntu and OS X machines. uni novo is available at http://proteomics. ucsd edu software uni novo html along with the manual.

introduction de novo peptide sequencing by tandem mass (MS/MS) spectrometry is a valuable alternative to MS/MS database search. In contrast to the database search approach that utilizes the information from proteome, the de novo sequencing approach attempts to identify peptides only using the information from the input spectrum. Hence, most de novo sequencing algorithms are based on the prior knowledge of the fragmentation characteristics (e.g. ion types and their propensities) of MS/MS spectra (). The fragmentation characteristics are highly dependent on the fragmentation method used to generate the spectrum. Among several fragmentation methods available, the collision induced dissociation (CID) is the most commonly used method. Accordingly, the fragmentation characteristics of CID have been well studied compared with recently introduced fragmentation methods, such as electron transfer dissociation (ETD) and higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD) (). As a result, many de novo sequencing algorithms have been introduced for CID spectra; for example, PEAKS () and pep novo () are the state of the art de novo sequencing tools for CID spectra. Other fragmentation methods like ETD and HCD have a great potential for de novo sequencing. For example, for highly charged spectra, ETD provides better fragmentation and thus is better suited for de novo sequencing than CID (). Also, more complete fragmentation of peptide ions (especially in low mass regions) in HCD provides a better chance to obtain more accurate de novo reconstructions than CID (). Furthermore, modern mass spectrometers (e.g. lt q orbit rap ve los allow the generation of paired spectra (e.g. cide td or hcd etd spectral pairs). Since CID (or HCD) and ETD spectra provide complementary information for peptide sequencing (), such spectral pairs (or even triplets) enable more accurate de novo sequencing. Several de novo sequencing algorithms were recently presented to take advantage of those new fragmentation methods. For instance proposed a de novo sequencing algorithm for ETD spectra, which is used by PEAKS. For HCD spectra introduced a de novo sequencing tool, p novo that not only takes advantage of the high precision peaks in HCD spectra but also uses the information of abundant immo nium and internal ions. In case of spectral pairs proposed a greedy algorithm (for cide cd spectral pairs) that significantly boosts the performance of de novo sequencing. Datta and presented Spectrum Fusion, a de novo sequencing algorithm for cide td spectral pairs. Spectrum Fusion constructs a combined spectrum from the input cide td spectral pair using a Bayesian Network. It generates multiple de novo sequences using the combined spectrum and score them by the scoring function in by onic ().This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/), which permits non-commercial re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. For commercial re-use, please contact journals permission soup com algorithm, ADEPTS, for cide td spectral pairs. Given a CID/ ETD spectral pair, ADEPTS first finds 1000 candidate de novo sequences from each spectrum, using PEAKS. The total 2000 candidate sequences are then re scored against the input spectral pair, and the best scoring peptide is reported. While the above tools perform well for the spectra generated from the fragmentation method(s) that each tool targeted, they often generate inferior results for the spectra from other fragmentation methods. Moreover, if alternative proteases (e.g. lys c or AspN) are used for protein digestion, these tools may produce suboptimal results because different proteases often generate peptides with different fragmentation characteristics (). In case of the database search approach recently introduced a universal algorithm msg fdb that shows a significantly better peptide identification performance than other existing database search tools such as Mascot  Percolator (). However, a universal de novo sequencing tool is still missing. We present uni novo a universal de novo sequencing tool that can be generalized for various types (i.e. the combinations of the fragmentation method and the protease used to digest sample proteins) of spectra. The scoring function of uni novo is easily trainable using a training dataset consisting of thousands of annotated spectra. All information needed for de novo sequencing are learned from the training dataset, and the running time for training is 55 h in a typical desktop environment. Currently, uni novo is trained for CID, HCD and ETD spectra of trypsin, lys c or AspN digested peptides. We show that the performance of uni novo is better than or comparable with pep novo PEAKS and p novo for various types of spectra. One of the biggest challenges in de novo sequencing is to estimate the error rate of the resulting de novo reconstructions. Unlike MS/MS database search tools that commonly uses the target decoy approach () to estimate the statistical significance of the peptide identifications, de novo reconstructions have rarely been subjected to a statistical significance analysis in the past. Several de novo sequencing tools report the error rate of amino acid predictions (e.g. confidence scores in PEAKS), but this is often not sufficient because the overall quality of the sequence can not be easily determined by the error rates of individual amino acid predictions. To our knowledge, only pep novo reports the empirical probability that the output peptide is correct. pep novo predicts the probabilities using logistic regression with multiple features of the reconstructions such as length and score, which are extracted from a training dataset consisting of hundreds of thousands of annotated spectra (). However, pep novo does not include an automated training procedure (that would allow to easily extend pep novo for newly emerging mass spectrometry approaches) and is currently trained only for CID [Extending pep novo beyond CID spectra requires training complex boosting based re ranking models for predicting peak ranks and re scoring peptide candidates. pep novo training includes several manual steps and the availability of a very large corpus of training spectra (. Thus, in case of non cid fragmentation methods, it remains unclear how to obtain accurate error rate estimation for de novo reconstructions. uni novo estimates the probability that each reported reconstruction is correct, using simple statistics that are readily obtained from a small training dataset. We demonstrate that the estimation is accurate for all tested types of spectra (including CID, HCD, ETD, cide td and hcd etd spectra of trypsin, lys c or AspN digested peptides). This allows uni novo to automatically filter out low quality spectra.

conclusion we presented a universal de novo sequencing tool uni novo that works well for various types of spectra. uni novo can be easily trained for different types of spectra using only thousands of PSMs that typically can be obtained from a single MS/MS run. The experimental results show that uni novo generates accurate and long de novo reconstructions from spectra of CID, ETD, HCD and cide td fragmentation methods and spectra of trypsin, lys c or AspN digested peptides. We also showed that uni novo is better than or comparable with other state of the art tools. As pointed out by Ma and Johnson (2011), de novo sequences not only are valuable for the analysis of the novel peptides that are not present in proteome databases but also can facilitate the homology based database searches. Since the reconstructions reported by uni novo contain mass gaps representing the total mass of multiple amino acids [termed gapped peptides (, msb pm algorithm () can be used for fast exact or homology searches uni novo msb pm. msb pm enables searches against a sequence database using gapped peptides as queries. Currently msb pm takes gapped peptides generated by ms gapped dictionary () ms gapped dictionary msb pm. However, the reconstructions from uni novo are usually longer than those from ms gapped dictionary (89 versus 56). Since the search time of msb pm strongly depends on the length of gapped peptides the longer gapped peptides, the shorter search time the running time of uni novo msb pm is smaller than ms gapped dictionary msb pm by an order of magnitude in a blind search against the IPI Human proteome database ver.3.87 () (data not shown).. De novo sequencing with qualify filtering of spectra. Given a spectrum, if the parameter set accuracy threshold is set, uni novo attempts to achieve set accuracy (an estimated probability of the spectrum being correctly sequenced) exceeding set accuracy threshold. If it fails to generate such a set, the spectrum is filtered out. An unfiltered spectrum is called a qualified spectrum. We set set accuracy threshold  0:8. (a) the number of qualified spectrum, (b) the percentage of qualified spectra that were correctly sequenced, (c) the average length of correct reconstructions

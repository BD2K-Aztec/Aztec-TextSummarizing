Speed is of the essence in combating Ebola; thus, computational approaches should form a significant component of Ebola research. As for the development of any modern drug, computational biology is uniquely positioned to contribute through comparative analysis of the genome sequences of Ebola strains and three dimensional protein modeling. Other computational approaches to Ebola may include large scale docking studies of Ebola proteins with human proteins and with small molecule libraries, computational modeling of the spread of the virus, computational mining of the Ebola literature and creation of a curated Ebola database. Taken together, such computational efforts could significantly accelerate traditional scientific approaches. In recognition of the need for important and immediate solutions from the field of computational biology against Ebola, the International Society for Computational Biology is cb announces a prize for an important computational advance in fighting the Ebola virus. is cb will confer the is cb Fight against Ebola Award, along with a prize The International Society for Computational Biology is cb is dedicated to advancing the understanding of living systems through computation. is cb now represents more than 3200 computational biologists working in over 70 countries. It organizes more than seven annual international meetings and confers several major prizes, including the is cb Accomplishment by a Senior Scientist Award, the is cb Overton Prize and the is cb Outstanding Contributions Award. With the is cb Fight against Ebola Award, the society offers for the first time an award for a specific scientific objective, thereby acknowledging the urgency of action required to fight a rising challenge.

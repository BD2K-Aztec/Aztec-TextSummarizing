Motivation: In order to construct gene regulatory networks of higher organisms from gene expression and promoter sequence data efficiently, we developed fast medusa. In this parallelized version of the regulatory network modeling tool MEDUSA, expression and sequence data are shared among a user defined number of processors on a single multi-core machine or cluster. Our results show that fast medusa allows a more efficient utilization of computational resources. While the determination of a regulatory network of brain tumor in Homo sapiens takes 12 days with MEDUSA, fast medusa obtained the same results in 6 h by utilizing 100 processors.

introduction among the numerous ways to determine gene regulatory networks of higher organism (), MEDUSA is a well known and powerful computational tool (). Utilizing a boosting algorithm (), MEDUSA models promoter sequences and gene expression data from various experimental conditions. Providing a global predictive model of condition specific expression states of target genes, MEDUSA has been successfully used to discover novel regulators in oxygen and he me regulatory networks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (). Although MEDUSA is a powerful computational tool for inferring gene regulatory networks, it has certain limitations. MEDUSA requires the commercially available software package, MATLAB. In addition, the execution time of MEDUSA increases dramatically with larger sizes of input data sets. For example, MEDUSA needed 4 weeks for the modeling and analysis of about 7000 genes using 1000 iterations. Parallel computing has been used to solve the latter problem for several bioinformatics applications to date (). Here we introduce fast medusa a fast, parallelized, open source implementation of MEDUSA in C++ that uses freely available libraries. Our benchmark results showed that

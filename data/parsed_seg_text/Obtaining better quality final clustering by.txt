Motivation: Clustering methods including k means SOM, UPGMA, da a CLICK, gene cluster CAST, DHC, pm et is and k metis have been widely used in biological studies for gene expression, protein localization, sequence recognition and more. All these clustering methods have some benefits and drawbacks. We propose a novel graph based clustering software called com usa for combining the benefits of a collection of clusterings into a final clustering having better overall quality. Results: com usa implementation is compared with pm et is k metis and k means. Experimental results on artificial, real and biological datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. com usa produces very good quality clusters in a short amount of time.

introduction clustering is the process of organizing objects into groups which have similar members; a distance metric is used for evaluating the similarity. Clustering is also known as unsupervised classification in the literature. Clustering has a long and rich history in a variety of scientific fields (). Taxonomists, social scientists, psychologists, biologists, statisticians, mathematicians, engineers, computer scientists, medical researchers and others who collect and process real data have all contributed to clustering methodology. There are many well known clustering algorithms, as stated earlier. Each clustering method provides some benefits. Therefore, multiple clusterings can be obtained for the same dataset, and these benefits can be combined into a final clustering. com usa takes a collection of clusterings as input, and it creates a final clustering with better overall quality. In other words, com usa combines the benefits of multiple clusterings into a final clustering. com usa is a general purpose software; it can be used on biological and non-biological datasets. However, in this article, we will evaluate com us as performance on biological datasets. * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

We present a novel R package named syn breed to derive genome based predictions from high throughput genotyping and large scale phenotyping data. The package contains a comprehensive collection of functions required to fit and cross validate genomic prediction models. All functions are embedded within the framework of a single, unified data object. Thereby a versatile genomic prediction analysis pipeline covering data processing, visualization and analysis is established within one software package. The implementation is flexible with respect to a wide range of data formats and models. The package fills an existing gap in the availability of user friendly software for next generation genetics research and education. Availability: syn breed is open source and available through CRAN http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/synbreed. The latest development version is available from r forge. The package syn breed is released with a vignette, a manual and three large scale example datasets (from package syn breed data
conclusion in the plant breeding community, there is a strong demand for a standard software covering a wide range of analysis steps. The package syn breed offers a comprehensive collection of methods required in the analysis of genomic prediction data. This is a step towards automatized analysis pipelines in the analysis of next generation genotype and phenotype data which are required to bring genomic prediction from theory to practice. Moreover, syn breed is a valuable tool for the education of young scientists and breeders.

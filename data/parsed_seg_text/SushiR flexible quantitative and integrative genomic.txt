Motivation: Interpretation and communication of genomic data require flexible and quantitative tools to analyze and visualize diverse data types, and yet, a comprehensive tool to display all common gen-omic data types in publication quality figures does not exist to date. To address this shortcoming, we present sushi r an r bioconductor package that allows flexible integration of genomic visualizations into highly customizable, publication ready multi panel figures from common genomic data formats including Browser Extensible Data (BED), bed graph and Browser Extensible Data paired end bed pe. sushi r is open source and made publicly available through git hub
introduction genomic science is a rich data intensive field in which diverse data types are combined to uncover and explore characteristics of sequence elements on a large scale. However, despite a growing set of mature standard visualization techniques and file formats, no comprehensive tools exist to facilitate multi panel visualization across a broad range of standard genomic data types. To address this deficiency, we developed sushi r a flexible R library that leverages standard visualization techniques and file formats to produce highly customizable publication quality figures of genomic data within the widespread analysis environment, R(R Core).

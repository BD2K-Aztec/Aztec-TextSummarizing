Accurate and complete mapping of short read sequencing to a reference genome greatly enhances the discovery of biological results and improves statistical predictions. We recently presented rna mate a pipeline for the recursive mapping of rnase q datasets. With the rapid increase in genome re-sequencing projects, progression of available mapping software and the evolution of file formats, we now present x mate an updated version of rna mate capable of mapping both rnase q and DNA datasets and with improved performance, output file formats, configuration files, and flexibility in core mapping software.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNase I hypersensi-tivity assays with high throughput sequencing have greatly accelerated the understanding of transcriptional and epigenetic regulation, although data reuse for the community of experimental biologists has been challenging. We created a data portal cist rome finder that can help query, evaluate and visualize publicly available Chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNase I hypersensitivity assays with high throughput sequencing data in human and mouse. The database currently contains 6378 samples over 4391 datasets, 313 factors and 102 cell lines or cell populations. Each dataset has gone through a consistent analysis and quality control pipeline; therefore, users could evaluate the overall quality of each dataset before examining binding sites near their genes of interest. cist rome finder is integrated with UCSC genome browser for visualization, primer 3plus for chip qpcr primer design and cist rome map for submitting newly available datasets. It also allows users to leave comments to facilitate data evaluation and update. Availability: http://cistrome.org/finder. Contact:

introduction genome wide mapping of transcription factor and chromatin regulator binding, histone modifications and chromatin accessibility is essential for elucidating the regulatory network of various biological processes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNase I hypersensitivity assays with high throughput sequencing chips eq and dnase seq have become essential techniques for studying transcriptional and epigenetic gene regulation. Most chips eq and dnase seq studies have raw data available from public repositories, such as NCBI Sequence Read Archive. However, the raw sequencing data are usually in the order of gigabyte size per sample, and data analysis is not only time consuming but also technically inhibitive for most experimental biologists. Even if investigators only want to check a few specific binding sites near their genes of interest, they need the computational resources and expertise to download the raw data, conduct data analysis such as read alignment, peak calling, nearby gene assignment and many others. In addition, these public datasets are often of variable quality, and bioinformatics novices do not often have the expertise to evaluate and compare different datasets. Although projects like ENCODE (ENCODE Project) and epi genome Roadmap () provide processed data online, they only cover data from these projects. We developed a web portal called cist rome finder which contains the most comprehensive collection to date of public chips eq and dnase seq data in human and mouse that have gone through a uniform data analysis and quality control pipeline. It enables investigators to query, evaluate, visualize and compare public chips eq and dnase seq data and select specific binding sites near genes of interest for functional studies.

conclusion cist rome finder provides a comprehensive catalogue and uniform processing of published chips eq and dnase seq datasets. The web interface provides flexibility to search and visualize the binding of specified factors in various conditions near genes of interest. Investigators can use cist rome finder to check whether a gene could be the potential target of a transcription or chromatin factor in a specific conditions and design chip qpcr primers to validate the binding in other conditions. We also give the users options to leave comments to help us evaluate datasets and submit new data through cist rome map to help keep the database up-to-date. We will continue to maintain and improve cist rome finder as more chip dnase seq data become available to facilitate the community in their transcriptional and epigenetic gene regulation studies. We keep the raw data and the pipeline script in case we need to rerun all the data with newest algorithms; we also use a version system for the pipeline to reproduce legacy results. In the future, we plan to combine cist rome analysis pipeline () with our chip dnase seq data collection; therefore, users could conduct integrative analysis of their own data and public data.

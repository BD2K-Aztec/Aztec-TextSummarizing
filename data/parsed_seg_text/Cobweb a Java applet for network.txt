Cobweb is a Java applet for real time network visualization; its strength lies in enabling the interactive exploration of networks. Therefore, it allows new nodes to be interactively added to a network by querying a database on a server. The network constantly rearranges to provide the most meaningful topological view. Availability: Cobweb is available under the GPLv3 and may be freely downloaded at

introduction network based techniques are used today to tackle a wide variety of scientific questions, ranging from interaction mechanisms in protein networks to signalling pathway analysis (). Consequently, there is a strong need to have tools to visualize and explore networks such as Cytoscape (), ge phi () and pro viz (). However, these programs aim at visualizing large networks and offer many features. They can not be integrated into web sites and have a significant learning curve. Therefore, we have developed Cobweb as a Java applet that has fewer features but can be easily used from any web page. Cobweb offers uncomplicated real time visualization of networks up to a few hundred nodes. In contrast to earlier web based approaches such as Medusa () and j squid (), Cobweb stresses interactive features. Thus, it is possible to interactively add new nodes to the network at which time the network topology changes to provide the most uncluttered view.

reg adb is a free and open source data management and analysis environment for infectious diseases. reg adb allows clinicians to store, manage and analyse patient data, including viral genetic sequences. Moreover, reg adb provides researchers with a mechanism to collect data in a uniform format and offers them a canvas to make newly developed bioinformatics tools available to clinicians and virolo-gists through a user friendly interface. Availability and implementation: Source code, binaries and documentation are available on http://rega.kuleuven.be/cev/regadb. reg adb is written in the Java programming language, using a web service oriented architecture.

introduction advances in infectious diseases research require efficient collaboration and exchange of clinical and virological data researchers need access to large amounts of data to test hypotheses or extract valuable information through data mining (). For this purpose, reg adb was developed as a free and open source data management and analysis environment for infectious diseases (). reg adb runs on Windows, Linux or Mac OS X. The system can be installed within a hospital or institute so that the data stays within the clinical environment. reg adb follows the idea of an integrated environment for bioinformatics analysis, such as the Genetic Data Environment (), virol ab () and gene ious (). The difference is that reg adb uses a relational database, and can be locally or remotely accessed. This allows reg adb to be used for clinical management and or research in one locality or for long term data sharing collaborations between different institutes.

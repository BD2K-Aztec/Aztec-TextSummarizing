Motivation: The experimental difficulties of alpha helical transmembrane protein structure determination make this class of protein an important target for sequence based structure prediction tools. The mem pack prediction server allows users to submit a transmembrane protein sequence and returns transmembrane topology, lipid exposure, residue contacts, helix helix interactions and helical packing arrangement predictions in both plain text and graphical formats using a number of novel machine learning based algorithms. Availability: The server can be accessed as a new component of the psi pred portal by at

introduction given the biological and pharmacological importance of transmembrane (TM) proteins and the difficulties associated with obtaining their crystal structures, the use of bioinformatics approaches to direct experimental work while furthering our understanding of their structure and function is essential. The mem pack prediction server applies a selection of machine learning based tools to predict TM topology the total number of TM helices, their boundaries and in out orientation relative to the membrane with the addition of lipid exposure, residue contacts, helix helix interactions, culminating in prediction of the optimal helical packing arrangement using a force directed algorithm provides an example of some of the server output. The underlying tools have recently been shown to provide significant improvements in prediction accuracy compared with existing methods. It is hoped that this service will be of benefit to the broader scientific community.

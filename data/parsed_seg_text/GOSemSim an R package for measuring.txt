The semantic comparisons of Gene Ontology (GO) annotations provide quantitative ways to compute similarities between genes and gene groups, and have became important basis for many bioinformatics analysis approaches. go sem sim is an R package for semantic similarity computation among GO terms, sets of GO terms, gene products and gene clusters. Four information content ic and a graph based methods are implemented in the go sem sim package, multiple species including human, rat, mouse, fly and yeast are also supported. The functions provided by the go sem sim offer flexibility for applications, and can be easily integrated into high throughput analysis pipelines. Availability: go sem sim is released under the GNU General Public License within Bioconductor project, and freely available at

introduction the Gene Ontology (GO) is becoming the de facto standard for the annotation of gene products. The GO consortium annotates gene products with terms from three orthogonal ontologies organized as directed acyclic graphs, laying the foundation for quantitative semantic comparisons. Several metrics have been proposed to measure the semantic similarity between GO annotations, and have been verified in terms of the correlations with sequence similarity () protein protein interactions (), and gene expression profiles (). The GO semantic similarity provides the basis for functional comparison of gene products, and therefore has been widely used in bioinformatics applications, such as protein sub-nuclear localization prediction (), gene function prediction () and cluster analysis of genes (). Two typical approaches to measure semantic similarity of GO terms are information content ic and graph based measures. * To whom correspondence should be addressed.  The authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the first two authors should be regarded as joint First authors the ic based measures depend on the frequencies of two GO terms involved and that of their closest common ancestor term in a specific corpus of GO annotations, such as the UniProt Knowledgebase. Three ic based measures, resnik s (), Lin's () and Jiang and conrath s () have been introduced from natural language taxonomies by to compare gene products in early time. On the basis of resnik s and Lin's definition, an ic based measure has also been presented by. Considering that the specificity of a GO term is usually determined by its location in the GO graph proposed a graph based strategy to compute semantic similarity using the topology of the GO graph structure. In the wang s method, the semantics of GO terms are encoded into a numeric format and the different semantic contributions of the distinct relations are considered. Several online tools for semantic similarity measurement of gene products are available at present, such as g sesame () and fuss i meg (http://xldb.fc.ul.pt/rebil/ssm/). To facilitate large scale analysis, two freely available software packages, go graph () and go sim () implementing classic ic based methods for semantic comparison of GO terms have also been developed. Here, we present an R package named go sem sim to compute semantic similarity among GO terms, sets of GO terms, gene products and gene clusters, providing both ic and graph based methods.

The info biotics Workbench is an integrated software suite incorporating model specification, simulation, parameter optimization and model checking for Systems and Synthetic Biology. A modular model specification allows for straightforward creation of large scale models containing many compartments and reactions. Models are simulated either using stochastic simulation or numerical integration, and visualized in time and space. Model parameters and structure can be optimized with evolutionary algorithms, and model properties calculated using probabilistic model checking. Availability: Source code and binaries for Linux, Mac and Windows

introduction a comprehensive and generic framework for modelling biological systems from the molecular to organismal scales remains a distant prospect. As a step towards this, we have developed a modelling framework and supporting simulation and analysis software that is general enough to model a diverse range of systems, and tailored towards large, multi compartment cellular systems. We have used our software to successfully model and address a number of problems in Systems and Synthetic Biology, including abscisic acid related signal transduction networks (), multicellular molecular transport in Arabidopsis thaliana (), and also in synthetic biology design ().

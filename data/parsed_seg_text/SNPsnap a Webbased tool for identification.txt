An important computational step following genome wide association studies g was is to assess whether disease or trait associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) enrich for particular biological annotations. snp based enrichment analysis needs to account for biases such as co-localization of g was signals to gene dense and high linkage disequilibrium (LD) regions, and correlations of gene size, location and function. The snp snap Web server enables snp based enrichment analysis by providing matched sets of SNPs that can be used to calibrate background expectations. Specifically, snp snap efficiently identifies sets of randomly drawn SNPs that are matched to a set of query SNPs based on allele frequency, number of SNPs in LD, distance to nearest gene and gene density.

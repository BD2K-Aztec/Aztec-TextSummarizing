Mixed model based approaches to genome wide association studies g was of binary traits in related individuals can account for non genetic risk factors in an integrated manner. However, they are technically challenging. g logs genome wide LOGistic mixed model score test) addresses such challenges with efficient statistical procedures and a parallel implementation. g logs has high power relative to alternative approaches as risk covariate effects increase, and can complete a g was in minutes.

introduction although many genome wide association studies g was are of unrelated populations and do not include the effects of non genetic predictors, it is also of interest to study populations with family structures or cryptic relatedness while incorporating the effects of covariates (). Mixed model based methods represent traits as a function of observed covariates and unknown random effects and are attractive for such problems because these effects are addressed in a direct and integrated manner. In such methods, the mean of the trait is affected by the observed covariates and the genetic marker being tested, whereas the random effects influence the trait's variance and correlation structure. Early implementations of the mixed model approach for quantitative traits include SOLAR (). More recently, improvements in the efficiency of statistical methods, computing power and software engineering () have made the approach feasible for analyses of quantitative traits using genome wide data, as systems such as TASSEL () and emma x () illustrate. Given these successes, further development of mixed model methods for g was is desirable, especially for binary traits. In this article we describe genome wide LOGistic mixed model score test g logs a mixed model based system for g was of binary traits in populations with related individuals. g logs performs a g was by (1) estimating parameters of a logistic risk model based on non genetic covariates and a polygenic effect and * To whom correspondence should be addressed 2 evaluating associations between markers and the disease using score tests. Simulation studies demonstrate that this approach yields comparatively high statistical power, especially as covariate effects on risk increase. Additionally, g logs achieves a high degree of computational tractability through parallelization. g logs can complete g was in minutes, allowing investigations of a variety of possible covariates to be conducted in a timely manner.

conclusion in this article, we addressed mixed model based g was of binary traits in populations of related individuals, where risk is affected by non genetic factors. Our approach, g logs calculates maximum likelihood parameter estimates for a logistic mixed model and then uses score tests to evaluate associations. We note that alternatives exist for both of these steps (). Our use of maximum likelihood estimation is motivated by our use of the score test, which is based on maximum likelihood estimation under the null model. g logs improves upon other methods for g was of binary traits in related populations by offering direct support for risk covariates, in a system that is also powerful for studies that omit such covariates. This is demonstrated in, which suggests that g logs is roughly as powerful as the mq ls package when risk covariates have little effect, and more powerful for analyses with larger covariate effects. This is expected, as both methods are based on score tests and mq ls does not offer direct covariate support. Additionally, g logs offers fast run times due to its use of the score test and parallelization of parameter estimation procedure. Typically, the total time required to perform a g was with g logs is primarily based on parameter estimation, which is done once per analysis with run time inversely proportional to the number of processors used. Score testing is comparatively fast. In, 1000 score tests were performed in 0.1% of the time of the parameter estimation step; increasing the number of markers 100fold would yield an increased run time of 10%. In contrast, for mq ls and the methods discussed in, a 100-fold increase in the number of markers would result in approximately a 100-fold increase in run time. Consistent with other methods, run times for g logs increase with the number of individuals studied. We have used g logs in g was of over 800 highly related individuals and 250 000 markers, controlling for multiple binary, integer and continuous risk covariates. Such analyses take 20 min to perform with the computer hardware used in our simulation studies. A current version of g logs is provided at http://www.bioinformatics.org/stanhope/GLOGS.

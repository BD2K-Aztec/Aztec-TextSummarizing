py dock web is a web server for the rigid body docking prediction of protein protein complex structures using a new version of the py dock scoring algorithm. We use here a new custom parallel ft dock implementation, with adjusted grid size for optimal FFT calculations , and a new version of py dock which dramatically speeds up calculations while keeping the same predictive accuracy. Given the 3D coordinates of two interacting proteins, py dock web returns the best docking orientations as scored mainly by electrostatics and de solvation energy. Availability and implementation: The server does not require registration by the user and is freely accessible for academics at http://life. bsc es servlet py dock
introduction protein protein interactions mediate most cellular functions; thus, a detailed description of the association process at molecular level is essential to comprehend the fundamental processes that sustain life. In such line, protein protein docking tools aim to identify the native binding mode between two proteins (). Such predictions are required to complement experimental techniques that can not provide structural information at a proteomics scale given their current technical limitations. py dock () is a rigid body docking method in which sampling is performed by means of ft dock () and scoring implements an efficient empirical potential, composed of electrostatics and de solvation terms, with a limited contribution from van der Waals energy. The method has been successfully tested in CAPRI (). Here, we present py dock web server, a new fast implementation that allows easy access to non expert users to state of the art docking predictions.

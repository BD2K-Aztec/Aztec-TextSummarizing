SHAP (simple high throughput annotation pipeline) is a lightweight and scalable sequence annotation pipeline capable of supporting research efforts that generate or utilize large volumes of DNA sequence data. The software provides Grid capable analysis, relational storage and web based full text searching of annotation results. Implemented in Java, SHAP recognizes the limited resources of many smaller research groups. Availability: Source code is freely available under GPLv3 at https://sourceforge.net/projects/

introduction the development of SHAP began in early 2006, after it became apparent that the needs of our environmental genomics meta genomics program would not be satisfied by available annotation tools of the day. Automated pipelines were focused primarily on the analysis of single microbial genomes (; http://manatee.sourceforge.net) and often pursued analysis strategies that became impractical when the volume of sequencing data grew substantially beyond their original design scope. SHAP was designed around five primary requirements: relational storage, scalable high throughput analysis, a simple extensible core, platform independence and free availability; requirements that were not met by any program evaluated at the time. Recently, er gatis () and the derived annotation specific server is ga () have become available. Streamlining the capacity of er gatis is ga addresses many of the issues that motivated the creation of SHAP. However, the ambitious nature of the system makes it complex and demanding to deploy as a monolithic application. As the name implies, SHAP provides a relatively simple means of annotating high throughput DNA sequencing datasets while, at the same time, allowing for customization and expansion.

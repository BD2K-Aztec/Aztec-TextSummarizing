Motivation: Probabilistic motif detection requires a multi-step approach going from the actual de novo regulatory motif finding up to a tedious assessment of the predicted motifs. motif suite a user friendly web interface streamlines this analysis flow. Its core consists of two post-processing procedures that allow prioritizing the motif detection output. The tools offered by motif suite are built around the well established motif detection tool motif sampler and can also be used in combination with any other probabilistic motif detection tool. Elaborate guidelines on each of its applications have been provided.

introduction probabilistic methods, which search de novo for statistically overrepresented motifs in co regulated genes, have been proven successful for the prediction of regulatory motifs. Due to the presence of local optima in the search space of possible overrepresented motifs, different initializations of a deterministic algorithm, such as MEME () or different runs of a stochastic algorithm, such as motif sampler () will output non identical motif predictions even when performed under identical parameter settings. A tedious post-processing is required to extract from this set of multiple candidate predictions, the most significant ones. motif suite streamlines this multi-step approach from de novo motif detection to the assessment of motif significance.

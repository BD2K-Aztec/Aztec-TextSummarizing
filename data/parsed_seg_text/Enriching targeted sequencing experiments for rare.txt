Motivation: next generation targeted resequencing of genome wide association study g was associated genomic regions is a common approach for follow-up of indirect association of common alleles. However, it is prohibitively expensive to sequence all the samples from a well powered g was study with sufficient depth of coverage to accurately call rare genotypes. As a result, many studies may use next generation sequencing for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery in a smaller number of samples, with the intent to genotype candidate SNPs with rare alleles captured by resequencing. This approach is reasonable, but may be inefficient for rare alleles if samples are not carefully selected for the resequencing experiment. Results: We have developed a probability based approach, sample seq to select samples for a targeted resequencing experiment that increases the yield of rare disease alleles substantially over random sampling of cases or controls or sampling based on genotypes at associated SNPs from g was data. This technique allows for smaller sample sizes for resequencing experiments, or allows the capture of rarer risk alleles. When following up multiple regions, sample seq selects subjects with an even representation of all the regions. sample seq also can be used to calculate the sample size needed for the resequencing to increase the chance of successful capture of rare alleles of desired frequencies.

introduction genome wide association studies g was are based on the premise that densely genotyped common alleles will have statistical power to detect causal associations with traits at nearby, un genotyped common mutations through short range linkage disequilibrium (LD). The basis for this strategy is the common disease common variant cd cv hypothesis (). This approach has been proven to be effective in many scenarios for mapping small genomic regions to traits (see the National Human Genome * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

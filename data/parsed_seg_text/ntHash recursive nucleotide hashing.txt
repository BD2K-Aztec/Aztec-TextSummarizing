Motivation: Hashing has been widely used for indexing, querying and rapid similarity search in many bioinformatics applications, including sequence alignment, genome and transcriptome assembly , km er counting and error correction. Hence, expediting hashing operations would have a substantial impact in the field, making bioinformatics applications faster and more efficient. Results: We present nt hash a hashing algorithm tuned for processing dna rna sequences. It performs the best when calculating hash values for adjacent km ers in an input sequence, operating an order of magnitude faster than the best performing alternatives in typical use cases. Availability and implementation: nt hash is available online at http://www.bcgsc.ca/platform/bio info software nt hash and is free for academic use.

introduction hashing is a common function across many informatics applications, and refers to mapping an input key value of arbitrary size to an allocated memory of predetermined size. Among other uses, it is an enabling concept for rapid search operations, and forms the backbone of Internet search engines. In bioinformatics, it has many applications including sequence alignment, genome and transcriptome assembly, rnase q expression quantification, km er counting and error correction. large scale sequence analysis often relies on cataloguing or counting consecutive km ers in dna rna sequences for indexing, querying and similarity searching. An efficient way of implementing such operations is through the use of hash based data structures, such as hash tables or Bloom filters. Therefore, improving the performance of hashing algorithms would have a great impact in a wide range of bioinformatics tools. Here, we present nt hash a fast function for recursively computing hash values for consecutive km ers

mad gene is a software environment comprising a web based database and a java application. This platform aims at unifying gene identifiers (ids) and performing gene set analysis. mad gene allows the user to perform inter-conversion of clone and gene ids over a large range of nomenclatures relative to 17 species. We propose a set of 23 functions to facilitate the analysis of gene sets and we give two microarray applications to show how mad gene can be used to conduct meta analyses. Availability: The mad gene resources are freely available online from http://www.madtools.org, a website dedicated to the analysis and annotation of DNA microarray data.

introduction the analysis of heterogeneous data is a time consuming and tedious task. Many tools exist for mapping gene ids across several references and species (see 14 references in Supplementary Material 1). Although these resources offer many interesting options, our platform has the advantage of integrating three essential features: the capacity to annotate heterogeneous id lists, a large coverage of species and an easy to use application for investigating multiple gene lists, which includes relational operators and multiple statistical tests.

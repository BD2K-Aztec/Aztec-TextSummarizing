msn base is an r bioconductor package for the analysis of quantitative proteomics experiments that use isobaric tagging. It provides an exploratory data analysis framework for reproducible research, allowing raw data import, quality control, visualization, data processing and quantitation. msn base allows direct integration of quantitative proteomics data with additional facilities for statistical analysis provided by the Bioconductor project. Availability: msn base is implemented in R (version â‰¥2.13.0) and available at the Bioconductor web site (http://www.bioconductor .org/). Vignettes outlining typical workflows, input output capabilities and detailing underlying infrastructure are included in the package.

introduction proteomics the analysis of the entire protein complement expressed by a genome, has recently benefited from substantial technological advances (). Among the numerous approaches to interrogate proteomes, a popular technique is the quantitation of samples using isobaric tags. Nevertheless, high throughput proteomics lags behind genomics, genetics or transcript omics in terms of reproducible data analysis and development of analytical stategies. One of the challenges within proteomics is the availability of open, extensible and efficient data mining and statistical assessment environments (). Here, we introduce the msn base package, part of the Bioconductor project (). msn base extends Bioconductor with tools and data structures to import raw tandem mass spectrometry (MS2) data, perform exploratory data analysis and quantification of isobaric reporter tags. The infrastructure is compatible with existing Bioconductor core packages, incorporating available features and allowing direct utilization of additional functionality.

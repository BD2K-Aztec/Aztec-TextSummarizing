Motivation: beta lactamases confer resistance to a broad range of antibiotics and inhibitors by accumulating mutations. The number of beta lactamases and their variants is steadily increasing. The horizontal gene transfer likely plays a major role in dissemination of these markers to new environments and hosts. Moreover, information about the beta lactamase classes and their variants was scattered. Categorizing all these classes and their associated variants along with their epidemiology and resistance pattern information on one platform could be helpful to the researcher working on multidrug resistant bacteria. Thus, the beta lactamase database (BLAD) has been developed to provide comprehensive information (epidemiology and resistance pattern) on beta lactamases. beta lactamase gene sequences in BLAD are linked with structural data, phenotypic data (i.e. antibiotic resistance) and literature references to experimental studies. In summary , BLAD integrates information that may provide insight into the epidemiology of multidrug resistance and enable the designing of novel drug candidates.

introduction beta lactamases are one of the major causes of resistance against beta lactam antibiotics (). carb a pen em resistant Enterobacteriaceae has been increased in bacterial strains isolated from nosocomial infections in past 10 years (). Based on the sequence, the beta lactamases are divided into four classes AD (). Class A, C and D are serine beta lactamases whereas class B enzymes are metallo beta lactamases. Class A provides the most commonly encountered mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta lactam antibiotics. It appears to be the most widely distributed class of beta lactamases and capable of hydrolyzing penicillins and classical cephalosporins (). The genes of class B beta lactamases are implicated in the hydrolysis of cephalosporins and carb a pen ems and are located on both chromosomes and plasmids. Some of the most prevalent class B enzymes include IMP, VIM, NDM and SPN. The NDM-1 was a recent addition to this class, which was isolated from a patient hospitalized in India (). Another class of enzyme is a serine hydrolyzing class C belonging to the cephalosporin ases family, which confers resistance to broad spectrum cephalosporin including cef oxime and ceftazidime. Some of the most prevalent enzymes of this class are am pc c my ACC, produced by gram negative bacteria (). The enzyme OXA beta lactamases belongs to class D, and 240 OXA type beta lactamases have been characterized so far. Several recent efforts (Thai and p leiss 2010;) have been made to partially unify the information about the beta lactamases with limited functionalities. The main limitation of such resources is lack of information for all types of beta lactamases class. Thus, to address these limitations and to facilitate the characterization of these beta lactamases we have integrated sequence, structural and experimental information on a common platform. Although, the information available in the previously published resources are useful (), such resources do not provide the information for all types of beta lactamases. Moreover, other resources () lack the information about the 3D structures and inhibitors resistance profile of the beta lactamases. beta lactamase database (BLAD) represents the most extensive catalog for maximum type of beta lactamases (Class AD) along with other unique features such as search by source, country, type, variant along with local alignment, restriction enzyme digestion analysis tools, which are lacking in previously published databases of this kind. Hence, our annotated and updated database will provide broad information to the researchers.

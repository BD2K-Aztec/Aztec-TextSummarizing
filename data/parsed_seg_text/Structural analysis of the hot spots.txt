Motivation: Worldwide and substantial mortality caused by the 2009 H1N1 influenza A has stimulated a new surge of research on H1N1 viruses. An epitope conservation has been learned in the HA1 protein that allows antibodies to cross neutralize both 1918 and 2009 H1N1. However, few works have thoroughly studied the binding hot spots in those two antigen antibody interfaces which are responsible for the antibody cross neutralization. Results: We apply predictive methods to identify binding hot spots at the epitope sites of the HA1 proteins and at the para top e sites of the 2D1 antibody. We find that the six mutations at the HA1s epitope from 1918 to 2009 should not harm its binding to 2D1. Instead, the change of binding free energy on the whole exhibits an increased tendency after these mutations, making the binding stronger. This is consistent with the observation that the 1918 H1N1 neutralizing antibody can cross react with 2009 H1N1. We identified three distinguished hot spot residues, including Lys 166 , common between the two epitopes. These common hot spots again can explain why 2D1 cross reacted. We believe that these hot spot residues are mutation candidates which may help H1N1 viruses to evade the immune system. We also identified eight residues at the para top e site of 2D1, five from its heavy chain and three from its light chain, that are predicted to be energetically important in the HA1 recognition. The identification of these hot spot residues and their structural analysis are potentially useful to fight against H1N1 viruses.

introduction the H1N1 influenza A caused two notable pandemics with substantial mortality in 1918 and 2009. Fortunately, it has been * To whom correspondence should be addressed found that some antibodies can work against the Hemagglutinin (HA) proteins in these two pandemics (). HA is a homo trimeric glycoprotein. HA monomers are synthesized as precursors that are then cleaved into two proteins, HA1 and HA2, which form the major surface proteins of influenza A viruses. The infection is started by the binding of HA proteins to the sialic acid containing receptors of target cells and by fusing the viral membrane with the endosomal membrane of the target cells. The viral genome enters and infects the target cells after the binding. So, inhibiting this binding by antibodies is an important way against flu. Previous works have learned that there is an epitope (binding site) conservation that exists between the 1918 and 2009 H1N1 HA proteins (). Such epitope conservation enables the older population to avoid infection from 2009 H1N1 because their pre-existing immunity against 1918 H1N1 can neutralize the 2009 H1N1 HA proteins. Thus, studies on these antibody ha binding interfaces are crucial to understand how the antibodies recognize the antigens. However, there are few studies on the energetic importance of the binding residues in the HA1 protein in complex with the 2D1 antibody. We apply predictive and comparative methods to examine the interfaces between the 2D1 antibody and the HA1 proteins of 1918 and 2009 H1N1, and to investigate an assumed 2D1 binding to the seasonal influenza virus a brisbane 592007 to understand why 2D1 did not bind to the 2007 strain (). This 2D1 antibody is a monoclonal antibody from a survivor of the 1918 Spanish influenza (), which is believed to bind to HA1s in both of 1918 and 2009 H1N1. Of particular interests, we identify binding hot spot residues from the above mentioned two antibody antigen interfaces. A binding hot spot is a small fraction of interfacial residues that contribute most to binding free energy (). Their mutations eg. alanine mutations can reduce binding affinity remarkably (). We address the problems whether the interfacial mutations from 1918 H1N1's HA1 to 2009's are hot spot residues and whether these mutations make the binding stronger with 2D1. We explain how the computational methods find those antigenic residues that are energetically important in the antibody binding, such as Asn 129 , Lys 157 and Lys 166. These three hot spot residues are actually common between the 1918 and 2009 epitopes of HA1. Their mutations may make the 2d1 antibody binding ineffective.

conclusion we have done a structural analysis on the interfaces between the 2D1 antibody and the HA1 proteins of 2009 H1N1 and 1918 H1N1. The cross neutralization of this antibody is clearly demonstrated by the hot spot residues common in the two binding interfaces. Our comprehensive investigation suggests that there are six outstanding epitope residues whose mutations will help H1N1 evade capture by this antibody. We further pinpointed the hot spot residues at the para top e site of the 2D1 antibody which are responsible for the antigen recognition. The understanding of these hot spot residues can potentially facilitate drug design to neutralize influenza viruses.

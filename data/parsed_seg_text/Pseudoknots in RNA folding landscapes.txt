Motivation: The function of an RNA molecule is not only linked to its native structure, which is usually taken to be the ground state of its folding landscape, but also in many cases crucially depends on the details of the folding pathways such as stable folding intermediates or the timing of the folding process itself. To model and understand these processes, it is necessary to go beyond ground state structures. The study of rugged RNA folding landscapes holds the key to answer these questions. Efficient coarse graining methods are required to reduce the in tract ably vast energy landscapes into condensed representations such as barrier trees or basin hopping graphs (BHG) that convey an approximate but comprehensive picture of the folding kinetics. So far, exact and heuris-tic coarse graining methods have been mostly restricted to the pseudoknot free secondary structures. pseudo knots which are common motifs and have been repeatedly hypothesized to play an important role in guiding folding trajectories, were usually excluded. Results: We generalize the BHG framework to include pseudo knotted RNA structures and systematically study the differences in predicted folding behavior depending on whether pseudo knotted structures are allowed to occur as folding intermediates or not. We observe that RNAs with pseudo knotted ground state structures tend to have more pseudo knotted folding intermediates than RNAs with pseudoknot free ground state structures. The occurrence and influence of pseudo knotted intermediates on the folding pathway, however, appear to depend very strongly on the individual RNAs so that no general rule can be inferred.

introduction beyond the role as carriers of genetic information, RNA molecules often play much more active roles in regulating gene expression, intracellular transport and even as catalysts (). More often than not, these functions are associated with the RNAs' ability to undergo specific conformational changes, as is the case for ribo switches. The function of an RNA molecule thus is often poorly described by its ground state structure and instead has to be studied as a dynamic ensemble of structures ().

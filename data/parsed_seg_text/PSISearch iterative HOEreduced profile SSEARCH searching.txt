Iterative similarity searches with PSI-BLAST position specific score matrices ps sms find many more homologs than single searches, but ps sms can be contaminated when homologous alignments are extended into unrelated protein domains homologous over extension (HOE). psi search combines an optimal smith waterman local alignment sequence search, using s search with the PSI-BLAST profile construction strategy. An optional sequence boundary masking procedure, which prevents alignments from being extended after they are initially included, can reduce HOE errors in the PSSM profile. Preventing HOE improves selectivity for both PSI-BLAST and psi search but psi search has ∼4-fold better selectivity than PSI-BLAST and similar sensitivity at 50% and 60% family coverage. psi search is also produces 2 for 4-fold fewer false positives than jack hmmer but is ∼5% less sensitive.

introduction psiblast () uses an iterative strategy to construct a protein profile, in the form of a position specific score matrix (PSSM), which dramatically improves homology detection in diverse protein families. Improved versions of PSI-BLAST have more accurate statistics and more sensitive consensus profiles (), but the most common cause of PSI-BLAST errors is contamination of the PSSM by extension of an homologous domain into a non-homologous region (homologous over extension HOE) (). Even searches with a single well defined domain do not guarantee uncontaminated profiles (). Some HOE errors can be reduced by 'profile cleaning';) focuses on long insertions, but requires insertion boundaries to be specified by the user, thus assuming a priori knowledge of the domain structure of the query protein.

Motivation: Systems biology employs mathematical modelling to further our understanding of biochemical pathways. Since the amount of experimental data on which the models are parameterized is often limited, these models exhibit large uncertainty in both parameters and predictions. Statistical methods can be used to select experiments that will reduce such uncertainty in an optimal manner. However, existing methods for optimal experiment design (OED) rely on assumptions that are inappropriate when data are scarce considering model complexity. Results: We have developed a novel method to perform OED for models that cope with large parameter uncertainty. We employ a Bayesian approach involving importance sampling of the posterior predictive distribution to predict the efficacy of a new measurement at reducing the uncertainty of a selected prediction. We demonstrate the method by applying it to a case where we show that specific combinations of experiments result in more precise predictions.

introduction computational models can be used to predict (un)measured behaviour or system responses and formalize hypotheses in a testable manner. To be able to make predictions parameters are required. Despite the development of new quantitative experimental techniques, data are often relatively scarce. Consequently the modeller is faced with a situation where large regions of parameter space can describe the measured data to an acceptable degree (;). This is not a problem when the predictions required for testing the hypothesis (which we shall refer to as predictions of interest) are well constrained (). When this is not the case more data will be required. Optimal experiment design (OED) methods can be used to determine which experiments would be most useful in order to perform statistical inference. Classical design criteria are often based on linearization around a best fit parameter set () and * To whom correspondence should be addressed. pertain to effectively constraining the parameters () or predictions (). However, when data are scarce considering the model complexity or the model is strongly non-linear, such methods are not appropriate (). This makes investigating the role of parameter uncertainty in OED a relevant topic to explore. We propose a method for experimental design that overcomes these issues by adopting a probabilistic approach which incorporates prediction uncertainty. Our method enables the modeller to target experimental efforts in order to selectively reduce the uncertainty of predictions of interest. Using our approach, multiple experiments can be designed simultaneously revealing potential benefits that might arise from specific combinations of experiments. We focus on biochemical networks that can be modelled using a system of ordinary differential equations. These models comprise of equations f ( x(t), u(t), p) which contain parameters p (constant in time), inputs u(t) and state variables x(t). Given a set of parameters, inputs and initial conditions x(0) these equations can subsequently be simulated. Measurements y(t) are performed on a subset and or a combination of the total number of states in the model. Measurements are hampered by measurement noise  while many techniques used in biology (e.g. western blotting) necessitate the use of scaling and offset parameters q (). We define  as  ={ p, q, x 0 }, which lists all the required variables to simulate the model in order to perform inference and experiment design an error model is required. For ease of notation we shall demonstrate our method using a Gaussian error model. If we consider M time series of length N 1 , N 2 , ..., N M hampered by such noise, we obtain Equation (4) for the probability density function of the output data. Here y t is the true system with true parameters  t , where  i,j indicates the SD of a specific data point and K serves as a normalization constant using Bayes' theorem, we obtain an expression for the posterior probability distribution over the parameters ().

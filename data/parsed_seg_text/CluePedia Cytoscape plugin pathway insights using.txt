The clue pedia Cytoscape plugin is a search tool for new markers potentially associated to pathways. clue pedia calculates linear and non-linear statistical dependencies from experimental data. Genes, proteins and miRNAs can be connected based on in silico and or experimental information and integrated into a clue go network of terms pathways. Interrelations within each pathway can be investigated, and new potential associations may be revealed through gene protein mirna enrichments. A pathway like visualization can be created using the Cerebral plugin layout. Combining all these features is essential for data interpretation and the generation of new hypotheses. The clue pedia Cytoscape plugin is user friendly and has an expressive and intuitive visualization. Availability: http://www.ici.upmc.fr/cluepedia/ and via the Cytoscape plugin manager. The user manual is available at the clue pedia
introduction integrating heterogeneous expression data and functional network information is essential for understanding cellular processes and their dynamics. Within the versatile framework of Cytoscape (), tools for ontology analysis () and gene function predictions () were developed. clue pedia provides a comprehensive view on a pathway or process by investigating experimental and in silico data from different perspectives: gene interrelations, miRNAs regulatory aspects, protein protein interactions, as well as the functional context, in conjunction with clue go ().

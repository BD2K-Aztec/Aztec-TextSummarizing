Motivation: exo me sequencing has proven to be an effective tool to discover the genetic basis of Mendelian disorders. It is well established that copy number variants cn vs contribute to the etiology of these disorders. However, calling cn vs from exo me sequence data is challenging. A typical read depth strategy consists of using another sample (or a combination of samples) as a reference to control for the variability at the capture and sequencing steps. However, technical variability between samples complicates the analysis and can create spurious CNV calls. Results: Here, we introduce exo me depth a new CNV calling algorithm designed to control for this technical variability. exo me depth uses a robust model for the read count data and uses this model to build an optimized reference set in order to maximize the power to detect cn vs. As a result, exo me depth is effective across a wider range of exo me datasets than the previously existing tools, even for small (e.g. one to two exons) and heterozygous deletions. We used this new approach to analyse exo me data from 24 patients with primary immunodeficiencies. Depending on data quality and the exact target region, we find between 170 and 250 exonic CNV calls per sample. Our analysis identified two novel causative deletions in the genes GATA2 and DOCK8. Availability: The code used in this analysis has been implemented into an R package called exo me depth and is available at the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).

introduction the improvement of DNA sequencing technologies in recent years has radically changed the identification of genetic variants associated with human diseases and in particular, rare disorders (). The use of sequence capture technologies to target protein coding regions in the human genome followed by high throughput DNA sequencing (known as exo me sequencing) currently provides a cost efficient approach to discover causal mutations in patients with Mendelian disorders. The majority of published work using exo me sequence data focuses on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or small insertions deletions (indels), mostly because short read DNA sequencing technologies are best suited to call these variants. Nevertheless, copy number variants cn vs e.g. larger chromosomal indels, also significantly contribute to the aetiology of Mendelian disorders. Three general strategies exist to call cn vs from short read sequence data (): split reads (), paired end reads () and read depth approaches (). Read depth analysis is particularly effective for exo me data as it does not rely on sequencing into or near the CNV breakpoints. Generally speaking, read depth based approaches for CNV calling compare the number of reads mapping to a chromosome window with its expectation under a statistical model. Deviations from this expectation are indicative of CNV calls. Similar to the array comparative genomic hybridization a cgh methodology, the ratio of read count between a test and a reference sample is usually preferred to a single sample analysis in order to control for the typically extensive variability in capture efficiency across exons (). Most of the existing tools for CNV calling that are based on read depth, such as exo me cnv () and cnv seq (), make Gaussian assumptions about the distribution of read count ratio. In the absence of technical variability, the proportion of reads matching to a specific sample should follow a binomial distribution whose success rate is determined by genome wide read count ratio between the test sample and the reference set, as well as the potential presence of cn vs. Additional covariates, such as GC content, can alter this success rate in situations where the effects of these covariates vary across samples (). Here, we evaluate two different exo me sequence datasets and show that Gaussian assumptions generally do not hold. Technical variability at the library preparation, capture and sequencing creates noise that affects the numbers of reads matching to *To whom correspondence should be addressed.  The Author 2012.

As a result, the observed variance exceeds what is predicted by a binomial model that affects the CNV calls. Motivated by this observation, we propose a modified and more robust statistical framework for CNV calling. We apply this model to provide guidelines for the construction of an optimized reference sequence dataset for CNV calling purposes, as well as realistic power estimates. We find that two main factors improve statistical power: increasing the read depth and controlling for any source of technical variability across samples at the capture and sequencing steps. We have developed and coded a new set of tools in an R package called exo me depth. We then illustrated its efficiency by discovering novel small causative cn vs in two patients with primary immunodeficiencies, a heterozygous deletion of two exons of the GATA2 gene and a single exon homozygous deletion in the DOCK8 gene.

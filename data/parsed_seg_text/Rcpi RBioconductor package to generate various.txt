In chemo informatics and bioinformatics fields, one of the main computational challenges in various predictive modeling is to find a suitable way to effectively represent the molecules under investigation , such as small molecules, proteins and even complex interactions. To solve this problem, we developed a freely available r bioconductor package, called compound protein Interaction with R rcp i for complex molecular representation from drugs, proteins and more complex interactions, including protein protein and compoundâ€“ protein interactions. rcp i could calculate a large number of structural and physicochemical features of proteins and peptides from amino acid sequences, molecular descriptors of small molecules from their topology and protein protein interaction and compound protein interaction descriptors. In addition to main functionalities, rcp i could also provide a number of useful auxiliary utilities to facilitate the users need. With the descriptors calculated by this package, the users could conveniently apply various statistical machine learning methods in R to solve various biological and drug research questions in computational biology and drug discovery. Availability and implementation: rcp i is freely available from the Bioconductor site

introduction to develop a powerful model for prediction tasks, one of the most important things to consider is how to effectively represent the molecules under investigation such as small molecules, proteins and even complex interactions, by a descriptor. In the field of chemo informatics molecular descriptors for small molecules have frequently been used in quantitative structure activity property relationship qsar q spr virtual screening, database search, ranking, drug ADME/T prediction and other drug discovery processes (). These descriptors capture and magnify distinct aspects of molecular topology to investigate how molecular structures affect molecular properties. In the field of bioinformatics, sequence derived structural and physicochemical features have been widely used for predicting protein structural and functional classes, protein protein interactions, subcellular locations and peptides of specific properties, etc (). These features are highly useful for representing and distinguishing proteins or peptides of different structural, functional and interaction profiles. Currently, their combinations were routinely used to characterize drug target interactions and predict new drug target associations to identify potential drug targets (), following the spirit of chemo genomics. Several programs for computing molecular features have been developed, such as tops mode c info ny Dragon, codes sa pro feat BioJava, BioPython, pse aac prop y etc (). Although a number of tools, which are either open sources or commercial softwares, have been developed and widely used in the two fields, their applications only focus on the analysis of either small molecules or proteins. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no open source code or tools available for the integration and analysis of increasingly popular interaction problems. We developed a comprehensive molecular representation tool, called compound protein Interaction with R rcp i to emphasize the integration of chemo informatics and bioinformatics into a chemo genomics platform for drug discovery. rcp i mainly focuses on the study of molecular representation techniques for not only small molecules and proteins but also interactions of protein protein and compound protein. We recommend rcp i to analyze and represent various complex molecular data under investigation. Further, we hope that the package will be helpful when exploring questions concerning structures, functions and interactions of various molecular data in the context of systems biology.

discussion rcp i contains a selection of molecular descriptors to analyze, classify and compare complex molecular network in the context of network biology pharmacology. They facilitate to exploit machine learning techniques to drive hypothesis from complex molecular datasets. The usefulness of these molecular descriptors covered by rcp i for representing structural features of various molecular data has been sufficiently demonstrated by a number of published studies of the development of machine learning prediction systems. In the future work, we plan to apply integrated features on various biological and drug research questions, and extend the range of functions with new promising descriptors for the coming versions of rcp i

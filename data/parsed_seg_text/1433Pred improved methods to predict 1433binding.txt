Motivation: The 14-3-3 family of phosphoprotein binding proteins regulates many cellular processes by docking onto pairs of phosphorylated Ser and Thr residues in a constellation of intracellu-lar targets. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop new prediction methods that use an updated set of 1433 binding motifs for the identification of new 14-3-3 targets and to prioritize the downstream analysis of 2000 potential interactors identified in high throughput experiments.

introduction the 14-3-3 phosphoprotein binding proteins interact with many intracellular targets. Changes in the engagement of 14-3-3s with different sets of target phosphoproteins cause coordinated shifts in cellular behaviour in response to growth factors and other stimuli (). 14-3-3s are boat shaped dimers that dock onto specific pairs of phosphorylated Ser and Thr residues (). The phospho site pairs are often located in tandem on the same target protein and are typically 15 amino acid residues apart to allow engagement with both docking sites in the central groove of the 14-3-3 dimer (). The 14-3-3s also have strong preferences with respect V C The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press.

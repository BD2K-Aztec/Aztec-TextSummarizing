Motivation: b cell receptor repertoire profiling is an important tool for understanding the biology of diverse immunologic processes. Current methods for analyzing adaptive immune receptor repertoires depend upon PCR amplification of VDJ rearrangements followed by long read amplicon se-quencing spanning the VDJ junctions. While this approach has proven to be effective, it is frequently not feasible due to cost or limited sample material. Additionally, there are many existing datasets where short read RNA sequencing data are available but PCR amplified BCR data are not. Results: We present here vd jer an assembly based method that reconstructs adaptive immune receptor repertoires from short read RNA sequencing data. This method captures expressed b cell receptor loci from a standard rnase q assay. We applied this method to 473 Melanoma samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas and demonstrate vdj ers ability to accurately reconstruct b cell receptor repertoires from short read mrna seq data.

introduction t cells and b cells compose the adaptive immune system and bear highly specific cell surface receptors that allow them to recognize antigenic targets. Massive diversity at the adaptive immune receptor loci is generated by the process of V-J and V-D-J recombination during cell development, with a theoretical number of unique receptors for each class estimated at greater than 10 15 and lower bounds for circulating lymphocytes measured at greater than 10 6 (). This extraordinary diversity is achieved through recombination of V, D and J segments, insertions and deletions at junction points, as well as somatic hypermutation in the case of b cell receptors (BCR) (Supplemental). This diversity of targeting receptors is crucial for immune defense against infectious pathogens and has implications for understanding autoimmunity, immunodeficiency syndromes, and the anti-tumor immune response to malignant diseases. Adaptive immune receptor repertoire analysis was initially performed by evaluating differences in sequence length of the primary antigen binding region, a process known as spectra typing (),  The Author(s) 2016.

discussion we present here the vd jer software for inference of b cell receptor repertoires using short read RNA sequencing data. A major advantage of this approach is the capacity to capture expressed b cell receptor loci in a standard rnase q assay. This is especially important in application to clinical samples where nucleic acid template may be limiting. In contrast to assays that depend on PCR amplification, vd jer is not limited to evaluating only those sequences that can be successfully primed. vd jer does not require FACS sorting of b cells prior to analysis; rather it performs well when analyzing complex RNA template mixtures derived from the bulk tumor immune microenvironment. Application of vd jer is primarily limited by read coverage of the clones of interest. In the setting of high coverage, assembly sensitivity and specificity are high as well, however in areas of low coverage sensitivity lessens. Thus in the context of a tumor immune infiltrate, vd jer is best suited for reconstruction of dominant and subdominant clones. The algorithm allows for wide latitude in choosing parameters for optimal performance given the expected coverage in the sample, however there is a lower bound on coverage for recovering a given clo no type in the assembly. Functional b cell receptors are protein multimers, comprising heavy chain and kappa or lambda light chain pairing. Recently multiple methods have been developed to capture paired heavy light chain information (or paired alphabet a chains in the context of t cell receptor repertoires) (). vd jer does not attempt this pairing. Other assembly based methods have been used to analyze adaptive immune receptor repertoires. The first of these was is sake developed, which assembled short read mrna seq data derived from sequencing 5' RACE products to reconstruct TCR repertoires (). This method has not to our knowledge been applied to b cell receptor loci. A second method used the Trinity assembly algorithm to reconstruct dominant IgH sequences and analyze somatic hypermutation of their variable regions in chronic lymphocytic leukemia samples (). vd jer showed superior performance to this method in the context of bulk rnase q data including reads from a diverse underlying BCR repertoire. Additionally, other tools have been developed to perform a selective local assembly based upon km er or read extraction. For example, a method used for crisp r detection in bacteria and archaea identifies and clusters frequently occurring km ers for assembly (Ben). Adaptive immune receptor repertoire profiling in general is an important analytical tool for translational cancer biology. Our group and others have shown that b cell lineage gene expression signatures are strongly prognostic in multiple solid tumor types (). b cell receptor variable region mutation rate is prognostic in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (), and adaptive immune receptor repertoire profiling provides the most sensitive method of detecting minimal residual disease in b cell leukemias (). Applied to a large melanoma mrna seq dataset, vd jer allowed discovery of prognostic information in tumor infiltrating BCR repertoire diversity over and above BCR expression alone. Given the huge clinical interest in this immunotherapy approach and limited material of many pre-treatment tumor biopsy samples, vd jer will be critical for adaptive immune receptor analysis for understanding response to immunotherapy and developing biomarkers to guide treatment decisions.

Transcription activator like effector nucleases (TALENs) have become an accepted tool for targeted mutagenesis, but undesired off targets remain an important issue. We present talen offer a novel tool for the genome wide prediction of TALEN off targets. We show that talen offer successfully predicts known off targets of engineered TALENs and yields a competitive runtime, scanning complete mamma-lian genomes within a few minutes. Availability: talen offer is available as a command line program from

introduction the DNA binding domain of transcription activator like (TAL) effectors is composed of highly conserved tandem repeats, where amino acids 12 and 13 of a repeat repeat variable di residue rvd determine DNA binding specificity. Each repeat binds to 1 bp of the DNA in a contiguous non-overlapping fashion (). Recently, we developed tal getter a tool for predicting putative targets of natural TAL effectors, and we showed that this tool achieves an improved prediction accuracy compared with previous approaches (). The DNA binding domain of TAL effectors can be fused with a Fok1 endonuclease domain to yield TAL effector nucleases (TALENs), where homo or hetero-dimers of TALENs need to bind to opposite strands of the DNA in 5 0 3 0 orientation and in a restricted distance range to specifically cut the DNA double strand. TALENs have been established as a second genome editing technique besides zinc finger nucleases (). Although the binding of TALENs is highly specific, undesired off targets in addition to the targeted genomic region remain an important issue () that may cause severe side effects. Hence, tools for the computational prediction of TALEN off targets have been developed, namely, id tale (http://idtale.kaust.edu.sa) and Paired Target Finder (PTF) [https://tale-nt.cac.cornell.edu,. Here, we only consider PTF because the 'Search for TALEN target' application of id tale is not applicable to custom input data. In this article, we present talen offer an alternative tool for predicting TALEN off targets. talen offer applies the statistical model of tal getter to the more complex problem of TALEN off target prediction. This requires novel methods for ranking off targets and accelerated scanning approaches to achieve acceptable runtimes, which are explained in the following section. within this window. Whenever we find a hit, i.e. s 1 ! t 1 , we also scan the reverse complement of the downstream sequence for sufficiently good hits, given the second monomer y 2 within the user specified distance range. The scanning approach of talen offer is based on this naive approach but uses a speed up strategy, which is illustrated in for one TALEN monomer. Given the TALEN monomer, we compute a partial score for each possible 8mer prefix and store it in lookup table 1, together with the information whether a target site with this prefix may yield a sufficiently large total score s i (details in Supplementary Methods). For lookup table 2, we proceed in complete analogy using partially overlapping 8mer in fixes. Both lookup tables can be accessed efficiently, given the prefix and in fix of a putative monomer target site. Scanning input sequences for off target sites, we test whether both lookup tables indicate that the putative target site under the sliding window might exceed threshold t 1. If this is the case, we only need to compute the remaining score for the nucleotides beyond look up to yield the total score s 1. If s 1 exceeds the threshold, we apply the same strategy for putative target sites of the second monomer on the opposite strand within the user specified distance range. In addition to this speed up strategy, talen offer is multithreaded to allow for simultaneously loading, parsing and scanning input data.

conclusion we present talen offer a novel tool for the genome wide prediction of TALEN targets and off targets which successfully predicts known off targets of engineered TALENs and yields a competitive runtime. talen offer is implemented using the open source Java library j stacs () and is available as a command line program and as a Galaxy () web application, which can also be installed to a local Galaxy server. Conflict of interest: JB is part owner of a patent application regarding the use of TAL effectors.. speed up strategy of talen offer. Two lookup tables of partial scores are represented by boxes, where the light shaded part of lookup table 2 serves as condition for computing the partial likelihood of the dark shaded part. The rightmost part of the putative off target site only needs to be considered if both lookup tables indicate a score above the threshold

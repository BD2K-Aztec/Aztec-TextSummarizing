Motivation: Nucleotide sequence data are being produced at an ever increasing rate. Clustering such sequences by similarity is often an essential first step in their analysis intended to reduce redundancy , define gene families or suggest taxonomic units. Exact clustering algorithms, such as hierarchical clustering, scale relatively poorly in terms of run time and memory usage, yet they are desirable because heuristic shortcuts taken during clustering might have unin-tended consequences in later analysis steps. Results: Here we present hpcc lust a highly optimized software pipeline that can cluster large numbers of pre aligned DNA sequences by running on distributed computing hardware. It allocates both memory and computing resources efficiently, and can process more than a million sequences in a few hours on a small cluster. Availability and implementation: Source code and binaries are freely available at http://meringlab.org/software/hpc-clust/; the pipeline is implemented in Cþþ and uses the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard for distributed computing.

introduction the time complexity of hierarchical clustering algorithms (HCA) is quadratic ON 2  or even worse ON 2 log N, depending on the selected cluster linkage method (). However, HCAs have a number of advantages that make them attractive for applications in biology: (i) they are well defined and should be reproducible across implementations, (ii) they require nothing but a pairwise distance matrix as input and (iii) they are agglomerative, meaning that sets of clusters at arbitrary similarity thresholds can be extracted quickly by post-processing, once a complete clustering run has been executed. Consequently, HCAs have been widely adopted in biology, in areas ranging from data mining to sequence analysis to evolutionary biology. Apart from generic implementations, a number of hierarchical clustering implementations exist that focus on biological sequence data, taking advantage of the fact that distances between sequences can be computed relatively cheaply, even in a transient fashion. However, the existing implementations such as mo thur (), ESPRIT () or RDP online clustering (), all struggle with large sets of sequences. In light of these performance limits, heuristic optimizations have also been implemented such as cd hit () and uc lust (). Hierarchical clustering starts by considering every sequence separately and merging the two closest ones into a cluster. Then, iteratively, larger clusters are formed, by joining the closest sequences and or clusters. The distance between two clusters with several sequences will depend on the clustering linkage chosen. In single linkage, it is the similarity between the two most similar sequences; in complete linkage, between the two most dissimilar sequences; and in average linkage, the average of all pairwise similarities. The latter method is also known as the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) and is often used in the construction of phylogenetic guide trees. In the type of approach used by cd hit and uc lust each input sequence is considered sequentially, and is either added to an existing cluster (if it is found to meet the clustering threshold) or is used as a seed to start a new cluster. Although this approach is extremely efficient, it can lead to some undesired characteristics (): (i) it will create clusters with sequences that may be more dissimilar than the chosen clustering threshold; (ii) it can occur that a new cluster is created close to an existing cluster, but at a distance just slightly longer than the clustering threshold; at this point, any new sequences close to both clusters will be split among the two clusters, whereas previous sequences will have been added to only the first cluster; this effectively results in a reduction of the clustering threshold locally; and (iii) different sequence input orders will result in different sets of clusters due to different choices of the seed sequences. Point (i) also affects HCA using single linkage and to a lesser extent average linkage, but does not occur with complete linkage. Here we present a distributed implementation of an HCA that can handle large numbers of sequences. It can compute single-, complete and average linkage clusters in a single run and produces a merge log from which clusters can subsequently be parsed at any threshold. In contrast to cd hit uc lust and ESPRIT, which all take unaligned sequence data as their input, hpcc lust (like mo thur takes as input a set of pre aligned sequences. This allows for flexibility in the choice of alignment algorithm; a future version of hpcc lust may include the alignment step as well.

conclusion clustering is often among the first steps when dealing with raw sequence data, and therefore needs to be as fast and as memory efficient as possible. The implementation of a distributed version of hierarchical clustering in hpcc lust makes it now possible to fully cluster a much larger number of sequences, essentially limited only by the number of available computing nodes.

mp theory Java library is an open source project collecting a set of objects and algorithms for modeling observed dynamics by means of the Metabolic P (MP) theory, that is, a mathematical theory introduced in 2004 for modeling biological dynamics. By means of the library, it is possible to model biological systems both at continuous and at discrete time. Moreover, the library comprises a set of regression algorithms for inferring MP models starting from time series of observations. To enhance the modeling experience, beside a pure Java usage, the library can be directly used within the most popular computing environments, such as MATLAB, GNU Octave, Mathematica and R. Availability and implementation: The library is open source and licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) Version 3.0. Source code, binaries and complete documentation are available at http://mptheory.

introduction systems biology has been brought to the forefront of life science research (). At the core of systems biology lies the development of models describing biological systems (). The definition of such models is often a laborious task, which involves the use of numerical, statistical and mathematical analysis (). The Java library herein presented implements a Metabolic P (MP) solution to this task, by combining an initial intuition based on rewriting rules with linear algebra methods and statistical regression. The presented software extends the modeling functionalities provided by meta plab an open source standalone Java application based on MP theory, that has been firstly released in 2008 (http://mplab. sci univ r it. With respect to meta plab the library provides the implementation of new regression algorithms and supports new types of MP models (e.g. based on differential equations, both Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) and Delay Differential Equations (DDEs)). The MP theory is a mathematical theory introduced in 2004 for modeling biological dynamics (). The letter 'P' comes from Pa  un's P systems, a particular type of computational model inspired to the functioning of biological cells (). MP models inherit from P systems a native similitude with the functioning of a living cell. This closeness permits to define models that are comprehensible (for both mathematicians and biologists) and consistent with the intrinsic structure of the phenomena under examination. The MP theory has been initially defined for modeling metabolic systems, however, it has then been extended along different directions and now it constitutes a framework for modeling any kind of dynamics ().

conclusion we presented a new open source Java library for modeling biological dynamics by means of the MP theory. The software is distributed with a Javadoc documentation and a 100 pages user guide that introduces different modeling scenarios and discusses a comprehensive set of examples. The library can be directly used within the most popular computing environments, such as MATLAB, GNU Octave, Mathematica and R.

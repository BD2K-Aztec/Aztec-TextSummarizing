An analysis of gene set [e.g. Gene Ontology (GO)] enrichment assumes that all genes are sampled independently from each other with the same probability. These assumptions are violated in genome wide association (GWA) studies since (i) longer genes typically have more single nucleotide polymorphisms resulting in a higher probability of being sampled and (ii) overlapping genes are sampled in clusters. Herein, we introduce go wind a a software specifically designed to test for enrichment of gene sets in GWA studies. We show that GO tests on GWA data could result in a substantial number of false positive GO terms. Permutation tests implemented in go wind a eliminate these biases, but maintain sufficient power to detect enrichment of GO terms. Since sufficient resolution for large datasets requires millions of permutations, we use multi-threading to keep computation times reasonable. Availability and implementation: go wind a is implemented in Java (v1.6) and freely available on

introduction the advent of high throughput analysis such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays and next generation sequencing enabled large scale genome wide association (GWA) studies () or gwa like studies, such as selective genotyping () and experimental evolution (), for almost any phenotype of interest. These studies typically yield hundreds of candidate SNPs associated with the studied trait. A wide-spread approach to shed light on the biological implications of these SNPs is a test for gene set enrichment [e.g. Gene Ontology (GO)] (). Such an analysis of gene set enrichment is based on the assumptions that all genes are sampled independently from each other with the same probability. These assumptions are violated with data from GWA studies as (i) longer genes usually have more SNPs resulting in a higher probability of being sampled and (ii) overlapping genes are sampled in clusters ().

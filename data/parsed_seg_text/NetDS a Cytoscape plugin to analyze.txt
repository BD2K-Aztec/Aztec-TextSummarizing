net ds is a novel Cytoscape plugin that conveniently simulates dynamics related to robustness, and examines structural properties with respect to feedforward feedback loops. It can evaluate how robustly a network sustains a stable state against mutations by employing a Boolean network model. In addition, the plugin can examine all feedforward feedback loops appearing in a network and determine whether or not a pair of loops is coupled. Random networks can also be generated to evaluate whether or not an interesting finding in real biological networks is significantly random.

introduction cytoscape () is a free open source software platform that is used to visualize complex networks. Many Cytoscape plugins have been developed for structural analysis of biological networks. For example, m code (), bin om () and NeMo () were developed to search specific sub-structures in a network including active parts or densely connected regions. network motif finder () has also been employed to uncover simple network motifs such as small scale feedforward loops. The motif search function was further extended in net match () by enabling a user to query more flexible forms of motifs. Plugins to analyze the dynamics of a biological network also exist. For example, perturbation analyzer () can evaluate the propagation effect of perturbations on interaction networks by computing changes in the equilibrium state. sim bool net () can examine the dynamics of a signaling transduction pathway using a Boolean network. However, there are no plugins that may be used to investigate the relationships between the structural characteristics of networks and network dynamics. Considering that the dynamical behavior of a biological network is closely related to its structural characteristics (), there is a pressing need to develop such plugins that can analyze relationships between the structural characteristics and dynamics of a network. * To whom correspondence should be addressed in particular, recent studies indicate that the ability of a network to sustain a stable state against mutations is greatly affected by complex motifs such as feedback loops f bls and feedforward loops (FFLs) harbored by the network. For example, robust networks tend to have a larger number of positive f bls and a smaller number of negative f bls () The number of f bls involving a node is also positively correlated with the functional importance of the node (), and the coherent coupling of f bls is a design principle of a robust cell signaling network (Kwon and Cho 2008a). FFLs are needed for robust carbohydrate uptake in Escherichia coli (). Inspired by those studies, we have developed a plugin, net ds to analyze the structural characteristics of biological networks with respect to f bls or FFLs and to compute dynamics related to robustness. A random Boolean network (RBN) model is employed which has been effectively used for investigating the complex dynamics of biological networks (). In fact, sim bool net has already been implemented in an RBN model to simulate the dynamics of signaling transduction. More specifically, sim bool net observes the response of downstream molecules simulated for a user specified stimulus for a signal receptor. However, it can not provide any dynamics related to attractors to which a network will converge since it simply provides the time series of changes of node values. As such, the robustness of the network against perturbations can not be calculated. To overcome this limitation, net ds was designed to analyze the converging state of a network and its robustness against perturbations. In terms of structural analysis, net ds can analyze both the f bls ffls that appear in a network and detailed properties such as the sign of an FBL, the signs of simple paths comprising an FFL, and the coherence of coupled f bls or FFLs. In addition, fbl ffls containing specific nodes can not be easily checked with existing plugins. Altogether, net ds provides a combined analysis of structural properties with respect to fbl ffls and dynamics related to robustness.

conclusion many recent results have shown that robust behavior against perturbations is closely related to structural properties with respect to the fbl ffls in biological networks. In this regard, we developed a novel Cytoscape plugin that can compute network robustness against initial state or update rule perturbations and examine fbl ffls harbored in a network. net ds is the first Cytoscape plugin to investigate the relationships between dynamic and structural properties in a network. In the future, net ds will be extended to include a variety of perturbation types and update rules that can be applied to dynamics analysis.). net ds has two control panels. One is to examine dynamical properties (finding attractors and calculating robustness) and the other is to detect structural properties with respect to FBL and FFL. A relationship between dynamical properties and structural properties can be discovered.

Motivation: To date, gene set analysis approaches primarily focus on identifying differentially expressed gene sets (pathways). Methods for identifying differentially coexpressed pathways also exist but are mostly based on aggregated pairwise correlations or other pairwise measures of coexpression. Instead, we propose Gene Sets Net Correlations Analysis gsn ca a multivariate differential coexpression test that accounts for the complete correlation structure between genes. Results: In gsn ca weight factors are assigned to genes in proportion to the genes cross correlations inter gene correlations). The problem of finding the weight vectors is formulated as an eigenvector problem with a unique solution. gsn ca tests the null hypothesis that for a gene set there is no difference in the weight vectors of the genes between two conditions. In simulation studies and the analyses of experimental data, we demonstrate that gsn ca captures changes in the structure of genes cross correlations rather than differences in the averaged pairwise correlations. Thus, gsn ca infers differences in coexpression networks, however, bypassing method dependent steps of network inference. As an additional result from gsn ca we define hub genes as genes with the largest weights and show that these genes correspond frequently to major and specific pathway regulators, as well as to genes that are most affected by the biological difference between two conditions. In summary, gsn ca is a new approach for the analysis of differentially coexpressed pathways that also evaluates the importance of the genes in the pathways, thus providing unique information that may result in the generation of novel biological hypotheses.

introduction large scale biological research, including genetic linkage association studies, copy number variation, microarray and rnase q expression experiments, typically compare two or more different phenotypes to infer a unique genetic background, associated with a particular phenotype. A decade ago, the methods for such analyses were dominated by univariate two sample statistical tests, which frequently fell short from a statistical and a biological perspective because of two reasons. First, small changes in expression can not be captured for a single gene using two sample tests (e.g. t statistic with the correction for multiple testing (). Second, genes do not work in isolation but interact with each other collectively; as a consequence, statistical tests need to account for a multivariate nature of expression changes (Emmert). These shortcomings catalyzed the appearance of conceptually new methodologies for the analysis of genomic data. Instead of considering a single gene as an expression unit, new methodologies started to operate with gene sets (corresponding, e.g. to biological pathways), considering a gene set as the unit of expression. The first test of this kind was the gene set enrichment analysis (). To date many methodologies for testing the differential expression of gene sets (molecular pathways, biological processes) have been suggested and are collectively named gene set analysis (GSA) approaches (). GSA approaches can be either competitive or self contained. Competitive approaches compare a gene set against its complement that contains all genes except genes in the set, and self contained approaches compare whether a gene set is differentially expressed between two phenotypes (). Unfortunately, some competitive GSA approaches are influenced by the genomic coverage and the filtering of the data and can increase their power by the addition of unrelated data and even noise (). Owing to these problems, we focus in this article on self contained methods only. self contained approaches, depending on the statistics used for the testing, test different null hypotheses (Emmert). The possibility to formulate different statistical hypotheses enables the formulation and exploration of different biological hypotheses. However, for GSA approaches, testing hypotheses other than the equality of the mean expression vectors remains under explored. We recently suggested to extend a univariate analysis of differential gene variability () to a multivariate case of gene sets () with a multivariate non-parametric 'radial' kolmogorov smirnov test, sensitive to alternatives that *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

We found that for several tumor types, the pathways, detected exclusively by the radial kolmogorov smirnov test, were mostly tumor specific whereas the pathways with differences in the mean expression vectors were detected simultaneously in different tumor types (). The main focus of this article is to develop a novel multivariate differential coexpression analysis approach for gene sets. The first approach for testing the differential coexpression of gene pairs, tested the equality of pairwise correlations to identify gene pairs with correlated expression patterns in one phenotype but not the other (). Its extension to the general multivariate case, involving gene sets with 42 genes, depends on the biological context. When there are no a priori defined gene sets available, the simplest way of differential coexpression analysis, implemented in the R package cox press is to find clusters of coexpressed genes in one condition and check whether these clusters show no correlation in another condition (). Another approach, e.g. implemented in the R package diff coex constructs adjacency matrices of all genes under different conditions, transforms adjacency matrices into a matrix of adjacency differences and uses a topological overlap measure to infer clusters of differentially coexpressed genes (). When there are a priori defined gene sets available, the differential coexpression of gene sets can be found by using the gene sets coexpression analysis gsc a (). In this approach, the Euclidian distance between two correlation vectors (constructed from diagonal matrices of pairwise correlations for different conditions) is calculated and the significance of the difference is estimated using permutation test. The differentially coexpressed gene sets d coxs method is similar to gsc a in its overall strategy. First, the gene's pairwise co expressions are characterized separately for two conditions, and second, the similarities of these characteristics are estimated (). The d coxs uses relative entropy matrices in place of correlation matrices, as used by gsc a and the correlation coefficient between the upper diagonal elements of these matrices as a measure of their similarity. The new property of d coxs is that the coexpression of two different pathways can also be estimated (). There are also other approaches for the differential coexpression analysis of gene sets (); the common aspect of all these approaches is that they account for changes in aggregate measures of pairwise correlations only. In this article, we present a novel approach that assesses multivariate changes in the gene coexpression network between two conditions. Importantly, we do not infer 'gene coexpression networks' explicitly, but, instead, we estimate net correlation changes by introducing for each gene a weight factor that characterizes its cross correlations in the coexpression networks. Weight vectors in both conditions are found as eigenvectors of correlation matrices with zero diagonal elements. The Gene Sets Net Correlations Analysis gsn ca tests the hypothesis that for a gene set there is no difference in the gene weight vectors between two conditions. Furthermore, we suggest a new graphical visualization to present the full coexpression network that highlights the most highly correlated genes, using the union of the first and second minimum spanning trees (MST2). We show that genes in the center of MST2 have large weights, and we demonstrate that hub genes genes with the largest weight in the pathways correspond in real data frequently to pathway regulators. In previous studies, MST was mainly used for cluster analysis in gene expression studies. For instance suggested gene expression data clustering based on MST, which rigorously converts a multidimensional clustering problem to a tree partitioning problem. prom presented a method to improve the biological relevance in the inference of functional modules from the gene expression data by enhancing the structure of a weighted gene coexpression network using MST. However, to our knowledge, no attempt has been made so far to present the full coexpression network that highlights the most highly correlated genes via MST2 structure. We choose to compare gsn ca with the gsc a (), as the idea behind gsc a comparing pairwise measures of the genes coexpression between two conditions is frequently used in other approaches (e.g. d coxs. The conceptual differences between our approach and gsc a are illustrated in simulations as well as in the application to two gene expression data sets.

Motivation: The Ensembl Project provides release specific Perl APIs for efficient high level programmatic access to data stored in various Ensembl database schema. Although Perl scripts are perfectly suited for processing large volumes of text based data, Perl is not ideal for developing large scale software applications nor embedding in graph-ical interfaces. The provision of a novel Java API would facilitate type-safe, modular, object orientated development of new Bioinfor-matics tools with which to access, analyse and visualize Ensembl data. Results: The j ensembl API implementation provides basic data retrieval and manipulation functionality from the Core, Compara and Variation databases for all species in Ensembl and ensembl genomes and is a platform for the development of a richer API to Ensembl data sources. The j ensembl architecture uses a text based configuration module to provide evolving, versioned mappings from database schema to code objects. A single installation of the j ensembl API can therefore simultaneously and transparently connect to current and previous database instances (such as those in the public archive) thus facilitating better analysis repeatability and allowing through time comparative analyses to be performed. Availability: Project development, released code libraries, Maven repository and documentation are hosted at SourceForge

introduction the Ensembl Project provides a genome information system for the annotation, analysis and display of genome assembly data pertaining to vertebrates [ENSEMBL (http://www.ensembl.org)] and for other taxonomic groups ensembl genomes (http://www.ensemblgenomes.org)]. Together with core genomic annotations, the curated resources now include comparative genomic, variation, functional genomic and regulatory data stored in separate but linked database schemas (). Access to data in Ensembl databases is freely provided through ensembl s interactive web browser, the bio mart data mining tool (http://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview) and web services (http://www.biomart.org/martservice.html), publicly exposed MySQL databases ensembl dbensemblorg5306 mysql ebiacuk4157 ensembl dbensemblorg3306 and programmatically through Perl API modules (http://www.ensembl org info data api html (). The Perl API is ideally suited to the processing of large volumes of text based data and as such is used for the majority of the Ensembl systems' internal workflows. However, Perl is not an ideal language for embedding in graphical interfaces. In contrast, Java provides a robust, object oriented programming environment and is a preferable language for implementing large scale projects, with the benefits of compile time type checking, enforced interfaces, the potential to separate interface from implementation (allowing for transparent alternative implementations), multi-threading, better support for graphical user interfaces and support for garbage collection of circularly referenced objects. Java, like Perl, also benefits from a vast resource of freely available diverse code libraries and development frameworks and tools, including open source projects in the Bioinformatics domain. Previously, Ensembl provided the en sj library, a Java API for data access in Java or Jython (). Like the Perl API, en sj intimately embedded data access code (i.e. the actual SQL statements that access the Ensembl MySQL databases) within the body of code representing the genetic objects. As a consequence, a new API release had to be generated for each database schema version (Ensembl release) configured to connect and retrieve data from its cognate schema, with no backwards compatibility guaranteed. As with the Perl API, the dispersed nature of the embedded SQL statements meant that changes required to keep pace with each database release were spread across multiple files, which was an inefficient process. In 2006, en sj was discontinued when the Ensembl team elected to focus their finite resources on the maintenance of the Perl API code alone. Since then, despite the growing number of bioinformatic tools being developed in Java, there has been no Java Ensembl API available. Other parties have, however, developed several partial APIs to Ensembl in a number of alternative programming languages, particularly to support bulk data download. Typically, these APIs do not directly address the issue of schema versioning, and many are not actively maintained. Two of the most widely used such APIs are the Bioconductor R interface to bio mart bio mart (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/ html bio mart html although this is a bio mart API rather than an Ensembl API per se, and the bio gem plug-in ruby ensembl api (http://bioruby-annex.rubyforge.org/) which uses Active Records to abstract over the Ensembl Core Schema. *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

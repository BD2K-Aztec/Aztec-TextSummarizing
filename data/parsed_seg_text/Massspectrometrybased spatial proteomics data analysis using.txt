Motivation: Experimental spatial proteomics, i.e. the high throughput assignment of proteins to sub-cellular compartments based on quantitative proteomics data, promises to shed new light on many biological processes given adequate computational tools. Results: Here we present pro loc a complete infrastructure to support and guide the sound analysis of quantitative mass spectrometry based spatial proteomics data. It provides functionality for unsupervised and supervised machine learning for data exploration and protein classification and novelty detection to identify new puta-tive sub-cellular clusters. The software builds upon existing infrastructure for data management and data processing. Availability: pro loc is implemented in the R language and available under an open source license from the Bioconductor project (http:// www bioconductor org.

introduction knowledge of the spatial distribution of proteins is of critical importance to elucidate their role and refine our understanding of cellular processes. mis localization of proteins have been associated with cellular dysfunction and disease states (), highlighting the importance of localization studies. Spatial or organelle proteomics is the systematic study of the proteins and their subcellular localization; these compartments can be organelles, i.e. structures defined by lipid bi-layers, macro-molecular assemblies of proteins and nucleic acids or large protein complexes. Despite technological advances in spatial proteomics experimental designs and progress in mass spectrometry (), software support is lacking. To address this, we developed the pro loc package that provides a wide range of thoroughly documented analysis methodologies. The software includes state of the art statistical machine learning algorithms and bundles them in a consistent framework, accommodating any experimental designs and quantitation strategies.

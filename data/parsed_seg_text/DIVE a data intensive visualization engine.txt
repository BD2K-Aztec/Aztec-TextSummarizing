Modern scientific investigation is generating increasingly larger datasets, yet analyzing these data with current tools is challenging. DIVE is a software framework intended to facilitate big data analysis and reduce the time to scientific insight. Here, we present features of the framework and demonstrate DIVEs application to the dy name omics project, looking specifically at two proteins. Availability and implementation: Binaries and documentation are available at http://www.dynameomics.org/DIVE/DIVESetup.exe.

introduction the advent of massive networked computing resources has enabled virtually unlimited data collection, storage and analysis from low cost genome sequencing, high precision molecular dynamics simulations and high definition imaging data for radiology, to name just a few examples. This explosion of 'big data' is changing traditional scientific methods; instead of relying on experiments to output relatively small targeted datasets, data mining techniques are being used to analyze data stores with the intent of learning from the data patterns themselves. Unfortunately, data analysis and integration in large data storage environments is challenging even for experienced scientists. Furthermore, most existing domain specific tools designed for complex heterogeneous datasets are not equipped to visually analyze big data. DIVE is a software framework designed for exploring large, heterogeneous, high dimensional datasets using a visual analytics approach (Supplementary). Visual analytics is a big data exploration methodology emphasizing the iterative process between human intuition, computational analyses and visualization. DIVE's visual analytics approach integrates with traditional methods, creating an environment that supports data exploration and discovery.

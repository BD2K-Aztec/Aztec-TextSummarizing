The application of docking to large scale experiments or the explicit treatment of protein flexibility are part of the new challenges in structural bioinformatics that will require large computer resources and more efficient algorithms. Highly optimized fast Fourier transform (FFT) approaches are broadly used in docking programs but their optimal code implementation leaves hardware acceleration as the only option to significantly reduce the computational cost of these tools. In this work we present cell dock an fft based docking algorithm adapted to the Cell BE processor. We show that cell dock runs faster than ft dock with maximum speedups of above 200Ã‚, while achieving results of similar quality.

introduction cell functions rely on intricate networks of protein protein interactions, which need to be understood at structural and functional level. Given the magnitude of the human interactome, experimental efforts will have to be complemented by computational approaches such as protein protein docking, which aims to predict the structure of complexes from the free unbound subunits (). Fast Fourier transform fft based docking approaches revolutionized the field (), but faster computer solutions are required in order to face some of the current docking challenges, some of which have arisen from the recent Critical Assessment of Prediction of Interactions (CAPRI) experiments (), such as protein flexibility (), large scale experiments () or multi-protein docking (). Given that FFT implementations are highly optimized, it is not likely to speed up this type of calculations by using only algorithm optimization techniques, leaving hardware acceleration as the most feasible option to significantly reduce the computational cost of these tools (;). In this work we present cell dock to our knowledge the first protein docking algorithm implemented on the Cell BE processor ().

conclusion cell dock is a new fft based docking implementation for the Cell BE architecture, showing similar prediction rates to ft dock with much more efficient performance. This implementation can efficiently run on the widely accessible PlayStation 3, opening the door to large scale experiments that may benefit

Motivation: ago argonaut e binding domains, composed of repeated motifs, in which only binary combinations of tryptophan and glycine are conserved, bind AGO proteins and are essential during rnai mediated gene silencing. The amino acid sequence of this domain is extremely divergent and therefore very difficult to detect. Commonly used bioinformatic tools fail to identify tryptophan glycine and or glycine tryptophan motifs wg gw domains and currently there is no publicly available software which can detect these weakly conserved, but functional ago binding segments. Results: Recently, we have developed an algorithm based on compositional analysis of the amino acid content of the domain. We have demonstrated that the algorithm can be successfully applied for the identification of the new wg gw proteins in the Arabidopsis genome. Here we introduce Agos argonaut e binding domain screener), a novel universal web service for de novo identification of wg gw domains in protein sequences. The web implementation of the algorithm contains several new features and enhancements: (i) one universal scoring matrix which allows identification of ago binding proteins in sequences representing all organisms; (ii) reduction of false positive predictions by improved selectivity of the algorithm; (iii) graphical interface to easily browse the prediction results; and (iv) the option to submit a DNA sequence which will be automatically translated in six frames before running the prediction algorithm.

introduction the wg gw domains recruit argonaut e (AGO) proteins to distinct components of the eukaryotic RNA silencing pathways and are strictly required for gene silencing by RNA interference (RNAi). The sequences of the domain are extremely divergent and are composed of quasi repeated regions containing conserved tryptophan glycine and or glycine tryptophan motifs (henceforth called wg gw motifs), which are essential for binding multiple molecules of AGO proteins ().

Motivation: pseudo knots found in secondary structures of a number of functional RNAs play various roles in biological processes. Recent methods for predicting RNA secondary structures cover certain classes of pseudo knotted structures, but only a few of them achieve satisfying predictions in terms of both speed and accuracy. Results: We propose ip knot a novel computational method for predicting RNA secondary structures with pseudo knots based on maximizing expected accuracy of a predicted structure. ip knot decomposes a pseudo knotted structure into a set of pseudoknot free substructures and approximates a base pairing probability distribution that considers pseudo knots leading to the capability of modeling a wide class of pseudo knots and running quite fast. In addition, we propose a heuristic algorithm for refining base paring probabilities to improve the prediction accuracy of ip knot. The problem of maximizing expected accuracy is solved by using integer programming with threshold cut. We also extend ip knot so that it can predict the consensus secondary structure with pseudo knots when a multiple sequence alignment is given. ip knot is validated through extensive experiments on various datasets, showing that ip knot achieves better prediction accuracy and faster running time as compared with several competitive prediction methods.

introduction rnas play various roles in biological processes, ranging from the passive role as a messenger that carries genetic information to the active roles as a regulator for gene expression and as a catalyst in cellular processes. Considerable attention has been paid to the functions of RNAs, especially those of regulatory non-coding RNAs (). It is widely believed that there is a strong correlation between the 3D structure of an RNA molecule and its function. A set of base pairs formed from hydrogen bonds is called a secondary structure, which shapes the substructure of the 3D structure. Since experimental determination of RNA 3D structures is difficult and their structures are hierarchical, secondary structure prediction provides a major key to elucidating the potential functions of RNAs. A good number of computational studies have so far been presented on RNA secondary structure prediction. They can be roughly classified into two groups, namely comparative sequence analysis and single sequence analysis. Comparative methods based on alignment folding include rna ali fold () and p fold (). The comparative analysis has an advantage of a fair possibility of achieving high prediction accuracy since it can take evolutionary information into consideration. However, this approach is not always applicable since a set of homologous sequences is required in advance. As for single sequence analysis, a popular approach is to find the structure with the minimum free energy (MFE) of a single RNA sequence. We can use programs that implement this strategy based on dynamic programming (DP) algorithms such as m fold () and rna fold (). Notice that the free energy of a secondary structure is calculated by summing energy parameters of respective loop substructures, which can be experimentally determined and computationally estimated (). Furthermore, these dp based methods are applied to the calculation of the partition function for RNA secondary structures (), which enables us to compute posterior base pairing probabilities. Recently, several sophisticated methods have been proposed for predicting the secondary structure with the maximum expected accuracy me a over a space of possible structures. contra fold () and centroid fold () that adopt this idea achieve better prediction accuracy as compared with the mfe based methods. It is to be noted that all of the above methods aim to predict relatively simple RNA structures with nested base pairing interactions. Pseudoknot is one of the important topologies in RNA secondary structures. A pseudoknot is typically formed from the base pairings between the unpaired bases of a loop and those outside the loop, which is often called an h type pseudoknot (see). In other words, a secondary structure includes a pseudoknot if at least two arcs drawn above the primary sequence that represent base pairs cross each other (see). pseudo knotted structures are observed in many RNAs such as ribosomal RNAs, transfer messenger RNAs and viral RNAs (van). pseudo knots are known

conclusion we proposed a new computational method ip knot for predicting RNA secondary structures with a wide class of pseudo knots which can take either a single sequence or aligned sequences as input. We demonstrated using a variety of structural datasets that ip knot is sufficiently fast and accurate as a computational prediction tool for both single sequence analysis and comparative sequence analysis. Prediction accuracy of ip knot depends mainly on its scoring functions even though the method uses the approximate probability distribution for pseudo knotted structures. In fact, experimental results revealed that ip knot with the base pairing probabilities computed by heuristic refinement produces much better predictions than that without refinement. Moreover, when we adopted the exact probabilities for pseudo knots a significant improvement in accuracy was confirmed, though much computation time was spent on the predictions. Considering these results, there is room for further investigation into refinement of the scoring functions that make prediction accuracy compatible with running time. Another important fact to stress is that ip knot can run quite fast even on a relatively long sequence less than one thousand bases. This is attributed to use of both approximation of a probability distribution for pseudo knots and integer programming with threshold cut based on maximizing expected accuracy. As described in Section 1, prediction methods with satisfying speed and accuracy are useful for finding functional non-coding RNA genes from genome sequences. Making skillful use of the speed and accuracy of our method, exhaustive search for genes of non-coding RNAs that may form pseudo knots is a worthwhile task as another future work.

Motivation: Researchers worldwide have generated a huge volume of genomic data, including thousands of genome wide association studies g was and massive amounts of gene expression data from different tissues. How to perform a joint analysis of these data to gain new biological insights has become a critical step in understanding the etiology of complex diseases. Due to the polygenic architecture of complex diseases, the identification of risk genes remains challenging. Motivated by the shared risk genes found in complex diseases and tissue specific gene expression patterns, we propose as an Empirical Bayes approach to integrating ple io tropy and tissue specific information (EPS) for prioritizing risk genes. Results: As demonstrated by extensive simulation studies, EPS greatly improves the power of identification for disease risk genes. EPS enables rigorous hypothesis testing of ple io tropy and tissue specific risk gene expression patterns. All of the model parameters can be adaptively estimated from the developed expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. We applied EPS to the bipo-lar disorder and schizophrenia g was from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, along with the gene expression data for multiple tissues from the genotype tissue Expression project. The results of the real data analysis demonstrate many advantages of EPS. Availability and implementation: The EPS software is available on https://sites.google.com/site/

introduction as of April 2015, genome wide association studies g was have identified more than 15 000 disease associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at a genome wide significance level (i.e. p value  5  10 8 ). Despite these discoveries, these SNPs can only explain a small fraction of the genetic contribution to diseases (). It is widely agreed that this phenomenon is due to polygenic ity of complex phenotypes and the large number of risk variants with weak effects that remain undiscovered (). Growing evidence suggests that there are many genetic variants that may affect the multiple, seemingly different phenotypes (traits/ diseases) (). In fact, a term named ple io tropy was introduced to describe such a phenomenon more than 100 years ago (). The original definition of ple io tropy only V C The Author 2016.

For example, the G allele of rs6983267 increases the risk for prostate cancer and colorectal cancer () but the G allele of rs12720356 increases the risk for Crohn's disease and decreases the risk for psoriasis (). A closely related but different concept is 'genetic correlation' (also known as co heritability cross disorder Group of the Psychiatric). This refers to the correlation between the genetic effect sizes of two phenotypes and thus the direction of these effects plays a role. To be clear, when referring to ple io tropy in this article, we adopt its original definition. We are interested in the substantial overlap of genetic factors that underlie the multiple, seemingly different phenotypes. Fortunately, more g was results are becoming publicly available from g was repositories, such as the g was grasp (). This offers us an unprecedented opportunity to explore pleiotropic effects. Besides an enormous amount of g was data, diverse data resources for biological processes at different layers are also becoming available (). For example, the ongoing genotype tissue Expression project g tex is generating a comprehensive atlas of gene expression and regulation across multiple human tissues (). This provides abundant information to quantify biological processes that occur at the cellular level and thereby helps us to dissect the etiology of complex diseases. Moreover, the comprehensive gene expression data in multiple tissues may avoid the potential bias of the 'candidate tissue approach'. For example, in the study of obesity, the affected tissue is fat, but the causal tissue is, in some cases, the hypothalamus (). This suggests that the integration of g was data and gene expressions from multiple tissues may advance our understanding of complex diseases. At present, the accumulating evidence on ple io tropy () and vast, publicly available data on tissue specific gene expression [e.g. TiGER () and g tex (require novel statistical approaches to gain a deeper understanding of complex diseases (). Statistical approaches that take ple io tropy into consideration have recently become very active (), such as the conditional false discovery rate (FDR) approach (), and linear mixed model based approaches (). Various statistical methods have also been proposed to analyze tissue specific gene expression data (), such as joint e qtl analysis in multiple tissues () and covariate modulated FDR cmf dr (). More recently, a statistical approach named 'GPA' () was proposed to simultaneously integrate both pleiotropic information and functional annotation. Although GPA has demonstrated a very promising direction for the integration of multiple sources of genomic information, it does not fully account for the effects of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and only allows binary annotation as its input. These disadvantages may limit its use in the integrative analysis of large scale genomic data. In this article, we propose an Empirical Bayes approach to integrating ple io tropy and tissue specific (EPS) information for prioritizing risk genes. Compared with some existing approaches (), EPS has several merits. First, EPS only requires the summary statistics at the gene level, rather than the genotype data at the individual level. The LD effects are carefully accounted for when grouping the snp level summary statistics into the gene level summary statistics by using reference panel data (e.g. 1000 genome data). Second, EPS is able to integrate both ple io tropy information and gene expression data (e.g. g tex data), which greatly improves the power of risk gene prioritization. Third, EPS provides rigorous hypothesis testing to evaluate the significance of ple io tropy and tissue specific patterns. These merits are demonstrated via extensive simulation studies and real data analysis.

conclusion we have presented a statistical approach, named EPS, that can integrate ple io tropy information from g was data and tissue specific gene expression data. Compared with some existing approaches, such as linear mixed models, which require genotype data at the individual level, EPS only requires summary statistics for analysis. More importantly, EPS provides statistically rigorous evaluations of tissue specific gene expression patterns and pleiotropic effects via hypothesis testing. These merits make EPS an attractive and effective tool for the integrative analysis of g was data with gene expression data from multiple tissues. Despite the promising statistical improvements we have made, the biological implications need to be independently replicated. One limitation of EPS is that it does not take into account overlapping samples. Addressing this issue in integrating multiple g was is an important area for future work.

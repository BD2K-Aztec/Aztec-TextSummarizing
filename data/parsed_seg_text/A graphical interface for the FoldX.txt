A graphical user interface for the fold x protein design program has been developed as a plugin for the yasar a molecular graphics suite. The most prominent fold x commands such as free energy difference upon mutagenesis and interaction energy calculations can now be run entirely via a windowed menu system and the results are immediately shown on screen. Availability and Implementation: The plugin is written in Python and is freely available for download at http://foldxyasara.switchlab.org/ and supported on Linux, MacOSX and MS Windows.

introduction the empirical force field fold x () was developed for the rapid evaluation of the effect of mutations on the stability, folding and dynamics of proteins and nucleic acids (). fold x is normally run from the command line with user provided configuration files. To increase the usability, many core functionalities of fold x have now become available through a complete graphics interface as a plugin for the yasar a () molecular viewer.

Biological trace elements are required for numerous biological processes and by all organisms. We describe a database, dbt eu (DataBase of Trace Element Utilization), that features known transporters and user proteins for five trace elements (copper, molybdenum, nickel, cobalt and selenium) and represents sequenced organisms from the three domains of life. The manually curated dbt eu currently includes âˆ¼16 500 proteins from 700 organisms, and offers interactive trace element, protein, organism and sequence search and browse tools. Availability and Implementation: dbt eu is freely available at

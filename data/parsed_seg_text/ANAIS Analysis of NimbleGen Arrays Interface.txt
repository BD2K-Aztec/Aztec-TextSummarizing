ANAIS is a user friendly web based tool for the processing of nimble gen expression data. The interface reads single channel microarray files generated by nimble gen platforms and produces easily interpretable graphical and numerical results. It provides biologists six turnkey analysis modules normalization probe to gene, quality controls, differential expression, detection, queries and clustering to explore quickly, freely and without the need for computer programming, nimble gen transcriptome data.

introduction microarray technologies have become widely used in genome wide gene expression studies. The nimble gen platform (http://www nimble gen com that offers customized high density arrays with multiple long oligos per gene, is particularly gaining popularity among biologists. Nevertheless, few complete, ready mixed and free analysis tools are available (). Here, we report an intuitive web interface that allows scientists to conduct themselves all the analysis steps needed to interpret a nimble gen expression experiment. In addition to the conventional processes, such as normalization and differential expression, the tool also offers interesting modules performing quality controls, detection and queries. Moreover, the toolset was developed with a sake of rapidity compatible with a remote use via Internet, and accepts all one colour nimble gen expression array designs.

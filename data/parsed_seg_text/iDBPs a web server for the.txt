The id bps server uses the three dimensional (3D) structure of a query protein to predict whether it binds DNA. First, the algorithm predicts the functional region of the protein based on its evolutionary profile; the assumption is that large clusters of conserved residues are good markers of functional regions. Next, various characteristics of the predicted functional region as well as global features of the protein are calculated, such as the average surface electrostatic potential, the dipole moment and cluster based amino acid conservation patterns. Finally, a random forests classifier is used to predict whether the query protein is likely to bind DNA and to estimate the prediction confidence. We have trained and tested the classifier on various datasets and shown that it outperformed related methods. On a dataset that reflects the fraction of DNA binding proteins (DBPs) in a proteome, the area under the ROC curve was 0.90. The application of the server to an updated version of the n func database, which contains proteins of unknown function with solved 3d structure suggested new putative DBPs for experimental studies.

introduction dna binding proteins (DBPs) compose a considerable part of the proteomes of the various organisms (), and take part in various processes, such as DNA transcription, replication and packing. There are a number of approaches for the identification of DBPs. Some methods look for direct similarity between the query protein and DBPs (e.g.). When the DNA binding domain is novel, methods that do not rely directly on previous data may be advantageous. Such methods often rely on electrostatic features of the proteins. DNA is negatively charged, and the DNA binding region of the protein is often positively charged. Therefore, features of positively charged patches on the proteins' surfaces have been examined in order to identify DBPs (). * To whom correspondence should be addressed other features that represent the distribution of charges within the protein structure have also been used (;), as well as secondary structure content () and the amino acid composition (). We recently developed a method for the prediction of DBPs based on the identification of the functional region within the query protein (). We showed that patches of highly conserved amino acids, detected by patch finder (), often delineate the functional regions in proteins in general, and the core of DNA binding regions within DBPs in particular (). Using features of the predicted functional regions and additional global features, we trained a random forests classifier () on a dataset of 138 DBPs and 110 proteins that do not bind DNA (). We examined the classifier on a realistic dataset that reflects the fraction of DBPs in proteomes. We evaluated this fraction to be 14% and extended the original dataset by 733 additional proteins that do not bind DNA. The sensitivity and the precision on this dataset were 0.90 and 0.35, respectively, with the default prediction score cut off. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.90. We also showed that the performance of the classifier was superior to related methods (). Here, we present the id bps web server, which implements the classifier. The server is freely available at http://idbps.tau.ac.il/. It is easy to use and only requires the PDB file (or PDB id) and the chain identifier of the protein of interest.

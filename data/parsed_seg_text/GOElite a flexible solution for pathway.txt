We introduce go elite a flexible and powerful pathway analysis tool for a wide array of species, identifiers (IDs), pathways, ontologies and gene sets. In addition to the Gene Ontology (GO), go elite allows the user to perform over-representation analysis on any structured ontology annotations, pathway database or biological IDs (e.g. gene, protein or metabolite). go elite exploits the structured nature of biological ontologies to report a minimal set of non-overlapping terms. The results can be visualized on wiki pathways or as networks. built in support is provided for over 60 species and 50 ID systems, covering gene, disease and phenotype ontologies, multiple pathway databases, biomarkers, and transcription factor and microRNA targets. go elite is available as a web interface, gen map pcs plugin and as a cross platform application.

introduction the analysis of pathways, ontologies and other gene sets has become the preferred method for biologists looking to identify global trends from genomic datasets. Although a myriad of tools exist for pathway over-representation, few consider the structured nature of associated ontology data, alternative ontologies and diverse gene sets; few support a wide array of genomes or biological measurements, and they are often limited in scope (). Unlike ontologies, pathways provide valuable qualitative contexts (interactions, reactions, metabolites and cellular compartments) that highlight biological relevance. Although various pathway resources now exist (), most over-representation analysis or a tools are limited to one resource that is often outdated. To address these deficiencies, go elite was developed to provide an interchangeable and updatable model of pathway, ontology, species and gene ID system relationships. Using these relationships,

introduction high throughput technologies and integrative systems biology have led to an increasing need for high performance computing. Cloud computing has emerged as an attractive solution to issues of maintenance, administration and obsolescence (). The Bioconductor bioconductor org and R cran r project org projects offer a rich, open source computational environment with over 3000 'packages' high level libraries) covering data analysis (e.g. sequencing, chip rnase q simulation modeling (e.g. stochastic modeling, ODEs and PDEs) and network integration, analysis and visualization. Compatibility with other resources is provided via bridging packages such as r sbml and r graphviz

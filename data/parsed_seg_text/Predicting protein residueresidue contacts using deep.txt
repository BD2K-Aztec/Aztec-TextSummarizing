Motivation: Protein residue residue contacts continue to play a larger and larger role in protein tertiary structure modeling and evaluation. Yet, while the importance of contact information increases, the performance of sequence based contact predictors has improved slowly. New approaches and methods are needed to spur further development and progress in the field.

introduction the prediction of protein residue residue contacts is seen by many as an important intermediate step for gaining traction on the challenging task of tertiary structure prediction. This idea has been spurred further recently by encouraging results that demonstrate that predicted contact information can indeed be used to improve tertiary structure prediction and effectively transform some unfolded structures into their folded counterpart (). The addition of a contact guided structure modeling category in the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) on a rolling basis has also aided in sparking interesting in residue residue contact prediction. Beyond the scope of tertiary structure prediction, protein residue residue contacts have been used in drug design (), model evaluation () and model ranking and selection (). Existing methods for residue residue contact prediction can be broadly categorized as sequence based or template structure based. sequence based methods attempt to predict contacts from the primary sequence or information that can be derived directly from the sequence. A number of these sequence based methods use various machine learning methods such as support vector machines (), neural networks (), hidden Markov models (), Markov logic networks (), random forests () and deep architectures () to make residue residue contact predictions. Other sequence based approaches have used evolutionary information contained in multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) to identify possible contacts (). Methods using MSAs were among the first sequence based approaches tried but suffered from low accuracies caused by indirect or transitive correlations. More recent developments by using large MSAs and sparse covariance matrices have been better able to identify contacting residues from the alignments and resulted in significant improvements in accuracy. template structure based methods operate by extracting contact information from structural data. For template based methods, this structural data comes in the form of templates (i.e. homologous proteins with known structure). Once templates have been found and aligned, residue residue contacts are predicted using the contacts found in the structures (). Given the relatively high quality of the tertiary structure models generated by template based techniques, residue residue contact data is most useful when dealing with hard targets (i.e. those for which a structural template does not exists or hard to identify by sequence alone). For hard targets, the conformational search is much larger and overall model quality is usually much lower. Thus, there is great interest in high quality sequence based residue residue contact predictors that do not rely on template data. Such contact predictors would be able to provide additional information when generating models for hard targets. Unfortunately, recent assessments of state of the art sequence based contact predictors routinely report average accuracies in the 2030% range, indicating a need for further development and new methods and ideas (). Here we present a new sequence based residue residue contact predictor using deep networks (DNs) and boosting. Our method differs from other implementations of deep architectures owing to its boosted nature, overall network architecture and training procedure. More specifically, for training, we initially use an unsupervised approach to learn patterns in the data and initialize *To whom correspondence should be addressed. parameters and then fine tune them with back propagation. Furthermore, by using the computational power of graphical processing units (GPUs) and CUDA, we were able to train large boosted ensembles of DN classifiers achieving state of the art performance.

conclusion in this work, we have presented dnc on a new method for protein residue residue prediction. The approach is based on two concepts, boosted ensembles and DNs, which are novel in.

When compared with the current state of the art dnc on performs favorably, achieving state of the art performance in the critical area of accuracy on top medium and long range contact predictions. When allowing for less than residue level precision, the performance of dnc on is even more impressive. Given the strong contact signal present for short and medium range contacts and the fast flexible architecture of DNs, in the future, we plan on modifying the DNs such that they can incorporate and propagate predicted short to medium range contacts when making longer range predictions. We also plan on refining the parameters and network architecture used to increase performance. The method is available as a web service at http://iris.rnet.missouri.edu/ dnc on

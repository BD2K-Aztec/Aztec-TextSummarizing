Motivation: Bioimaging techniques rapidly develop toward higher resolution and dimension. The increase in dimension is achieved by different techniques such as multi tag fluorescence imaging, Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption / Ionization (MALDI) imaging or Raman imaging, which record for each pixel an n dimensional intensity array, representing local abundances of molecules, residues or interaction patterns. The analysis of such multivariate bioimages mb is calls for new approaches to support users in the analysis of both feature domains: space (i.e. sample morphology) and molecular colocation or interaction. In this article, we present our approach w hide web based Hyperbolic Image Data Explorer) that combines principles from computational learning, dimension reduction and visualization in a free web application. Results: We applied w hide to a set of MBI recorded using the multi tag fluorescence imaging topo nome Imaging System. The MBI show field of view in tissue sections from a colon cancer study and we compare tissue from normal healthy colon with tissue classified as tumor. Our results show, that w hide efficiently reduces the complexity of the data by mapping each of the pixels to a cluster, referred to as Molecular Co-Expression Phenotypes and provides a structural basis for a sophisticated multimodal visualization, which combines topology preserving pseudo coloring with information visualization. The wide range of w hides applicability is demonstrated with examples from topo nome imaging, high content screens and MALDI imaging (shown in the Supplementary Material). Availability and implementation: The w hide tool can be accessed via the bio imax website

introduction bio image informatics has been established as a new branch in the tree of bioinformatics' fields of research in the last 10 years. The term bio image comprises all kinds of images generated for * To whom correspondence should be addressed. biological samples in a biological or biomedical research context using a large diversity of imaging techniques. The techniques range from standard ones such as bright field imaging or phase contrast to advanced technologies that enable recording many molecular variables for each resolvable volume unit. The latter group of technologies can also be referred to as multivariate bioimages (). MBI belong to the so called high content imaging techniques which apply high resolution imaging in time and or space and or variables to close those open gaps in systems biology which can not be bridged by standard, i.e. non spatial omics techniques (). While these can in principle resolve the almost complete molecular composition in a sample on different levels (genomics, trans cip to mics proteomics and metabolomics) they have to leave out the spatial domain. In contrast to that, bioimaging approaches, which usually work with a lower level of molecular resolution, can relate molecular information to spatial features such as morphology. Typical examples for MBI are Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption / Ionization (MALDI) imaging (), vibrational spectroscopy raman microscopy (van) or multi epitope ligand Cartography me lc topo nome Imaging System (TIS) (). The first two techniques measure molecular features and interactions in localized spectra, arranged in a pixel grid. The interpretation of the obtained images aims at the identification of pixel groups that share particular or similar spectral features (e.g.) where as the final identification of molecules and a semantic interpretation remains an unsolved problems for most applications. In contrast to that, mel ct is (for the sake of compactness we will refer to this technique with TIS) imaging aims at the imaging of a selected set of N proteins using a library of N fluorescent labeled antibodies, lectins or other specific ligands (referred to as tags, in general) in combination with a cyclic protocol of staining, fluorescence imaging and soft bleaching. To unfold the full potential of all these kinds of MBI, new algorithms and software are needed that allow researchers to visually explore the data and to identify the hidden regularities. In this article, we will focus on images recorded using the TIS technology, however our method is definitely applicable to other MBI data recorded with a different multi tag technology or MALDI images as well. For one selected field of view (FOV) in the sample, TIS records one multivariate image T (s) which consists of a set of N aligned images g,...,N (with x,y as pixel coordinates) with s (s = 1,...,S) describing the ID of the TIS image fov and g The Author(s) 2012.

discussion the w hide tool shows significant advantages compared with other approaches to MBI analysis. First, it is able to resolve and embed non-linear data structures. This can be seen by browsing the cipr as on the H 2 SOM visualization on the color disc. Moving the cursor slowly across the discs shows the cipr as of neighboring clusters. The cipr as show, that similarity in cluster prototypes is reflected by vicinity in the H 2 SOM grid, i.e. the n dimensional data topology is preserved regarding local neighborhoods. A second striking feature is the H 2 SOM visualization using the mbi us transform which allows change of zoom in the n dimensional feature space by mapping a smaller number of neighboring clusters to a larger area in the color scale. This way, particular groups of mc eps can be pseudo colored in higher color resolution whereas the rest of the TIS image is colored with a very small part of the color scale, i.e. with low contrast. Another positive feature of the w hide approach is the reduction of the TIS data using vector quantization as performed by the H 2 SOM algorithm which has shown to resolve even small clusters and organize the clusters in a hierarchical structure. If the cipr a visualization is compared with two classic methods such as bar graphs and star glyphs, it is evident that in the cipr a
conclusion due to advances in machine learning research, present day internet connection bandwidths and state of the art web graphics technology a new level of MBI analysis is enabled. web technology allows a direct connection of researchers to the tools and the result visualizations, independent from their whereabouts and their computer system. Modern RIA technologies allow web based visualizations to be interactive and dynamic, which are prerequisites for the analysis of MBI data such as TIS. Although, we presented the w hide tool in the context of TIS analysis it is evident that the tool is applicable to other MBI data such as MALDI images as well.

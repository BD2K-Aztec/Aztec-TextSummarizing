Motivation: rnase q techniques provide an unparalleled means for exploring a transcriptome with deep coverage and base pair level resolution. Various analysis tools have been developed to align and assemble rnase q data, such as the widely used top hat cufflinks pipeline. A common observation is that a sizable fraction of the fragments reads align to multiple locations of the genome. These multiple alignments pose substantial challenges to existing rnase q analysis tools. Inappropriate treatment may result in reporting spurious expressed genes (false positives) and missing the real expressed genes (false negatives). Such errors impact the subsequent analysis, such as differential expression analysis. In our study, we observe that $3.5% of transcripts reported by top hat cufflinks pipeline correspond to annotated nonfunctional pseudogenes. Moreover, $10.0% of reported transcripts are not annotated in the Ensembl database. These genes could be either novel expressed genes or false discoveries. Results: We examine the underlying genomic features that lead to multiple alignments and investigate how they generate systematic errors in rnase q analysis. We develop a general tool, gene scissors which exploits machine learning techniques guided by biological knowledge to detect and correct spurious transcriptome inference by existing rnase q analysis methods. In our simulated study, gene scissors can predict spurious transcriptome calls owing to misalign-ment with an accuracy close to 90%. It provides substantial improvement over the widely used top hat cufflinks or map splice Cufflinks pipelines in both precision and f measurement. On real data, gene scissors reports 53.6% less pseudogenes and 0.97% more expressed and annotated transcripts, when compared with the top hat cufflinks pipeline. In addition, among the 10.0% unannotated transcripts reported by top hat cufflinks gene scissors finds that 416.3% of them are false positives. Availability: The software can be downloaded at

introduction rnase q techniques provide an efficient means for measuring transcriptome data with high resolution and deep coverage (). Millions of short reads sequenced from cDNA provide unique insights into a transcriptome at the nucleotide level and mitigate many of the limitations of microarray data. Although there are still many remaining unsolved problems, new discoveries based on rnase q analysis ranging from genomic imprinting () to differential expression () promise an exciting future. Current rnase q analysis pipelines typically contain two major components: an aligner and an assembler. An rnase q aligner [e.g. top hat (), splice map () and map splice (attempts to determine where in the genome a given sequence comes from. An assembler [e.g. Cufflinks () and Scripture (addresses the problems of which transcripts are present and estimating their abundances. Existing rnase q pipelines can be divided into two major categories: align first pipelines and assembly first pipelines (). assembly first pipelines attempt to assemble and quantify the complete transcriptome without a reference. Several algorithms, such as Trinity () and trans abyss (), have been developed. However, alignment to a reference genome is still necessary to interpret the results from an assembly first pipeline and to relate them to existing knowledge. The assembly first pipeline is compute intensive and may require several days to complete. In align first pipelines, a high quality reference genome serves as a scaffold for inferring the source of rnase q fragments. Current alignment approaches are both computationally efficient and easily parallelized. Thus, the align first rnase q analysis can be finished within hours even on a normal desktop machine. Therefore, align first pipelines such as top hat cufflinks () or map splice cufflinks () are generally preferred when a suitable reference genome is available.

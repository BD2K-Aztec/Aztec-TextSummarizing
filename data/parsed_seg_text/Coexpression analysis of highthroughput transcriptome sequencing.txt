Motivation: In recent years, gene expression studies have increasingly made use of high throughput sequencing technology. In turn, research concerning the appropriate statistical methods for the analysis of digital gene expression (DGE) has flourished, primarily in the context of normalization and differential analysis. Results: In this work, we focus on the question of clustering DGE profiles as a means to discover groups of co-expressed genes. We propose a Poisson mixture model using a rigorous framework for parameter estimation as well as the choice of the appropriate number of clusters. We illustrate co-expression analyses using our approach on two real rnase q datasets. A set of simulation studies also compares the performance of the proposed model with that of several related approaches developed to cluster rnase q or serial analysis of gene expression data. Availability and and implementation: The proposed method is implemented in the open source R package hts cluster available on CRAN.

introduction the application of high throughput sequencing (HTS) to the study of gene expression has revolutionized the scope and depth of understanding of the genome, epi genome and transcriptome of dozens of organisms. In particular, the recent use of HTS technologies to sequence ribonucleic acid content rnase q has rivaled the use of microarrays for transcript omic studies as it offers a way to quantify gene expression without prior knowledge of the genome sequence by providing counts of transcripts. Although both technologies seem to be complementary (), rnase q can provide information about the transcriptome at a level of detail not possible with microarrays, including allele specific expression and transcript discovery. Although a variety of different protocols exist for HTS studies, the same broad preprocessing steps are followed. Namely, if an appropriate genome sequence reference is available, reads are mapped to the genome or transcriptome; otherwise, de novo assembly may be used. After alignment or assembly, read coverage for a given biological entity (e.g. a gene) is subsequently calculated.

These count based measures of gene expression differ substantially from data produced with microarrays. For example, rnase q data are discrete, positive, and highly skewed, with a very large dynamic range. In addition, due to the sampling nature of sequencing, low precision tends to be observed for weakly to moderately expressed genes (). Finally, sequencing depth (i.e. the library size) and coverage vary between experiments, and read counts are known to be correlated with gene length (). To date, most developments concerning the statistical analysis of rnase q data have dealt with the issues of experimental design (), normalization () and the analysis of differential expression (). In this work, we focus on the question of co-expression analyses for rnase q data. Identifying biological entities that share similar profiles across several treatment conditions, such as coexpressed genes, may help identify groups of genes that are involved in the same biological processes (). Clustering analyses based on metric criteria, such as the k means algorithm () and hierarchical clustering (), have been used to cluster microarray based measures of gene expression as they are rapid, simple and stable. However, such methods require both the choice of metric and criterion to be optimized, as well as the selection of the number of clusters. An alternative to such methods are probabilistic clustering models, where the objects to be classified (genes) are considered to be a sample of a random vector and a clustering of the data is obtained by analyzing the density of this vector (). Presently, most proposals for clustering rnase q data have focused on grouping together biological samples rather than biological entities (e.g. genes). For example, Anders and Huber (2010) perform a hierarchical clustering with a Euclidean distance of samples following a variance stabilizing transformation, and cluster fourteen diverse tissues of soybean using hierarchical clustering with Pearson correlation after normalizing the data using a variation of the Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads rp km measure discussed the clustering of samples using hierarchical clustering with a modified log likelihood ratio statistic as distance measure based on a Poisson log linear model; this model is similar to that off or the clustering of Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) gene profiles using a k means algorithm and a Poisson log linear model. More recently considered Poisson and negative binomial mixture models to develop a model based hybrid hierarchical clustering algorithm. In this work, like, we focus on the use of Poisson log linear models for the clustering of count based HTS expression profiles; however, rather than using such a model to define a distance metric to be used in a k means or hierarchical clustering algorithm, we make use of finite mixtures of Poisson log linear models. This framework has the advantage of providing a straightforward procedure for parameter estimation and model selection, as well as a per gene conditional probability of belonging to each cluster.

discussion in this work, we have proposed a method and associated R package hts cluster to cluster count based DGE profiles based on a Poisson mixture model that enables the use of a rigorous framework for parameter estimation (through the EM algorithm) and model selection (through the slope heuristics). The model is parameterized to account for several characteristics of rnase q data, including: (i) a set of normalization factors (s jl ) to account for systematic differences in library size among biological replicates, (ii) a per gene offset parameter (w i ) to account for differences among genes due to overall expression level and (iii) a condition specific cluster effect (k jk ). As the marginal sums of each gene are fixed in the model, variations in expression among experimental conditions may be modeled throughout the extremely large dynamic range of DGE typical of rnase q data. In particular, this parameterization enables a straightforward interpretation of the model, as k jk s j corresponds to the proportion of reads attributed to condition j in cluster k. A co-expression analysis on two sets of real rnase q data highlighted the functionality of hts cluster in practice, in particular with respect to model selection and visualization of overall cluster behavior. Finally, the processing time and memory requirements of hts cluster reflect the fact that parameter estimation must be performed over a large set of models to enable model selection; one run of hts cluster (version 2.0.4) took about 50 minutes and used about 450 MB of memory for the human liver data (K  1;. .. ; 50), and about 2 h with 1800 MB of memory for the fly developmental data (K  1;. .. ; 60). (All analyses were run on a Dell Latitude E6530 quad core 2.70 GHz intel r core tm with 10GB RAM, running a 64-bit version of Windows 7 Professional.) As previously mentioned, hts cluster shares some similarities with other related approaches, although there are several key differences. First, we note that both po isl () and Witten (2011) also make use of an underlying Poisson model; however, rather than using a finite mixture model, the former uses a k means algorithm based on the log likelihood and the latter applies a hierarchical clustering procedure based on a pairwise dissimilarity matrix of dimension (n  n). On the other hand suggest the construction of a hierarchical tree of either Poisson sipo is or negative binomial sin b mixture models with an alternative parameterization to that proposed here. Contrary to all of these alternative related approaches, the hts cluster approach provides a straightforward and robust way to choose the number of clusters present in a given dataset. A set of simulation studies, with parameters selected based on two real datasets, allowed a comparison of hts cluster with the aforementioned related approaches in a controlled scenario. These simulations highlighted the importance of an appropriate procedure to perform model selection, as well as the satisfactory performance of hts cluster in the objective of clustering and estimating the number of clusters. In addition, even when the number of clusters was fixed to the true value, we found that the alternative methods were generally observed to have similar or lower ARI values than hts cluster. However, conclusions from these simulations should be drawn with some caution, particularly as the data were simulated based on a mixture of Poisson distributions. A great deal of discussion has focused on the most appropriate way to simulate rnase q data in the context of differential expression (), and for the time being this remains an open question for co-expression analyses. Finally, we note that in the context of differential expression analyses, the scientific community has generally focused on the use of negative binomial models due to the large variability typically observed among replicates for a fixed gene. This so called over dispersion is modeled via the inclusion of a common dispersion parameter / or a per gene dispersion parameter / i , typically estimated using a shrinkage approach () or a parametric regression fit across all genes (). The sin b approach () recently attempted to apply a similar approach to the task of co-expression analysis through a finite mixture of negative binomial models, where / i is estimated from the data using a quasi likelihood approach and treated as fixed in the mixture. However, for co-expression analyses it is difficult to estimate these per gene dispersion parameters in practice due to the small number of replicates typically available in experiments concerning multiple conditions. A useful direction for future research may be to define a mixture of negative binomial models in which information about this dispersion parameter is shared among genes belonging to the same cluster.

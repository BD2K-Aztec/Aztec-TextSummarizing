gp viz is a versatile java based software for dynamic gene centered visualization of genomic regions and or variants. user defined data can be loaded in common formats as resulting from analysis workflows used in sequencing applications and studied in the context of the gene, the corresponding transcript isoforms, proteins and their domains or other protein features. Both the genomic regions and variants can be also defined interactively. Various gene filter options are provided to enable an intersection of variants, gen-omic regions and affected protein features. Finally, by using gp viz we identified differentially expressed exons, which could indicate alternative splicing events, and found somatic variants in different cancer types affecting metabolic proteins. gp viz is freely available at http:// i cbia tgp viz (released under GNU general public license), is based on Java 7 and can be used as a stand-alone or Web Start application.

introduction recently emerging high throughput sequencing technologies enable the detection of mutations and genomic variants (Single Nucleotide Variants) from exo me or whole genome sequencing data and the identification of differentially expressed exons or transcripts from rnase q data. Several tools are available for mapping features to the genome, including subsequent visualization [e.g. Integrative Genomics Viewer (. To functionally interpret the data, it is necessary to analyze and visualize variants or other genomic features also in the context of proteins and protein domains. Algorithms like Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT) or PolyPhen-2 and other functional impact metrics allow prediction of the effect of variants (i.e. ns snps and amino acid substitution on protein functions [see recent review (. MuSiC () can be applied to perform a proximity analysis of mutations. Another application allows domain mapping of disease mutations (), and within the Ensembl protein summary view () reported mutations can be visualized in the context of protein domains. Alternative splicing and exons can be analyzed and visualized using alt analyze and domain graph (). The web application that covers a number of intended issues to visualize genes, transcripts and protein domains or other features is fancy gene (). Finally, there are a number of further possibilities for visualization of multidimensional genomic and sequencing data (). To the best of our knowledge, an interactive tool for visualization of differentially expressed exons (or defined genomic regions) and nucleotide variants in the context of gene structure, transcript variants and encoded proteins is still missing. To close this gap, we developed gp viz a versatile java based software, which enables this visualization based on the gene and transcript structure (genomic coordinates of exons), gene, protein and domain annotations.

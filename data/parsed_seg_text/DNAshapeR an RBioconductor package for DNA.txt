dna shaper predicts DNA shape features in an ultra-fast, high throughput manner from genomic sequencing data. The package takes either nucleotide sequence or genomic coordinates as input and generates various graphical representations for visualization and further analysis. dna shaper further encodes DNA sequence and shape features as user defined combinations of km er and DNA shape features. The resulting feature matrices can be readily used as input of various machine learning software packages for further modeling studies. Availability and implementation: The dna shaper software package was implemented in the statistical programming language R and is freely available through the Bioconductor project at https:// www bioconductor org packages devel bioc html dna shaper html and at the git hub developer site, http://tsupeichiu.github.io/DNAshapeR/.

Sodium bisulfite conversion followed by sequencing bs seq such as whole genome bisulfite sequencing or reduced representation bisulfite sequencing) has become popular for studying human epigenetic profiles. Identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is important for quantification of methylation levels and for study of allele specific epigenetic events such as imprinting. However, SNP calling in such data is complex and time consuming. Here, we present an ultrafast and memory efficient package named b ssn per for the exploration of SNP sites from bs seq data. Compared with bis snp a popular bs seq specific SNP caller, b ssn per is over 100 times faster and uses less memory. b ssn per also offers higher sensitivity and specificity compared with existing methods. Availability and implementation: b ssn per is written in Cþþ and Perl, and is freely available at https://github.com/hellbelly/BS-Snper.

introduction sodium bisulfite conversion followed by sequencing bs seq has become popular for studying human epigenetic profiles (). Whole genome bisulfite sequencing detects 90% of methylation events and SNPs in the nuclear DNA (). However, its cost remains too high for most laboratories. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) is a more efficient and economical way to monitor genome wide promoter and CpG island methylation status () and it has become a popular method to investigate epigenetic changes in clinical tissue samples (). SNP identification is important for identification of allele specific epigenetic events such as, gamete specific and genetic imprinting (). However, SNP calling from bs seq data has been shown to be complicated. One problem is that reads from two genomic strands are not complementary at methylated loci. Two methods were widely used to solve this problem. One is to align the reads in a three letter space; the other is

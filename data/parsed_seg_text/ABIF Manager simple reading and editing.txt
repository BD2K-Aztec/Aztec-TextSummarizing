ab if Manager is simple application for low level access to ab if formatted files. Those are produced by Data Collection software based on the data, collected from capillary sequencing machine. The application shows all the data as readable text, which can be easily edited. Availability and implementation: The program source code and compiled executable is freely available at: https://sourceforge.net/projects/abifmanager/ Contact: pavel beran centrum cz
introduction although there has been a massive development of next generation sequencing recently, Sanger sequencing method still remains widely used for routine sequencing of DNA fragments (). Results produced by capillary sequencing machines are often analyzed by Data Collection software, which generates ab if (Applied Biosystems Genetic Analysis) formatted files (.ab1, .fsa). All data generated by the software (sequencing machines) are stored in structured directories which forms the resulting file (AB manual). Typical directory of ab if formatted file consists of: Tag name, Tag number, Element type code, Size in bytes of one element, Number of elements in item, Size in bytes of item and Item's data or offset in file and data handle. There are several applications which can show and sometimes modify the data (e.g. Sequence Scanner, Applied Biosystems; chrom as techn elysium Pty Ltd). Most of the applications, however, process the data and show it in user friendly form. Although this approach suits the needs of most users, the data loses some information by the processing. Furthermore, usually not all data contained in the data file are processed by such software. The ab if Manager is a simple, yet powerful application, which reads and writes the directories of ab if formatted file by accessing the directories directly.

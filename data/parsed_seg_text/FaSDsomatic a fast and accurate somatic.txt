Recent advances in high throughput sequencing technologies have enabled us to sequence large number of cancer samples to reveal novel insights into on co genetic mechanisms. However, the presence of intratumoral heterogeneity, normal cell contamination and insufficient sequencing depth, together pose a challenge for detecting somatic mutations. Here we propose a fast and an accurate somatic single nucleotide variations sn vs detection program, fasd somatic. The performance of fasd somatic is extensively assessed on various types of cancer against several state of the art somatic SNV detection programs. Benchmarked by somatic sn vs from either existing databases or de novo higher depth sequencing data, fasd somatic has the best overall performance. Furthermore, fasd somatic is efficient, it finishes somatic SNV calling within 14 h on 50X whole genome sequencing data in paired samples. Availability and implementation: The program, datasets and supplementary files are available at http://jjwanglab.org/FaSD-somatic/.

introduction next generation sequencing and third generation sequencing are widely used to detect genetic mutations from tumor tissues and their paired normal tissues (from the same individual), providing an immense power for understanding the cause of cancer. Besides the inherited germ line mutations, the newly acquired somatic mutations constitute the majority of genetic mutations that cause cancer (). Increasing evidences show that tumoral heterogeneity exists not only in inter tumoral level but also in intratumoral level (). When the sequencing depth is insufficient, the minor clones, which may harbor the meaningful positively selected mutations, could be easily concealed by the dominant clones. Furthermore, owing to the presence of non tumor cells in the bulk of tumor, the proportion of effective covered reads with somatic mutations will decrease, therefore making somatic mutation detection more difficult. Finally, the germ line variants can out number somatic variants by several orders of magnitudes (); this further complicates the difficulty of somatic mutation detection. Efforts have been made by both biologists and bioinformatic ians a to overcome those challenges, but the methods to call somatic single nucleotide variations sn vs directly from sequencing data with accuracy and efficiency are still in demand.

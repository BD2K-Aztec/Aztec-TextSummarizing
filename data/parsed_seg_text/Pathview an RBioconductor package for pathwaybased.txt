introduction the pathway based approach has been widely used in high throughput data analysis (Emmert). It has been successfully and routinely applied to gene expression (both microarray and rnase q (), genetic and g was (), proteomic and metabolomics data (). Compared with the individual gene/ molecule based approach, pathway analysis is more sensitive, consistent and informative (). r bioconductor has become a primary software environment for high throughput data analysis and visualization (). Numerous pathway analysis methods and data types are implemented in r bioconductor yet there has not been a dedicated and established tool for pathway based data integration and visualization. In this article, we introduce a novel package called path view. We did a detailed comparison between path view and existing pathway tools in r bioconductor and other languages in Supplementary Table S2. path view provides three features that are rarely implemented well in other tools: (i) fully accessible and functional pathway visualization. It adheres to human readable pathway definitions and layouts like KEGG (). No previous KEGG base tools provide full graphics, including node edge attribute modifications, node edge labels, legends and color keys ii Strong data integration capacity. It integrates and works with data of different types (different omic levels, literature and so forth), IDs, formats, attributes, species and so forth. As far as we know, no other tool provides such extensive data mapping and integration support. (iii) Easy to automate and integrate with pathway analysis tools. Only a few tools can be directly automated and fully integrated into pathway analysis pipelines (Supplementary: automated analysis column). None of these features are brand new, but surprisingly, few of the existing tools provide satisfactory functionality in these aspects.

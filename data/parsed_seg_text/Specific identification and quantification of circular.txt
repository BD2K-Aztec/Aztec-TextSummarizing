Motivation: Circular RNAs circ rnas are a poorly characterized class of molecules that have been identified decades ago. Emerging high throughput sequencing methods as well as first reports on confirmed functions have sparked new interest in this RNA species. However, the computational detection and quantification tools are still limited. Results: We developed the software tandem, DCC and circ test. DCC uses output from the STAR read mapper to systematically detect back splice junctions in next generation sequencing data. DCC applies a series of filters and integrates data across replicate sets to arrive at a precise list of circ rna candidates. We assessed the detection performance of DCC on a newly generated mouse brain data set and publicly available sequencing data. Our software achieves a much higher precision than state of the art competitors at similar sensitivity levels. Moreover, DCC estimates circ rna versus host gene expression from counting junction and non junction reads. These read counts are finally used to test for host gene independence of circ rna expression across different experimental conditions by our R package circ test. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach on previously reported age dependent circ rnas in the fruit fly.

introduction circ rnas are a recently rediscovered class of abundant and universally expressed RNA species (). The development of software solutions for detecting and quantifying circ rnas is slowly gaining momentum despite the increasing interest in circ rnas. circ rnas are characterized by a back splicing event where the downstream 3 0 splicing 'tail' joins back with the upstream 5 0 splicing 'head' to form a circular RNA structure (see Supplementary). This structure becomes visible in sequencing data as 'scrambled' exons as the co linearity of genome and transcript is violated. However, the existence of back splicing junction reads does not prove the circularity of the transcript of origin. Other mechanisms (e.g. trans splicing may yield such reads, but only circ rnas are depleted in polya enriched samples and resistant to RNAse R treatment. So far, all available algorithms are using these back splicing reads as a key element in circ rna detection. As a consequence, detection performance heavily depends on the employed read mapper and its ability to map circ rna junction reads to the underlying genome or transcriptome. The two most recent addition to the circ rna detection tool set are CIRI () and KNIFE (). Other circ rna detecting pipelines have been published along with research papers but seem to perform worse than the two in the corresponding benchmarks it has been recently shown that circ rnas may vary in their abundance relative to their host gene (). It is interesting to statistically discern cases where circ rna and linear isoform expression are tightly coupled from the ones where expression diverges between the two. To this end, read counts over the back splice junction are typically used as an estimate of circ rna expression and read counts from exons or linear splice junctions as an estimate of the host gene expression.

discussion we present a software tandem for circ rna detection (DCC) and relative quantification circ test. We could show that DCC has a higher precision than its competitors for single and paired end data sets. Moreover, we adapt a statistical framework based on the beta binomial distribution for identifying host gene independent changes in circ rna expression.

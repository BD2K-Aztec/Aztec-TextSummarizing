Motivation: Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by high throughput sequencing chips eq measures the genome wide occupancy of transcription factors in vivo. Different combinations of dna binding protein occupancies may result in a gene being expressed in different tissues or at different developmental stages. To fully understand the functions of genes, it is essential to develop probabilistic models on multiple chips eq profiles to decipher the combinatorial regulatory mechanisms by multiple transcription factors. Results: In this work, we describe a probabilistic model signal spider to decipher the combinatorial binding events of multiple transcription factors. Comparing with similar existing methods, we found signal spider performs better in clustering promoter and enhancer regions. Notably, signal spider can learn higher order combinatorial patterns from multiple chips eq profiles. We have applied signal spider on the normalized chips eq profiles from the ENCODE consortium and learned model instances. We observed different higher order enrichment and depletion patterns across sets of proteins. Those clustering patterns are supported by Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment, evolutionary conservation and chromatin interaction enrichment, offering biological insights for further focused studies. We also proposed a specific enrichment map visualization method to reveal the genome wide transcription factor combinatorial patterns from the models built, which extend our existing fine-scale knowledge on gene regulation to a genome wide level.

introduction in human and other eukaryotes, gene expression is regulated by the binding of various modulatory transcription factors (TF) onto cis regulatory DNA elements near genes. Binding of different combinations of TFs may result in a gene being expressed in different tissues or at different developmental stages. To fully understand a gene's function in the cell, it is essential to identify the TFs that regulate the gene and their corresponding TF binding sites (TFBS) (). The techniques such as protein binding microarray (), microfluidic affinity analysis () and protein microarray assays () enable us to measure the DNA sequence binding of TFs in vitro. On the other hand, the technology of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by microarray chip chip or sequencing chips eq () can efficiently measure the binding occupancy of a particular TF on a genome wide scale in vivo. In a typical chips eq study, the first step is to call the peaks, i.e. determining the precise location in the genome where the TF binds. A number of peak calling tools have been developed, but recent benchmark studies have shown that the peaks from those tools are often inconsistent (). Because multiple transcription factors often work in cis regulatory modules to confer complex gene regulatory programs, it is necessary to develop models on multiple chips eq datasets to decipher the combinatorial dna binding mechanism. In the following, we briefly review some of the previous works in this area. Gerstein et al. used pair-wise peak overlapping patterns to construct a human regulatory network (). Xie et al. proposed self organizing map methods to visualize the colocalization of dna binding proteins (). gian no poul ou et al. proposed a non-negative matrix factorization to elucidate the clustering of dna binding proteins (). Zeng et al. proposed j mosaics to discover histone modification patterns across multiple chips eq datasets (). Ferguson et al. have described a hierarchical Bayes approach to integrate multiple chips eq libraries to improve DNA binding event predictions. Mahony et al. also proposed a mixture model multi gps to detect differential binding enrichment of a dna binding protein in different cell lines, which can improve the protein's DNA binding location predictions (i.e. Cdx2 protein in their study) (). On the other hand, Chen et al. proposed a statistical framework mm chip based on MACS to perform an integrative analysis of multiple ChIP datasets to predict chip enriched regions with known motifs for a given dna binding protein (i.e. ER and CTCF proteins in their study) (*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

On the other hand, Ji et al. proposed a differential principal component analysis method on chips eq to perform unsupervised pattern discovery and statistical inference to identify differential protein dna interactions between two biological conditions (). Guo et al. described a generative probabilistic model (GEM) for high resolution DNA binding site discovery from ChIP data (). Interestingly, that model combines ChIP signals and DNA motif discovery together to achieve precise predictions of the DNA binding locations of a dna binding protein. The authors have further demonstrated how GEM can be applied to reveal spatially constrained transcription factor binding site pairs on a genome. Despite the success of the methods described above, to fully understand a gene's function, it is essential to develop probabilistic models on multiple chips eq profiles to decipher the genome wide combinatorial patterns of dna binding protein occupancy. Unfortunately, the majority of the previous work usually focused on large scale clustering of called peaks, which is an intuitive and straightforward approach. However such approaches have two limitations, as (i) peak calling ignores the contributions from weak bindings of TFs, and (ii) pair-wise analysis ignores the complex combinatorial binding pattern among the TFs. Here we propose a new approach to build fine-scale probabilistic models for directly analyzing multiple normalized chips eq signal profiles on all the promoter and enhancer regions quantitatively so that weak bindings can be taken into account (). Especially, its computational complexity has been carefully designed to scale well with the increasing chips eq data (i.e. linear complexity). After model training, we can extract and reveal the high order combinatorial and quantitative occurrence patterns from the trained probabilistic models for better understandings on the dna binding protein combinatorics.

discussion with the prevalence of chips eq technology, massive chips eq data have been accumulated. The current chips eq data analysis studies usually involve single profile peak calling. Two areas of improvement are currently being explored in the field: how to integrate binding profiles of multiple transcription factors and how to include the signals from the areas that are not called as peaks. In light of that, we have developed a probabilistic model to analyse multiple chips eq signal profiles directly. The model signal spider not only can cluster genome into several region types, but also can extract subtle binding combinations from multiple dna binding proteins. The results show that the proposed model demonstrated performance better than the other existing methods on the simulated data derived from the available chips eq dataset. With the support of GO enrichment analysis, evolutionary conservation, chromatin interaction enrichment analysis and available wet lab studies, we found that the discovered patterns show significant genome wide insights. In particular, the patterns indicate that the genome wide dna binding protein occurrence patterns are far from simple co associative pair-wise interactions. Instead, we observed different higher order enrichment and depletion patterns across different proteins. With increasing available chips eq data, we envision that signal spider will be useful in understanding the genome wide dna binding dynamics.. Examples of conserved regions.

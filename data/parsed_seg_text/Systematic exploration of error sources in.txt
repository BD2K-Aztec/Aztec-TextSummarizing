Motivation: 454 pyrosequencing, by Roche Diagnostics, has emerged as an alternative to Sanger sequencing when it comes to read lengths, performance and cost, but shows higher per base error rates. Although there are several tools available for noise removal, targeting different application fields, data interpretation would benefit from a better understanding of the different error types. Results: By exploring 454 raw data, we quantify to what extent different factors account for sequencing errors. In addition to the well known homopolymer length inaccuracies, we have identified errors likely to originate from other stages of the sequencing process. We use our findings to extend the flows im pipeline with functionalities to simulate these errors, and thus enable a more realistic simulation of 454 pyrosequencing data with flows im
introduction second generation sequencing techniques have revolutionized DNA sequencing. In comparison with Illumina solexa genome Analyzer) and Applied Biosystems (SOLiD), 454 pyrosequencing stands out with its longer reads (up to 500 bp). However, higher sequencing error rates compared with traditional Sanger sequencing and the lack of a detailed understanding of error characteristics still hamper the effective utilization of pyrosequencing. In de novo whole genome sequencing, high coverage may compensate for erroneous sequences. However, erroneous reads are problematic for SNP detection () and especially for meta genomics as they can lead to a considerable overestimation of diversity in a sample (). Hence, there has been a strong focus on examining the quality of 454 pyrosequencing data and noise removal. Also artificial duplicates are an important issue, because they may lead to incorrect conclusions about the abundance of species and genes ().

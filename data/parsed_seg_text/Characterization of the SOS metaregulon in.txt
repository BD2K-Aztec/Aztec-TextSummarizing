Motivation: Data from meta genomics projects remain largely untapped for the analysis of transcriptional regulatory networks. Here, we provide proof of concept that meta genomic data can be effectively leveraged to analyze regulatory networks by characterizing the SOS meta regulon in the human gut microbio me. Results: We combine well established in silico and in vitro techniques to mine the human gut microbio me data and determine the relative composition of the SOS network in a natural setting. Our analysis highlights the importance of trans lesion synthesis as a primary function of the SOS response. We predict the association of this network with three novel protein clusters involved in cell wall biogenesis, chromosome partitioning and restriction modification, and we confirm binding of the SOS response transcriptional repressor to sites in the promoter of a cell wall biogenesis enzyme, a phage integrase and a death on curing protein. We discuss the implications of these findings and the potential for this approach for meta genome analysis.

introduction the unprecedented coverage provided by next generation sequencing technologies has enabled direct sequencing of heterogeneous bacterial populations in their natural habitat. meta genomics projects, therefore, offer a unique window into the genetic composition of microbial ecosystems (). To date, a substantial amount of work has focused on pathway analysis as a method to analyze and compare meta genomic populations (). This approach is particularly suited for reconstructing the multispecies genetic organization of metabolic pathways across a meta genome (). In contrast, non metabolic transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs), such as stress responses, present a different challenge. These networks are typically defined by the functional regulation of their components, rather than by their biochemical interconnections, and their genetic composition can vary significantly across bacteria (). Hence, the mere presence of a particular gene or set of genes within a meta genomic sample does not imply their belonging to a given TRN or the existence of such a network in the sample. Membership to a TRN can be instead defined by the ability of a regulating transcription factor to bind upstream of and directly regulate an operon (). In well studied bacterial transcription factors, the binding motif is known to be conserved at the class or phylum levels (). If the binding motif for the regulating transcription factor is known and can be shown to be conserved for a given subset of the sampled tax a it is hence theoretically possible to reconstruct its associated composite TRN, or meta network at the meta genome level by analyzing sequence data from meta genomic projects. Conservation of the binding motif can be assessed through comparative genomics analyses, which can also be used to validate robust multispecies scoring matrices that are well suited for meta genomic analyses (). The analysis of regulatory networks at the meta genome level presents several potential advantages over genomic analyses. First, it leverages a large and increasing amount of data for regulatory network analysis. Second, it complements a genome centered perspective by providing a glimpse of the regulatory network organization in its natural environment. Finally, it can capture the contribution of uncultured organisms and mobile genetic elements that are poorly represented in genomic data. Here, we explore this approach by analyzing the composition of the bacterial SOS regulon in the human gut microbio me through in silico and in vitro analyses, providing proof of concept for the use of meta genomic data in the inference of regulatory meta networks. The SOS response presents several properties that make it a suitable target to validate this type of analysis. It is a well studied widespread and relatively large network ($40 genes in Escherichia coli) aimed primarily at addressing DNA damage through the activation of repair enzymes, trans lesion synthesis polymerases and cell division inhibitors (Fernandez De). It is also of clinical relevance due to its implication in virulence, mutagenesis and dissemination of antibiotic resistance through the activation of mobile genetic elements (). In addition, it is governed by a repressor (LexA) with a remarkably different distribution in the two clades that constitute bac teroid etes but it targets a *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

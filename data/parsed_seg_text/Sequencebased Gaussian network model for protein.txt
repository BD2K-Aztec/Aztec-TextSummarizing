Motivation: Gaussian network model (GNM) is widely adopted to analyze and understand protein dynamics, function and conformational changes. The existing gnm based approaches require atomic coordinates of the corresponding protein and can not be used when only the sequence is known. Results: We report, first of its kind, GNM model that allows modeling using the sequence. Our linear regression based parameter free sequence derived GNM lpf seq gnm uses contact maps predicted from the sequence and models local, in the sequence, contact neighborhoods with the linear regression. Empirical benchmarking shows relatively high correlations between the native and the predicted with lpf seq gnm b factors and between the cross correlations of residue fluctuations derived from the structure and the sequence based GNM models. Our results demonstrate that lpf seq gnm is an attractive platform to explore protein dynamics. In contrast to the highly used gn ms that require protein structures that number in thousands , our model can be used to study motions for the millions of the readily available sequences, which finds applications in modeling conformational changes, protein protein interactions and protein functions.

introduction protein dynamics, which is associated with ever present thermal fluctuations of atoms and other types of motions that span between rapid (picoseconds) vibrations and relatively slow (microseconds to seconds) movements (), implements various important biological processes and functions (). The X-ray crystallography studies provide information about the thermal motion, which is represented by the debye waller temperature factors or b factors. b factors are proportional to the mean square fluctuations of atomic positions in a crystal due to the thermal motion and positional disorder. They have been studied from a variety of viewpoints in the context of protein function () and their relation with conformational changes on protein protein interactions (), to name just a few. Consequently, the knowledge of b factors provides important insights into the functional dynamics of proteins. Several computational and physical models have been proposed to predict the b factors from protein structures (), electron density maps () and sequences (). To overcome the high computational cost of molecular dynamic simulations (), several structure based computational approaches, such as the coarse grained models including normal mode analysis (), elastic network model (ENM) (), packing density () and weighted contact number () were developed. The en ms including the isotropic Gaussian network model (GNM) () and the anisotropic network model (), define spring like interactions between residues that are within a certain cut off distance. They simplify the computationally costly all atom potentials into a quadratic function in the vicinity of the native state, which allows the decomposition of the motions into vibrational modes with different frequencies, which are known as normal modes. They can determine the (concerted) collective motions of residues that correspond to the lowest frequency modes comprising large parts of a given protein (). Being simple and efficient, ENM and GNM have been widely applied to study many motion problems, such as the molecular mechanisms of the groel groes function (), motor protein motions () and general conformational changes and functions (). Moreover, several variations of the classical en ms ie the classical gn ms and anisotropic network models) () have been developed for better modeling of protein dynamics (). However, these methods require the knowledge of protein structure, which limits their applications to thousands of known structures, in contrast to the millions of known non-redundant protein sequences. The sequence based predictors use only the protein sequences as their input and thus, they are suitable for the analysis of the *To whom correspondence should be addressed this is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/), which permits non-commercial re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

Nevertheless, the main drawback of these sequence based predictors is that they predict only the b factor values of the C atoms, and they do not provide the information about the collective motions. Motivated by recent advances in high throughput sequencing and lagging of the current structure determination pipelines, a sequence based model would be invaluable to advance our understanding of protein motion and flexibility. We address this need by proposing a novel sequence based GNM seq gnm that uses contact maps predicted from the sequences with the nnc on method (). Furthermore, inspired by a finding that strength of the relation between solvent accessibility and flexibility of residues improves when considering a local neighborhood in the sequence () and the development of the local contact density model (), we enhance seq gnm by using a linear regression that quantifies relation between the local predicted contacts and the flexibility. We illustrate the benefits of the seq gnm by applying it to predict b factors and collective motions of residues. We demonstrate that results from seq gnm are comparable with the outputs from the structure based gn ms
discussion the b factors reflect the residue fluctuations and static, dynamic and lattice disorders. However, they depend on the experimental resolution, crystal contacts and refinement procedures, which is why the b factor profiles of homologous protein are shown to be correlated with each other with the ACC of 0.80 (). This constitutes an approximate upper limit for the prediction of the b factor values, which applies to the considered gnm based models have recently proposed a new distance dependent parameter free GNM in which residue pairs are weighted by the inverse square of their distances. This pfg nm method had been shown to outperform the classical distance cut off based GNM in prediction the b factors. Here, the proposed seq gnm methods, pf seq gnm and lpf seq gnm predict the b factors with comparably (to the structure based method) high correlations equal 0.49 and 0.52 on the PDB951 dataset, and 0.50 and 0.53 on the PDB748.

The colors range between red (strong positive correlations) and blue (strong negative correlations) dataset, respectively. We demonstrate that the pfg nm is also advantageous for our sequence based approach, i.e. we show that the pf seq gnm outperforms the classical seq gn ms. Furthermore, motivated by the findings concerning the impact of local contact density and local solvent accessibility on the residue flexibility expressed with the b factors (), we use linear regression to model the relation between the local predicted contacts and the residue flexibility. This led to the development of an improved pf seq gnm that uses the local contacts, which is called lpf seq gnm. Our empirical results suggest that this model provides useful predictions of the residue flexibility and the collective residue motions. The key advantage of the seq gnm is that it can be applied to proteins with unknown structures and known sequences, which number in millions. In contrast, the existing and widely adopted structure based gn ms are limited to a much smaller subpopulation of proteins with known structure. Our model finds numerous applications in modeling of protein motion, conformational changes, protein protein interactions and protein functions, to name just a few.

Cell differentiation processes are achieved through a continuum of hierarchical intermediate cell states that might be captured by single cell RNA seq. Existing computational approaches for the assessment of cell state hierarchies from single cell data can be formalized under a general framework composed of (i) a metric to assess cell to cell similarities (with or without a dimensionality reduction step) and (ii) a graph building algorithm (optionally making use of a cell clustering step). The since ll R package implements a methodological toolbox allowing flexible workflows under such a framework. Furthermore, since ll contributes new algorithms to provide cell state hierarchies with statistical support while accounting for stochastic factors in single cell RNA seq. Graphical representations and functional association tests are provided to interpret hierarchies. The functionalities of since ll are illustrated in a real case study, which demonstrates its ability to discriminate noisy from stable cell state hierarchies. Availability and implementation: since ll is an open source r bioconductor package available at http://bioconductor.org/packages/sincell. A detailed manual and a vignette are provided with the package.

introduction unbiased profiling of individual cells through single cell rnase q allows assessing heterogeneity of transcriptional states within a cell population (). In the context of a cell population's differentiation or activation process, such transcriptional heterogeneity might reflect a continuum of intermediate cell states and lineages resulting from dynamic regulatory programs. Such a continuum might be captured through the assessment of cell state hierarchies, where each cell is placed in a relative ordering in the transcriptional landscape. Additionally, statistical support should be provided to discriminate reliable hierarchies from stochastic heterogeneity, arising from both technical and biological factors a number of algorithms have been used to assess cell state hierarchies from single cell data (). These approaches can be formalized under a general framework (Supplementary). Here we present since ll an r bioconductor package where the various building blocks of that general workflow are extended and combined (). Notably, since ll implements algorithms to provide statistical support to the cell state hierarchies derived from single cell rnase q. The package is complemented with graphical representations and functional association tests to help interpret the results.

description as input, since ll requires an expression matrix with user defined normalized gene expression levels per single cell (). Variance stabilization is recommended (e.g. through log transformation). First, a cell to cell distance matrix is calculated using a metric of choice. since ll provides both linear and non-linear distances: Euclidean, Mutual Information, L1 distance, Pearson and Spearman correlation. Optionally, the distance matrix may be obtained from the leading dimensions of a data reduction technique, performed to keep the most informative parts of the data while excluding noise. Both linear and non-linear algorithms are provided: Principal Component Analysis, Independent Component Analysis, t distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding and non metric Multidimensional Scaling. Second, a cell state hierarchy is obtained by applying a graph building algorithm on the cell to cell distance matrix. graph building algorithms may consider cells both individually and in clusters of highly similar cells. since ll provides different clustering methods k mutual Nearest Neighbors, kme do ids agglomerative clustering, etc.) and graph building algorithms (MST, SST and IMC; Supplementary Text). Stochastic technical and biological factors may drive cell state heterogeneity observed in single cell RNA seq data. Additionally, hierarchies derived from experiments with a low number of individual cells (e.g. 96 cells when using a fluid igm C1 TM single cell Auto Prep System) are more susceptible to noise artifacts than experiments profiling thousands of individual cells (e.g. flow cytometry data). since ll implements two algorithms to discriminate reliable hierarchies from noise driven ones. The first strategy relies on a gene resampling procedure. The second one is based on random cell substitution with in silico generated cell replicates. These replicates are built by perturbing observed gene expression levels with random noise, following patterns of stochasticity observed in single cell rnase q (Supplementary Text). Either approach generates a population of hierarchies whose similarities to the reference show the distribution of the hierarchy stability against changes in the data. To help interpret hierarchies in functional terms, since ll provides graphical representations of cell to cell similarities in low dimensional space as well as different graph displays of hierarchies, coloring cells, e.g. by expression levels of a marker of choice. Furthermore, since ll implements an algorithm to determine the statistical significance of the association of the hierarchy with the expression levels of a given gene set (Supplementary Text). Gene set collections (e.g. Gene Ontology terms) can be systematically evaluated.

Motivation: Recent transcriptome studies have revealed that total transcript numbers vary by cell type and condition; therefore, the statistical assumptions for single cell transcriptome studies must be revisited. sam strt is an extension code for sam seq which is a statistical method for differential expression, to enable spike in normaliza-tion and statistical testing based on the estimated absolute number of transcripts per cell for single cell rnase q methods. Availability and Implementation: sam strt is implemented on R and available in git hub (https://github.com/shka/R-SAMstrt).

introduction unbiased molecular measurements are required to form precise hypotheses on molecular mechanisms, and measurements at single cell resolution can give detailed snapshots of heterogeneous cell cultures or tissues. Recently described single cell mRNA sequencing technology is one promising method for such purposes (). However, the statistical assumptions in the traditional tests for differential expression are not necessarily applicable, as the total mRNA molecules per cell could be different by cell types (), and sensitivity over the experiments is less consistent than in the other methods that use large amounts of input mRNA. One possible solution is the addition of a known number of spike in control RNA molecules to each cell lysate, which can be used to normalize and convert read counts to (estimated) molecule numbers. In the present study, we used the single cell tagged reverse transcription (STRT) method () to investigate key issues for statistical tests, in several control experiments, and then implement and demonstrate a new concept for differential expression test on single cell transcriptome profiles.

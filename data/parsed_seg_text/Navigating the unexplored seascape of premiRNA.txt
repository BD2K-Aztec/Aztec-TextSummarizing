Motivation: The computational search for novel microRNA (miRNA) precursors often involves some sort of structural analysis with the aim of identifying which type of structures are prone to being recognized and processed by the cellular mirna maturation machinery. A natural way to tackle this problem is to perform clustering over the candidate structures along with known miRNA precursor structures. Mixed clusters allow then the identification of candidates that are similar to known precursors. Given the large number of pre mirna candidates that can be identified in single genome approaches, even after applying several filters for precursor robustness and stability, a conventional structural clustering approach is unfeasible. Results: We propose a method to represent candidate structures in a feature space, which summarizes key sequence structure characteristics of each candidate. We demonstrate that proximity in this feature space is related to sequence structure similarity, and we select candidates that have a high similarity to known precursors. Additional filtering steps are then applied to further reduce the number of candidates to those with greater transcriptional potential. Our method is compared with another single genome method triplets vm in two datasets, showing better performance in one and comparable performance in the other, for larger training sets. Additionally, we show that our approach allows for a better interpretation of the results.

introduction micrornas (miRNAs) constitute one of several classes of small RNAs found in plant and animal branches of Eukaryota. Since the discovery of the first miRNAs in Caenorhabditis elegans (), an abundant number of these regulatory RNAs (ranging from 18 to 25 nt in length) have been discovered and their underlying mechanisms investigated [for an overview see e.g.. MiRNAs originate from the maturation of larger precursors of approximately 70 nt called pre mirnas. An important feature of pre mirnas that elicits their recognition by the mirna processing machinery is their secondary structure. pre mirnas typically exhibit a stem loop structure with few internal loops or asymmetric bulges but the variety of structures that are efficiently recognized has escaped any strict characterization (). Previously, we proposed a combination of measures that distinguishes true pre mirnas from the large number of stem loops that can be found in metazoan genomes (). However, the number of precursor candidates (in the order of a few hundred thousand) obtained above the optimal cut off of the score, which combines measures of stability and robustness, is still im practically large to be subjected to experimental confirmation (see the crave la framework website for further details: http:///www. crave la org. Despite the fact that all these candidates consist of or contain stem loops the details of their secondary structure have not been subjected to a thorough analysis. The most immediate approach to analyzing the variety of pre mirnas in our candidate set is to seek the identification of structural families amongst the precursor candidates. Although miRNAs have been grouped into families according to their sequence similarity in the mir base database (), this approach does not give enough insight as to the structural features that are important for the recognition by the mirna processing machinery. Hence, the grouping has to be performed according to sequence and structure. Various algorithmic approaches have been introduced to determine structural similarities and to derive consensus structure patterns for structural RNAs with low sequence identity (). A first approach toward the clustering of miRNAs has been achieved in, where *To whom correspondence should be addressed.  The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

However, all these approaches suffer from a high computational complexity, with a time requirement typically between O(n 4 ) and O(n 6 ). It is thus computationally unfeasible to cluster hundreds of thousands of candidates using this approach. Thus, instead of trying to cluster the candidate set, we summarize the structural and sequence features of each candidate using a vectorial representation and attempt to identify the region of the feature space most likely to contain hairpins recognized by the cellular mirna processing machinery. Furthermore, using samples of the candidate set, we show that the relative positions of the representations of the candidates in the feature space are reminiscent of the partitions derived from a conventional clustering performed with the state of the art sequence structure alignment tool loca rna (). And, most importantly, we observe that known precursors are represented in a limited portion of the feature space. We use this approach to analyse a set of robust and stable hairpins extracted from a genome wide scan () of Anopheles gambiae and Drosophila melanogaster, greatly reducing the number of candidates. A further reduction is achieved by assessing the transcriptional potential of each remaining candidate and, by additionally restricting our analysis to candidates with the potential of being part of miRNA genomic clusters, we obtain a dataset which is small enough to be subjected to experimental verification.

conclusion we have presented a method to assess the sequence structure similarity of a large dataset of hairpins in search for novel pre mirnas and we have placed these candidates in a multidimensional space in a way that reflects their structural characteristics. The portion of the multidimensional space selected around the known pre mirnas purports to include most structures which have the potential of being efficiently recognized by the cellular mirna processing machinery. The fact that this region is very dense in terms of the number of precursor candidates it contains, tells us that a large number of genome locations have the potential to generate stable and robust structures which present sequence structure similarities to known pre mirnas. The use of annotation information helps reducing the number of selected candidates but after this filtering step, which is nevertheless dependent on the quality and breadth of the available annotation data, they remain in the tens of thousands. Therefore, there is either an exceedingly large number of pre mirnas in these datasets or, more plausibly, most of these candidates are not efficiently transcribed but could otherwise be recognized as miRNA precursors. The initial set of candidates extracted from the genomes of a gambiae and d melanogaster and described in Mendes et al.(2010) consisted of 2 245 014 and 1 316 305 candidates, respectively. The total number of candidates, after applying stability and robustness measures described in earlier work and the structural analysis along with the annotation filtering detailed in this article, is reduced by two orders of magnitude to 44 210 and 40 582. Unlike many machine learning approaches to the identification of miRNA precursors that use features of the sequence and secondary structure to provide a classifier, our approach does not need to postulate a set of negative examples. In fact, we contend that if the purpose is to characterize the structures which have the potential of being recognized by the enzymes involved in miRNA maturation, one needs to reduce one's dependence on the positive set as well, because it will most likely not be representative it suffices to observe that the set of recognizable structures is surely larger than the set of all the pre mirnas contained in the genome and that these two sets are subject to different evolutionary constraints. In our work, information about known precursors is used merely to pinpoint a region of interest in our multidimensional representation of sequence structure features. Admittedly, this approach is not guaranteed to identify the entire portion of the feature space where structures recognizable by the mirna processing machinery are located, because such a subspace is surely much larger than the examples that could ever be instantiated in any genome. However, our method outperforms a machine learning approach based on a SVM in one dataset and has comparable performance with the other, for larger training sets. For sample groups with a greater number of positive examples it outperforms the machine learning method in both datasets. One can further limit the candidates to those occurring in the genomic vicinity of known precursors and which could, therefore, be part of miRNA clusters together with pre documented pre mirnas. This approach produces a greatly reduced set of candidates (439 for a gambiae and 1604 for d melanogaster even using a very liberal definition of miRNA cluster. This significant reduction of the number of candidates, albeit at the expense of the ability to identify novel miRNAs located elsewhere in the genome, elicits both the possibility of experimental validation and further detailed computational analyses. To this effect, it was possible to identify several plausible miRNA clusters with structurally similar stem loops by performing

Motivation: Protocols to generate strand specific transcriptome s with next generation sequencing platforms have been used by the scientific community roughly since 2008. strand specific reads allow for detection of antisense events and a higher resolution of expression profiles enabling extension of current transcript annotations. However, applications making use of this stranded ness information are still scarce. Results: Here we present a tool (Janus), which focuses on the identification of transcriptional active regions in antisense orientation to known and novel transcribed elements of the genome. Janus can compare the antisense events of multiple samples and assigns scores to identify mutual expression of either transcript in a sense/ antisense pair, which could hint to regulatory mechanisms. Janus is able to make use of single nucleotide variant (SNV) and methylation data, if available, and reports the sense to antisense ratio of regions in the vicinity of the identified genetic and epigenetic variation. Janus interrogates positions of heterozygous sn vs to identify strand specific allelic imbalance. Availability: Janus is written in C/Cþþ and freely available at http:// wwwikmbunikieldejanusjan us html under terms of GNU General Public License, for both, Linux and Windows 64Â. Although the bin-aries will work without additional downloads, the software depends on bam tools (https://github.com/pezmaster31/bamtools) for compilation.

introduction the ancient Greek historian Plutarch writes about Janus: 'For this Janus, whether in remote antiquity he were a demigod or a king, was certainly a great lover of civil and social unity, and one who reclaimed men from brutal and savage living; for which reason they figure him with two faces, to represent the two states and conditions out of the one of which he brought mankind, to lead them into the other.' plutarch us 75 A.C.E.). We decided to call our tool Janus, as it observes transcription of the double stranded DNA, which often happens in opposite directions at a given locus. We term the transcription occurring on the strand opposite to the template strand 'antisense' transcription. Antisense transcripts may have a regulatory effect on the expression of the sense transcript, which has been reported for several sense antisense (S/AS) pairs before, for example, in the x chromosomal inactivation involving XIST and t six (). Another example is given by Morris et al., who reported that expression of the p21 antisense transcript mediates methylation of the p21 sense promoter by recruitment of epigenetic regulatory complexes and showed that this effect was reversible by small interfering RNA sirna induced knockdown of the antisense transcript (). Published data about antisense transcription are sometimes contradictory, underlining the high complexity of the matter published an article in which they investigated S/AS patterns in different human cell lines using the Illumina GA, detecting a high abundance of antisense tags within exons (). In contrast, in an article published by used the SOLiD system, only few antisense tags were detected in the coding regions of genes (). However, both articles agree on an abundance of antisense transcription occurring in promoter and terminator regions. To the best of our knowledge, no publicly available tool has been released to the scientific community to easily identify S/AS pairs using next generation sequencing data. To address this, we developed Janus. It allows identification of S/AS pairs on the genome wide level, using common input formats of sequencing data from strand specific experiments, and detects differences between multiple samples. It is capable of including methylation data in the results and investigates S/AS ratios at single nucleotide variant (SNV) positions. Janus was developed to work under Linux and Windows, but is restricted to 64-bit environments owing to the memory requirements. *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Motivation: Epistasis analysis is an essential tool of classical genetics for inferring the order of function of genes in a common pathway. Typically, it considers single and double mutant phenotypes and for a pair of genes observes whether a change in the first gene masks the effects of the mutation in the second gene. Despite the recent emergence of biotechnology techniques that can provide gene interaction data on a large, possibly genomic scale, few methods are available for quantitative epistasis analysis and epistasis based network reconstruction. Results: We here propose a conceptually new probabilistic approach to gene network inference from quantitative interaction data. The approach is founded on epistasis analysis. Its features are joint treatment of the mutant phenotype data with a factorized model and probabil-istic scoring of pairwise gene relationships that are inferred from the latent gene representation. The resulting gene network is assembled from scored pairwise relationships. In an experimental study, we show that the proposed approach can accurately reconstruct several known pathways and that it surpasses the accuracy of current approaches.

introduction epistasis analysis is a tool of classical genetics for inferring the order of genes in pathways from mutant based phenotypes (). Epistasis asserts that two genes interact if the mutation in one gene masks the effects of perturbations in the other gene. Then, assuming a common pathway, the first masking gene would be downstream, and the products of the second gene would regulate the expression of the first one (). Epistasis analysis uncovers the relationship between a pair of genes. Its logic can be further extended to uncover parallelism, where both genes have an effect on the phenotype but where there is no epistasis () (). Uncovered pairwise relationships in a group of genes can give rise to a reconstruction of more complex multi-gene networks. An enlightening demonstration of the power of epistasis for assembly of gene networks is for instance a reconstruction of a four gene cell death pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans (). Emergent technologies from molecular biology that record phenotypes of single and double mutants at a large, possibly genomic scale, prompt for the development of systematic approaches for epistasis analysis and pose the need to devise computational tools that support gene network inference. Approaches of mutagenesis by homologous recombination () or RNA interference can yield phenotype observations for thousands or even millions of mutants (). Several past studies considered mutant assays with qualitative phenotypes (Zupan *To whom correspondence should be addressed hypothetical example of epistasis analysis with three genes, u, v and w. Nodes in the central graph represent mutant phenotypes. The phenotypic difference between a double knockout [e.g. Ru"v"] and a single knockout mutant eg is represented with the length of the corresponding dotted edge. Expected double mutant phenotypes, which assume no interaction between genes (see also Section 2.1), are denoted with E [e.g.. A double mutant u"v" (a) has a phenotype similar to that of a single mutant v", which indicates that v is epistatic to u. From the activity of genes v and w (b) we conjecture that gene v partially depends on gene w, i.e. v also acts through a separate pathway because their double mutant v"w" has a phenotype that is equally similar to the single knockout Rw" and the expected phenotype e vw. The phenotype of double knockout u"w" (c) is close to the expected phenotype of u"w"; eu w which may be explained by u and w acting independently in parallel pathways.

Majority of these studies present gene networks as collections of directly observed pairwise interactions (e.g.) and do not propose a generally applicable formalism to model the data. Only few general purpose algorithms for inference of epistatic networks have been proposed introduced formal rules and inference algorithm to infer different types of relationships between genes, but could treat only qualitative phenotypes and could not handle noise. These limitations were elegantly bypassed by a Bayesian approach of Battle et al. (2010) that can handle larger data sets with few hundred genes. This algorithm is to our knowledge also the only modern approach to inference of epistasis networks. Gene epistasis analysis infers interactions that stem directly from mutant phenotypes. Its causative reasoning is different from other network reconstruction tools that observe correlations between gene profiles (e.g.) and infer relationships that are circumstantial (). Despite the growing body of quantitative genetic interaction data and our ability to collect such data, computational approaches and tools to support epistasis are at best scarce (). Devising methods for inference of gene pathways from mutant based phenotypes and developing related software tools remains a major challenge of computational systems biology. We here present a new epistasis analysis inspired computational approach to infer gene networks from a collection of quantitative mutant phenotypes. We refer to our method as R ed (pronounced as r ed, meaning 'order' in Slovene). Our work was motivated by the Bayesian learning method of, henceforth denoted by activity pathway network (APN), that starts from a random network and then iteratively refines it to best match data inferred relationships. The model refinement in APN is carried out through a succession of local structural changes of the evolving network. This procedure may substantially depend on (arbitrary) initialization of network structure, and hence requires ensembl ing across many runs of the algorithm to raise accuracy of the final network. Our approach is conceptually different from APN. We first simultaneously infer a probabilistic model for the entire set of pairwise relationships. Relationship probabilities serve as preferences for different types of pairwise relationships (e.g. epistasis, parallelism and partial interdependence) used in a single step construction of a gene network. In contrast to APN's local network changes, R ed applies a global procedure to infer the relationships between genes and does not require ensembl ing. The probabilistic model of R ed uses matrix completion derived latent data representation to account for noise and sparsity. Inference of factorized model also includes construction of a gene specific data transformation to account for the differences in single mutant backgrounds, which may affect the phenotype of double mutants. In an experimental study, we show that both components are necessary for inferring gene networks of high accuracy.

conclusion r ed is a conceptually new approach for inference of gene networks from quantitative genetic interaction data. It implements a probabilistic epistasis analysis and assembles pairwise relationships into gene networks. In our experiments, R ed was able to reconstruct several known and partially known pathways with accuracy above that of the state of the art approaches. R ed outperforms APN, the state of the art method by, both in accuracy and speed, with CPU runtime of only a few minutes compared with APN's 30 min for an inference of a single full network in an ensemble of 500 networks. We also show that R ed's power of generalization comes from its two key components, a factorized model with latent representation of gene interactions and a gene dependent logistic map of interaction scores. Our evaluation in this article was computational and thus limited to datasets for which several gene pathways or at least partial gene orderings were available (). R ed can efficiently handle similar datasets as well as much larger ones, such as that from the recent yeast experiments by. These are also the datasets for which we foresee future applications of R ed and which will require subsequent verification of inferred networks in the wet lab.

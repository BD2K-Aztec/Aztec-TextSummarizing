Motivation: One of the most promising applications of biosynthetic methods is to produce chemical products of high value from the ready-made chemicals. To explore the biosynthetic potentials of a chemical as a synthesis precursor, biosynthetic databases and related chemo informatics tools are urgently needed. In the present work, a web based tool, bio synth er is developed to explore the biosynthetic potentials of precursor chemicals using bkm react Rhea, and more than 50 000 in house rxn finder reactions manually curated. bio synth er allows researchers to explore biosyn-thetic potentials, through so far known biochemical reactions, step by step interactively, which could be used as a useful tool in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.

introduction biosynthesis has important applications in producing bulk chemicals (), biofuels () or natural products (). There are some biosynthesis informatics tools (), such as b nice (), retro path (), de sharky () and FMM (), to design biosynthesis pathways from a start molecule to a target molecule. In industrial biotechnology applications, researchers usually plan to get value added chemicals from the ready-made molecules. That is, how to automatically explore the biosynthetic potentials of simple chemical precursors? In the present work, bio synth er is developed to assist researchers to get comprehensive biosynthesis target molecules based on the bkm react reactions (), Rhea reactions () and in house rxn finder () reactions www rxn finder org

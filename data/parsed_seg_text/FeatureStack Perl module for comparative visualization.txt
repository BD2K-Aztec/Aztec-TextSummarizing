introduction comparative analysis of gene structures is important for understanding gene function and evolution. To facilitate gene structure comparison, multiple related gene models need to be shown side by side in a single compact image. In addition, sequence features such as protein domains should be highlighted for functional annotation and to provide reference points for comparison (). Few specialized tools have been developed for the comparative visualization of gene structures, including fancy gene (), gec a () and g sds (). fancy gene provides rich annotation options but is limited to the display of a single genomic locus and image generation can not be automated. Conversely, gec a and g sds allow rapid image generation for many genes, but options to highlight sequence features on top of gene models are limited. Here, we present two Perl modules, bio draw feature stack and bio graphics glyph decorated gene which build upon existing BioPerl () and bio graphics () functionality for the highly generic and versatile visualization of multiple gene structures. When used in combination, these two modules allow for fully automated and yet highly configurable image generation, which greatly facilitates comparisons of many gene structures.

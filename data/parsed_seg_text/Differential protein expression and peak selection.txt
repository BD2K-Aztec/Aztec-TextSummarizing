Motivation: Proteomic mass spectrometry analysis is becoming routine in clinical diagnostics, for example to monitor cancer biomarkers using blood samples. However, differential proteomics and identification of peaks relevant for class separation remains challenging. Results: Here, we introduce a simple yet effective approach for identifying differentially expressed proteins using binary discriminant analysis. This approach works by data adaptive thresholding of protein expression values and subsequent ranking of the dichotomized features using a relative en-tropy measure. Our framework may be viewed as a generalization of the peak probability contrast approach of Tibshirani et al. (2004) and can be applied both in the two group and the multi group setting. Our approach is computationally inexpensive and shows in the analysis of a large scale drug discovery test dataset equivalent prediction accuracy as a random forest. Furthermore, we were able to identify in the analysis of mass spectrometry data from a pancreas cancer study biological relevant and statistically predictive marker peaks unrecognized in the original study. Availability and implementation: The methodology for binary discriminant analysis is implemented in the R package bind a which is freely available under the GNU General Public License (version 3 or later) from CRAN at URL http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/binda/. R scripts reproducing all described analyzes are available from the web page http://strimmerlab.org/software/binda/.

introduction mass spectrometry, a high throughput technology commonly used in proteomics, enables the measurement of the abundance of proteins, metabolites, peptides and amino acids in biological samples. The study of changes in protein expression across subgroups of samples and through time provides valuable insights into cellular mechanisms and offers a means to identify relevant biomarkers, e.g. to distinguish among tissue types, or for predicting health status. In practice, however, there still remain many analytic and computational challenges to be addressed, especially in clinical diagnostics (). A recent overview of statistical issues in the analysis of proteomics mass spectrometry data is Morris (2012) who discusses a wide range of methods ranging from data preprocessing, i.e. removal of systematic bias, peak identification, peak alignment and quantification and calibration of relative peak intensities, to methods for high level statistical analysis, such as peak ranking and classification. Of particular importance is the problem of differential protein expression and the identification of peaks informative for group separation and class prediction. A special characteristic of mass spectrometry data is their dual valued nature, i.e. they contain both continuous as well as discrete information. Specifically, a protein may be differentially expressed if its intensity of expression varies among groups and is relatively up or down-regulated, or if a corresponding peak is either absent or present in a specific group. Consequently, mass spectrometry intensity matrices typically contain very large amounts of missing values, which renders application of standard statistical methodology from other omics platforms, such as regularized t scores difficult and potentially suboptimal. Accordingly, this has initiated the development of new statistical methodology (). Two main strategies to address this issue in the high level analysis of mass spectrometry data have emerged: 1. All data are treated as continuous, with missing intensity values set to zero or imputed. Subsequently, standard omics methods are employed, such as t scores for feature selection (e.g.). 2. The absence presence data are used for data analysis in conjunction with the intensity values propose peak probability contrasts (PPCs), the absolute difference in frequency of occurrence of a peak, for ranking and feature selection, and also use PPC to improve absence presence data by dicho to mization of intensity values propose a test based on the PPC statistic and propose to apply joint false discovery rate control of the union of intensity based and ppc based rankings here we follow the second route and propose a novel coherent model for differential protein expression and prediction based on binary discriminant analysis bind a. Our approach may be viewed as a generalization of and comprises the following: @BULLET The binary absence presence data are explicitly modeled by a multivariate Bernoulli (MVB) distribution. @BULLET multi group binary discriminant analysis bind a is employed for feature ranking, variable selection and prediction. @BULLET For ranking of peaks the natural relative entropy variable importance measure coherent with bind a is used, rather than PPC. @BULLET Likewise, for dicho to mization of the intensity data matrix containing missing values we employ the same entropy based criterion as a result, we obtain simple principled framework for analyzing dual valued mass spectrometry data without the need for imputation, with a natural measure for variable ranking and for differential protein expression, and with coherent prediction rules. In contrast to many other methods this approach also allows multiple groups as response variable, and thus extends beyond simple pairwise comparisons. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Next, we describe in detail the statistical methodology underlying bind a. Then, for validation we investigate the performance of the proposed approach in comparison with a random forest on a large scale chemo metric dataset. Subsequently, we present a detailed case study analyzing mass spectrometry data from a pancreas cancer study. For reproducibility, we provide the R package bind a implementing our approach and R scripts for all analyzes described. Finally, we discuss applicability of the bind a approach to other molecular data as well as further extensions.

discussion we have presented a simple yet effective approach to differential expression and classification for mass spectrometry data using bind a. Our approach may be viewed as generalization of and can be applied also for multi group discriminant analysis. A particular feature is the use of the same relative entropy criterion for peak ranking and selection and for dicho to mization of the continuous protein intensity data. In addition, we obtain decision thresholds from the protein intensities that are biologically and diagnostically easy to interpret. In illustrative analysis of high dimensional drug discovery data we showed that our approach implemented in the R package bind a is computationally effective and yet competitive with a random forest. Furthermore, in reanalysis of proteomics data from a pancreas cancer study we found statistically predictive marker peaks to tumor cell growth unrecognized in the original analysis. This confirms the importance of reproducible research in proteomics, where it is unfortunately still not common to provide analysis scripts and software openly. In addition to mass spectrometry analysis, there are many bioinformatics applications in which binary data are collected, and hence, in which the present methodology and software will potentially be useful. Examples include meta genomics where the absence and presence of proteins and genes is compared with a pan genome (), community analysis by DNA fingerprinting (), and chemometrics (). Exploring additional applications may also lead to further methodological extensions of the procedures currently implemented in bind a such as modeling over dispersion e.g. by employing the beta bernoulli rather than Bernoulli distribution, and to take account of interactions among predictors, e.g. by modeling pair-wise correlation.

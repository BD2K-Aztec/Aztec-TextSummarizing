DNA methylation is an important mechanism regulating gene transcription, and its role in carcinogenesis has been extensively studied. Hyper and hypo methylation of genes is an alternative mechanism to deregulate gene expression in a wide range of diseases. At the same time, high throughput DNA methylation assays have been developed generating vast amounts of genome wide DNA methylation measurements. Yet, few tools exist that can formally identify hypo and hyper methylated genes that are predictive of transcription and thus functionally relevant for a particular disease. To accommodate this lack of tools, we developed methyl mix an algorithm implemented in R to identify disease specific hyper and hypo methylated genes. methyl mix is based on a beta mixture model to identify methylation states and compares them with the normal DNA methylation state. methyl mix introduces a novel metric, the Differential Methylation value or dm value defined as the difference of a methylation state with the normal methylation state. Finally, matched gene expression data are used to identify, besides differential, transcriptionally predictive methylation states by focusing on methylation changes that effect gene expression.

introduction dna methylation is one of the most studied epigenetic aberrations underlying oncogenesis. Besides genetic mutations, hyper and hypo methylation of genes is an alternative mechanism that is capable of altering the normal state and driving a wide range of diseases. Prior studies have identified hypo or hypermethylation based on heuristic measures for example in breast cancer (). Additionally, computational methods have been developed to identify differentially methylated regions for specific DNA methylation platforms (). However, few methods formalize the identification of DNA methylation driven genes using a model based approach. We identified three key criteria that should be addressed to derive key methylation driven genes. First, the determination of the degree of methylation can not hinge on arbitrary thresholds as is commonly done. Second, the assessment of a gene as hyper or hypo methylated must be made in comparison to normal tissue. Finally, the identification of genes that are hyper or hypo methylated should be transcriptionally predictive effect, thereby implying that their methylation is functionally relevant. We designed methyl mix to accommodate these three criteria to identify methylation driven genes in diseases. @BULLET Step ii: The methylation states of a gene are identified using univariate beta mixture modeling to identify subgroups of patients with similar DNA methylation level for a specific CpG site. We use the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to select the number of methylation states by iteratively adding a new mixture component if the BIC score improves. Each beta mixture component is referred to as a methylation state and represented by its mean methylation level. @BULLET Step iii: Hyper and hypo methylated genes are defined relative to normal by comparing the methylation levels of each methylation state to the mean of the DNA methylation levels of normal tissue samples using a Wilcoxon rank sum test. Based on this test, Differential Methylation values or dm values are created defined as the difference of a methylation state with the normal methylation state. Genes with methylation states different from normal are called differential genes. The final output of methyl mix is genes that are both transcriptionally predictive and differential together with the parameters of their methylation states. Additionally, a matrix of dm values is part of the output and can be used in subsequent analysis, for example to define methylation driven subgroups using clustering algorithms.

conclusion methyl mix is an R package that identifies hyper and hypo methylated genes using a beta mixture modeling approach. methyl mix also quantifies the effect DNA methylation has on gene expression, thereby identifying transcriptionally predictive DNA methylation events. methyl mix can be used both to study single genes as in the example above or in parallel mode to build methyl mix models genome wide. methyl mix requires a large cohort to identify methylation states and capture DNA methylation heterogeneity present in a particular disease. We used methyl mix and their associated dm values to identify driver genes (), on dataset sizes of 100 samples or e more, and on more than 4000 TCGA cases across 12 tissues to identify methylation driven subgroups (). In summary, methyl mix offers a new tool to identify methylation driven genes providing a complimentary source of information to copy number and mutation spectra to identify disease driver genes.

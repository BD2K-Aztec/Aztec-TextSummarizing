Annotation of meta genomes involves comparing the individual sequence reads with a database of known sequences and assigning a unique function to each read. This is a time consuming task that is computationally intensive (though not computationally complex). Here we present a novel approach to annotate meta genomes using unique km er oligopeptide sequences from 7 to 12 amino acids long. We demonstrate that km er based annotations are faster and approach the sensitivity and precision of blastx based annotations without loosing accuracy. A last common ancestor approach was also developed to describe the members of the community. Availability and implementation: This open source application was implemented in Perl and can be accessed via a user friendly website at http://edwards.sdsu.edu/rtmg. In addition, code to access the annotation servers is available for download from http://www.theseed .org/. fig fams and km ers are available for download from ftp ftp the seed org fig fams
introduction meta genomics has revolutionized microbial ecology. The extraction, purification and sequencing steps have been trivialized by next generation sequencing approaches, and environmental samples are routinely processed from collection to DNA sequence in a matter of days (). The bottleneck in meta genomics approaches has become the analysis of the sequences. The computational comparison of sequences against all of the known proteins using blastx is limited by computational resources (). Here, we describe a novel approach to analysing meta genomic sequences using unique signature km ers that represent members of a protein family. Limited additional computational resources are required when the size of the underlying database doubles, as in the best case the search is dependent on the length of the km er. We implemented an API and Web servers to support the annotation of meta genomes using km ers

Motivation: whole exo me sequencing (WES) has opened up previously unheard of possibilities for identifying novel disease genes in Mendelian disorders, only about half of which have been elucidated to date. However, interpretation of WES data remains challenging. Results: Here, we analyze protein protein association (PPA) networks to identify candidate genes in the vicinity of genes previously implicated in a disease. The analysis, using a random walk with restart (RWR) method, is adapted to the setting of WES by developing a composite variant gene relevance score based on the rarity, location and predicted pathogenicity of variants and the RWR evaluation of genes harboring the variants. Benchmarking using known disease variants from 88 disease gene families reveals that the correct gene is ranked among the top 10 candidates in !50% of cases, a figure which we confirmed using a prospective study of disease genes identified in 2012 and PPA data produced before that date. We implement our method in a freely available Web server, exo me walker that displays a ranked list of candidates together with information on pp as frequency and predicted pathogenicity of the variants to allow quick and effective searches for candidates that are likely to reward closer investigation. Availability and implementation:

introduction the identification of causative disease genes in Mendelian disorders has contributed greatly to our understanding of gene functions and biological pathways in rare and common disease (). With the development of whole exo me sequencing (WES), the pace of identification of novel disease genes has accelerated () to the extent that groups such as the International Rare Disease Research Consortium has set out the goal of comprehensive discovery of the molecular etiologies of all rare diseases to enable molecular diagnosis for all affected individuals by the year 2020 (). Before WES, most gene discovery projects made use of linkage analysis or association studies, which typically identified genomic intervals of 0.510 cm containing up to 300 genes (). Numerous computational procedures have been developed to prioritize candidate genes in the intervals and guide DNA sequencing efforts (reviewed in). Although WES provides sequence information for the great majority of targeted exon sequences, the need for prioritization remains. An individual exo me typically contains 430 000 variants as compared with the genomic reference sequence, thousands of which are predicted to lead to nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions, alterations of conserved splice site residues or small insertions or deletions. Typical analysis strategies have relied on the characteristics of the variants, focusing on rare variants that are predicted to be pathogenic (), but even after such filtering, around $1001000 candidate disease causing variants are found in a single WES dataset, and additional methods are needed to predict which of them may have serious functional consequences and prioritize them for validation (). Because each genome harbors $100 genuine loss of function l of variants with $20 genes completely inactivated (), a purely variant based prioritization of candidate genes in WES studies will be limited in its ability to correctly identify the true disease gene. Previous gene prioritization strategies for prioritizing genes in linkage studies evaluated one or more characteristics of the y the authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the first two authors should be regarded as Joint First Authors. *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Strategies to prioritize candidate genes in exo me sequencing studies can also exploit the variant data itself in an attempt to improve prioritization of Mendelian disease genes, somatic mutations in cancer and others. A number of tools and pipelines have been developed that exploit sophisticated variant filtering strategies. The tools combine filtering steps that exclude common variants and retain only variants that are predicted likely pathogenic using tools such as mutation taster (), and then exploit sequences from multiple unrelated individuals with the sought after disease to search for genes mutated in most or all of the individuals, as well as linkage or pedigree analysis (). Recently, approaches have been introduced that combine variant impact prediction with gene prioritization. The eXtasy algorithm uses genomic data fusion to integrate variant impact prediction, haplo insufficiency prediction and phenotype specific gene prioritization (). The exo miser implements p hive PHenotypic Interpretation of Variants in exo mes an algorithm that integrates the calculation of phenotype similarity between human diseases and genetically modified mouse models, with evaluation of the variants according to allele frequency, pathogenicity and mode of inheritance (). fun seq intersects regions of the genome that are likely to be sensitive to mutations with an analysis for variants that disrupt transcription factor binding sites (). Each of these algorithms essentially seeks genes or genomic regions that are both relevant to the disease under investigation and also harbor variants likely to be pathogenic. We therefore reasoned that a key factor in exo me prioritization algorithms is to intersect the results of variant analysis with a method that can prioritize genes according to their potential relevance. The analysis of protein interaction networks has been widely used for computational analysis of human disease (). Typically, proteins do not act in isolation, but rather perform their functions cooperatively within a network of functionally related proteins. That is, groups of functionally related proteins may physically interact with one another and thereby form a 'molecular nano machine that mediates a particular biological function at cellular or systems level. A protein protein interaction (PPI) may be defined as a specific physical contact with molecular docking between proteins that occurs in cells or in a living organism in vivo (De Las Rivas and). Currently, data on 4100 000 pp is in humans are available (), derived from experimental methods including the yeast two hybrid system and tandem affinity purification. In this work, we make use of data from the search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes proteins (STRING) (), which contains not only pp is but also indirect (functional) associations derived from genomic context, high throughput experiments, conserved coexpression and text mining. We will refer to this network as the protein protein association (PPA) network. The complete set of all such interactions and associations has been referred to as the interactome, and with the increased quantity and quality of such data, analysis of the protein interactome offers an important resource for systems level understanding of cellular processes. The interactome has also become an important resource for the computational prioritization of disease genes (). The main assumption of these methods is that genes linked to diseases with similar or even identical phenotypic manifestations will in many cases code for genes that interact in specific subnetworks within the larger interactome. Therefore, lists of candidate genes can be prioritized according to the vicinity of the candidates genes within the interactome to other known members of a given disease gene family. Initial efforts to rank disease genes exploited the presence of direct interactions () or the length of the shortest path of interactions leading from a candidate gene to a known disease gene (). We have shown that a global network measure of distance in the protein protein interaction network obtained by random walk analysis, substantially improves candidate gene prioritization, including the search for direct neighbors of other disease genes (K  ohler et al., 2008). In fact, it was shown that random walk approaches outperform other gene prioritization methods (). In this work, we test the hypothesis that random walk analysis of the protein interactome can improve prioritization of candidate disease genes in exo me sequencing studies.

discussion computational candidate gene prioritization has matured into a field that has developed and benchmarked scores of algorithms that exploit and integrate complex and heterogeneous datasets including gene expression, sequence annotations, data mining, genetic sequences, functional annotations and protein protein interaction networks (). The fundamental algorithms have been improved and extended in many ways, such as including tissue specificity in the analysis of the protein interactome (). Initial computational analysis of exo me sequence data concentrated on filtering variants according to their population frequency, predicted pathogenicity and the presence of rare predicted pathogenic mutations in multiple unrelated individuals with a certain rare disease ('intersection' strategy;). However, it has become apparent that it remains difficult to identify novel disease genes or even known disease genes with WES because of the sheer number of candidate mutations; each genome is thought to harbor $100 genuine l of variants with $20 genes completely inactivated (). Therefore, filtering on variant characteristics alone is not effective in situations where a single affected individual or only a small number of individuals are being investigated. Therefore, just as positional cloning approaches were limited by the availability of large well characterized families, disease identification studies by WES are often limited by the number of individual exo me sequences available for variant intersection. For this reason, candidate gene prioritization methods have recently begun to be applied to exo me analysis. With positional cloning, prioritization would be applied to all genes located within the linkage interval; with exo me studies, prioritization is applied to all genes that harbor rare, potentially pathogenic mutations. In both settings, the number of genes may be in the hundreds. Recently, exo me prioritization methods have been introduced that exploit data fusion, phenotypic data and model organism phenotype data (). random walk analysis of protein protein interaction data has been shown to be a powerful approach to gene prioritization in the setting of positional cloning projects (K  ohler et al., 2008;). In this work, therefore, we have adapted our previous approach and tested its utility for exo me analysis illustrates the gene prioritization procedure in the case of d dost and DPM2, components of the oligos acc h aryl transferase complex that transfers a glycan chain to nascent proteins. Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are inherited AR diseases that impair n glycosylation and previously identified CDG disease genes were used to prioritize candidate genes including d dost and DPM2 in the simulations summarized in. It can be seen that d dost has only two direct interactions with CDG seed genes and is at some distance from the others, leading to it only being ranked 23rd. However, DPM2 has multiple direct and second degree interactions with CDG genes leading to it being ranked as the top ranked candidate in simulations. In contrast, other genes did not achieve a high rank. For instance, TMEM5, mutations which were shown to be a cause of type A muscular dystrophy dystroglycan o pathy (), was placed at rank 19 by our method. This gene has only one high confidence association in the STRING database, with PLAU (plasminogen activator, urokinase), which itself has 10 high confidence associations to other genes, none of which is related to type A muscular dystrophy dystroglycan o pathy. Therefore, although mutations in TMEM5 cause the same disease as mutations in the other genes of this family (POMGNT1, POMGNT2, is pd fk tn POMT1, POMT2, fkr p LARGE), there is little functional similarity reflecting this in STRING. Thus, although PPA analysis offers an effective way of prioritizing disease genes in many cases, there are disease genes that do not show a high random walk score. In cases where the causative gene does not interact with previous members of the disease gene family, or for diseases where there are no previously known genes, other approaches will have to be considered. We recently described an approach, exo miser that uses phenotype comparisons with model organism data to inform on candidacy (). eXtasy is another recently published solution that uses phenotype comparisons along with consideration of many other data types (). To contrast and compare these different approaches we applied them to the same set of recently solved cases and report the performance in. Note that eXtasy does not perform any variant filtering, and so, to allow a fair comparison we used VCF files that had already been filtered in the same way as for the exo me walker benchmarking. Three of the diseases currently have no phenotype annotations available and are therefore not runnable through eXtasy or particularly amenable to exo miser prioritization. eXtasy can only inform on non-synonymous variants and four of the cases involve a small deletion, which again was not assessable. Finally, for two of the cases, eXtasy removed the causative variant during analysis, so no final ranking was possible. For 2 of the 10 remaining cases, exo miser and eXtasy performed better than exo me walker with exo me walker outperforming them in the other cases. KLHL3 is a good example where there is minimal evidence for interactions with previously implicated genes but where use of phenotype data allowed identification of the causative variant as the top or second best hit using eXtasy or exo miser respectively.

conclusion we have implemented our method in a freely available Web server called exo me walker. Users can upload a VCF file and choose one of 243 phenotypic series or enter their own disease gene family in the form of a list of Entrez Gene identifiers. These genes may already be known to be associated with the disease or be members of a pathway suspected of being disrupted in the disease or just candidates from in house knowledge. If the VCF file contains multiple samples, exo me walker will assume that all samples are from the same family and will ask the user to upload a pedigree (PED) file. It will then perform pedigree filtering on the genes and variants represented in the VCF file using the jan novar library (). It will subsequently rank the candidate genes and return a list of candidates together with information about the genes. Importantly, it will show all first and second degree interactions with the seed genes, allowing users to quickly eyeball candidate lists to determine if there are genes with multiple functional associations with the seed genes that would reward closer inspection. exo me sequencing remains a difficult endeavor, and large scale exo me sequencing studies for the identification of Mendelian disease causing genes have reported success rates around 2035% (). Therefore, it is not realistically to be expected that a prioritization method will place the correct gene in the first place, or first few places, in all cases. An advantage of the methodology presented here is that exo me walker quickly shows whether there are candidate genes with both predicted pathogenic variants and multiple functional associations with other genes in the same disease gene family. If this is not the case, users may wish to explore phenotype based () or genomic data fusion () prioritization of exo me data, or if possible sequence additional family samples to enable linkage filtering (R  odels per ger et al., 2011; Smith et al., 2011), or sequence additional unrelated individuals for intersection based () approaches.

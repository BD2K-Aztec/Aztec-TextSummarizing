Non-coding RNA (ncRNA) PROfiling in small RNA srna seq nc pro seq is a stand-alone, comprehensive and flexible ncRNA analysis pipeline. It can interrogate and perform detailed profiling analysis on srn as derived from annotated non-coding regions in mir base rf am and RepeatMasker, as well as specific regions defined by users. The nc pro seq pipeline performs both gene based and family based analyses of srn as. It also has a module to identify regions significantly enriched with short reads, which can not be classified under known ncRNA families, thus enabling the discovery of previously unknown ncrna or small interfering RNA sirna producing regions. The nc pro seq pipeline supports input read sequences in fast q fast a and color space format, as well as alignment results in BAM format, meaning that sRNA raw data from the three current major platforms (Roche-454, illumina solexa and Life technologies solid can be analyzed with this pipeline. The nc pro seq pipeline can be used to analyze read and alignment data, based on any sequenced genome, including mammals and plants.

introduction research on small non-coding RNAs nc rnas has advanced tremendously over recent years as a consequence of the widespread adoption of small RNA srna seq which has helped to characterize members of known sRNA families, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and piwi interacting RNA pirn a (;). In addition, analysis of srna seq data has led to the identification of several novel small ncRNA families, including heterochromatic sRNA (), small nucleolar RNA snorna derived RNAs sd rnas (), transfer RNA trna derived RNA fragments tr fs (), transcription initiation RNAs ti rnas splice site RNAs spl i rnas () and enhancer RNAs ern as (). Given that most of the genome is transcribed (), further small ncRNA families are still probably hidden in un an no ated regions, awaiting detailed exploration. Despite this, most of the existing srna seq analysis tools only focus on miRNAs (), whereas some other tools are applicable to the prediction of special or general siRNA loci (). As far as we are aware, only two approaches seq cluster () and DARIO ()are currently available for annotating and classifying whole srna seq data in an unbiased way. seq cluster not only carefully groups non mirna reads into units but also provides classification and annotation of units rnas. DARIO web server contains both sRNA annotation and prediction engines, but can not be used to process repeat associated srn as owing to the size limitation of data submission. Furthermore, these tools perform mostly gene based analyses, providing information about read mapping in each ncRNA gene region. However, to systematically investigate small ncRNA species in a given annotation family (i.e. miRNA, other srn as families or repeats families), profiling analyses, which refers to detailed descriptions of diverse features of read distribution in annotation families, are necessary. The ncRNA PROfiling in srna seq nc pro seq pipeline circumvents these limitations by providing detailed information on all types of small nc rnas and identifying unannotated regions that are significantly enriched in matching srn as. *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

conclusion the nc pro seq pipeline provides a comprehensive approach for the annotation and prediction of small nc rnas in srna seq data. The pipeline can analyse different annotation families rather than just focusing on miRNAs. Various sequence and alignment inputs from different metazoan and plant genomes are supported. The great advantage of the pipeline over others is the capacity to perform profiling analyses of annotation families, which is critically important to investigate known small ncRNA families and to define novel small ncRNA families. The significant regions predicted in the pipeline can be further interpreted to identify novel miRNA loci and siRNA clusters.

MOCAT2 is a software pipeline for meta genomic sequence assembly and gene prediction with novel features for taxonomic and functional abundance profiling. The automated generation and efficient annotation of non-redundant reference catalogs by propagating pre-computed assignments from 18 databases covering various functional categories allows for fast and comprehensive functional characterization of meta genomes. Availability and Implementation: MOCAT2 is implemented in Perl 5 and Python 2.7, designed for 64-bit UNIX systems and offers support for high performance computer usage via LSF, PBS or SGE queuing systems; source code is freely available under the GPL3 license at

introduction meta genomics has enabled large scale studies investigating the structure, function and diversity of microbial communities. The computational analysis of samples, often totaling many giga bases of sequence data, usually involves mapping reads to taxonomic and functional reference databases (which may require the de novo assembly of predicted genes), and subsequent abundance profiling. Whereas taxonomic profiling methodology has matured recently (), functional profiling still remains challenging due to the difficulties in assigning functions to millions of reads from meta genomes. Moreover, current meta genomic pipelines () for functional annotation and or profiling mainly implement metabolic pathway or protein domain databases () such as KEGG (), SEED () or Pfam (). Here, we present meta genomic analysis toolkit version 2 (MOCAT2), which was developed to enable functional profiling of meta genomes based on a much wider range and diversity of functional gene annotations. Its features are compared to existing tools in Supplementary Table S1.

We present a new web server called TAPIR, designed for the prediction of plant microRNA targets. The server offers the possibility to search for plant miRNA targets using a fast and a precise algorithm. The precise option is much slower but guarantees to find less perfectly paired mirna target duplexes. Furthermore, the precise option allows the prediction of target mimics, which are characterized by a mirna target duplex having a large loop, making them undetectable by traditional tools.

introduction micrornas (miRNAs) constitute a prominent class of small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. In plants, miRNAs are the key regulators involved in various developmental, stress and cellular responses (). With the rise of next generation sequencing data, new miRNAs are uncovered in various plant genomes at a rapid pace. One of the major challenges is then to determine their function, and a crucial step towards this goal is the identification of the miRNAs targets. Candidate targets can be identified through base pair complementarity of the miRNA sequence to mRNA sequences (). The mirna mrna duplexes were originally thought to have few mismatches, GU pairs and bulges, but there is now increasing evidence that less perfect hybridizations might also be functional, leading in some cases to translational repression rather than cleavage of the target mRNA (). Recent reports have also revealed the existence in plants of a phenomenon called miRNA target mimicry, where mirna mrna duplexes with a large bulge around the cleavage site actually sequester miRNAs, resulting in an inhibition of the miRNA activity (). We have designed and implemented TAPIR, a novel web server dedicated to the prediction of plant miRNAs, including miRNA target mimics. * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Motivation: The availability of large scale curated protein interaction datasets has given rise to the opportunity to investigate higher level organization and modularity within the protein protein interaction (PPI) network using graph theoretic analysis. Despite the recent progress, systems level analysis of high throughput pp is remains a daunting task because of the amount of data they present. In this article, we propose a novel PPI network decomposition algorithm called FACETS in order to make sense of the deluge of interaction data using Gene Ontology (GO) annotations. FACETS finds not just a single functional decomposition of the PPI network, but a multi-faceted atlas of functional decompositions that portray alternative perspectives of the functional landscape of the underlying PPI network. Each facet in the atlas represents a distinct interpretation of how the network can be functionally decomposed and organized. Our algorithm maximizes interpretative value of the atlas by optimizing interface t orthogonality and intra facet cluster modularity. Results: We tested our algorithm on the global networks from IntAct, and compared it with gold standard datasets from MIPS and KEGG. We demonstrated the performance of FACETS. We also performed a case study that illustrates the utility of our approach. Contact:

introduction the massive amount of biological interaction datasets presents the opportunity to study higher order organization and modularity of interaction networks. high throughput interaction experiments, however, introduce new challenges to visualization and analysis of biological interaction data. A common thread that runs through high throughput generated data is information overload, i.e. the explosion of data that makes intuitive and meaningful functional analysis difficult, even overwhelming. In case of protein protein interaction (PPI) data, decomposing the network into functional modules is often the key step to understanding the overall picture of the functional relationships that underlie the data. Consequently, graph clustering methods that decompose PPI networks into their functional constituents are increasingly pertinent (). In general, graph clustering algorithms discover regions of dense connectivity that represent protein complexes or functionally coherent processes (). Unfortunately, these methods output only a single optimal functional decomposition of the PPI network. Consequently, a PPI network can only be decomposed and viewed from a single perspective, whereas in reality there are often multiple different perspectives (decompositions) associated with the functional organization of the underlying network, all of which are distinct and equally valid. We refer to each of these decompositions as a facet because they visualize the organization of a PPI network from a unique view, providing a distinct interpretation of the organization of the underlying network. For example, consider the toy transcriptional regulatory network depicted in. A typical decomposition, based on an existing graph clustering technique (e.g. m code in), identifies dense regions of the network, which correspond to the decomposition of protein complexes as shown in Facet 1. However, this network can also be viewed from other different perspectives. For instance, it can be organized by the types of signaling pathways involved in it (Facet 2). Notice that the decomposition from this perspective is markedly different from the complex based decomposition. Furthermore, different proteins in the network may undergo various modifications such as acetylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Hence, yet another way to decompose the network is by their modification effects as depicted in Facet 3. Clearly, in larger real world networks the possibility of uncovering multiple, distinct functional decompositions are real. At first glance, it may seem that we can tune the clustering parameters of existing graph clustering techniques in order to generate multiple facets or decompositions. Unfortunately, such tuning only generates an exponential number of slightly perturbed decompositions with incremental differences (see Supplementary Material). In other words, such strategy does not generate functionally unique decompositions. In contrast, it is imperative to ensure that the decompositions or facets are distinctive, i.e. they are maximally different from each other. This is because every facet should provide a fresh and informative perspective to the organization of the network, rather than providing just incremental differences with respect to other facets. *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

We propose a novel algorithm called FACETS that discovers an atlas of functionally unique decompositions from a PPI network, portraying alternative views of the functional landscape of the network (detailed in Section 2). Each decomposition or facet represents a distinct interpretation of how the network can be functionally decomposed and organized. Since a key objective is to obtain n unique facets that are informative and orthogonal (We use the term orthogonal to describe the idea of distinctive clusters, rather than its precise mathematical meaning.), our algorithm maximizes interpretative value of the atlas by optimizing intra facet cluster modularity and interface t orthogonality. intra facet cluster modularity captures the aim of decomposing a PPI network G based on a particular functional and or structural view. For instance, based on complexes and localized structures, G can be decomposed into protein complexes. If we consider regulatory processes as a functional concept, then G can be decomposed into signaling and regulation pathways, an entirely different decomposition. interface t orthogonality, on the other hand, demands that each of the n facets are structurally distinctive and functionally apart from each other. We propose a novel objective function that models these intuitions and FACETS exploit it to discover a set of distinct facets. Specifically, we exploit both the PPI graph structure and the rich functional information provided by Gene Ontology (GO) annotations to guide facets construction. In Section 3 we evaluate the performance of FACETS on real world PPI datasets. We also compare facets generated decompositions against several gold standard datasets. We demonstrate its superiority over tested graph clustering methods. We illustrate the robustness of FACETS against noise. Finally, we conduct a case study to illustrate how multi-faceted decompositions identified multiple organization maps of the human autophagy system (). Related work. Multi-view clustering is a poorly studied problem in the data mining community (). Still, there are several works that have focused on multi-view clusterings in image and text mining domain (). One approach projects data into an alternative subspace (). Another approach generates alternative clustering through the use of must link and can not link constraints (). In meta clustering (), a large number of clusters are generated and clusters which are truly different are selected. All of the aforementioned approaches, however, assume data points in the vector space that allow the notion of metric distances in a Euclidean geometry. On the other hand, our problem demands a multi-view clustering methodology on attributed graphs, which requires a graph clustering paradigm on both structure and annotation. To the best of our knowledge, multi-view clustering paradigm has not been applied in clustering biological networks to identify pertinent functional modules from multiple perspectives. Ensemble clustering methods generate an ensemble of near optimal decompositions (). These methods have been used to increase the quality and confidence of the decomposition and understand network dynamics. The near optimal decompositions generated, however, have no notion of the orthogonality that this work is seeking. Instead, ensemble clusterings create a large number of perturbed solutions, making them unsuitable as an atlas of functionally distinct decompositions. For instance, in (), a small network of 32 nodes generated at least 82 permutations of clusterings.

conclusion in this article, we propose FACETS, a data driven and generic algorithm for generating multi-faceted functional decompositions of a PPI network, providing multiple perspectives of the functional organization landscape of the network. Our experimental validation with real world PPI networks demonstrates effectiveness of FACETS in generating functionally distinctive facets. As future work, we intend to extend FACETS to evaluate both annotated and unannotated regions of the PPI network. Conflict of Interest: none declared.

Computational diagnosis of amino acid variants in the human exo me is the first step in assessing the disruptive impacts of non-synonymous single nucleotide variants nss nvs on human health and disease. The Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis software with mutational diagnosis mega md is a suite of tools developed to forecast the deleterious ness of nss nvs using multiple methods and to explore nss nvs in the context of the variability permitted in the long term evolution of the affected position. In its graphical interface for use on desktops, it enables interactive computational diagnosis and evolutionary exploration of nss nvs. As a web service, mega md is suitable for diagnosing variants on an exo me scale. The mega md suite intends to serve the needs for conducting low and high throughput analysis of nss nvs in diverse applications.

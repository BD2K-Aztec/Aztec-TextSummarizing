We present the first public release of our proteo genomic annotation pipeline. We have previously used our original unreleased implementation to improve the annotation of 46 diverse prokaryotic genomes by discovering novel genes, post-translational modifications and correcting the erroneous annotations by analyzing proteomic mass spectrometry data. This public version has been redesigned to run in a wide range of parallel Linux computing environments and provided with the automated configuration, build and testing facilities for easy deployment and portability. Availability and implementation: Source code is freely available from https://bitbucket.org/andreyto/proteogenomics under GPL license. It is implemented in Python and Cþþ. It bundles the make flow engine to execute the workflows.

introduction our pipeline is a tool for improving the existing genomic annotations from available proteomics mass spectrometry data. As most genome annotation pipelines consist of automated gene finding, they lack experimental validation of primary structure (), having to rely on DNA centric sources of data such as sequence homology, transcriptome mapping, codon frequency, etc. By incorporating the orthogonal set of data, proteo genomics is able to discover novel genes, post-translational modifications and correct the erroneous primary sequence annotations. The protocol and the large scale application of our original pipeline to 46 taxonomically diverse genomes were reported in. The implementation was tightly coupled with the internal computation services framework (VICS) at the J. Craig Venter Institute jc vi. VICS has never been deployed outside of the jc vi and the pipeline itself required manual configuration and building by the developers. It could only use Sun Grid Engine (SGE) batch queuing system configured for high throughput computing (HTC) mode in which large numbers of serial jobs could be efficiently scheduled on a compute cluster. For these reasons, the original pipeline has not been made public. To create the first open source release presented here, we have redesigned the pipeline to run in a wide range of parallel Linux computing environments: high performance computing (HPC) clusters, which are set up to efficiently schedule only large (100s of cores) parallel Message Passing Interface (MPI) jobs under a control of batch queuing system such as Sun Grid Engine (SGE) and its clones, Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management slur m or Portable Batch System pbs torque. Our primary targets for this use case were compute clusters of x sede (https://www.xsede.org/), the federation of supercomputers supported by the US National Science Foundation. x sede allocates its resources to outside researchers through a peer reviewed proposal system. The biologists will be able to use our software on this major computational resource. high throughput computing (HTC) clusters widely used as local bioinformatics computing resources. These clusters are configured to efficiently schedule large numbers of serial jobs under a control of batch queuing system. A single multi-core workstation without a batch queuing system (including an extreme case of single core machine). The volume of computations in proteo genomics is relatively high, with 100 CPU hours for a typical bacterial genome. Our pipeline performs such annotation in 3 h of wall clock time on HTC cluster. We have now designed a fully automated installation procedure preconfigured for several types of specific target systems and easily adaptable to others through editing of a few configuration files. Although several other proteo genomic packages () have been developed in recent years, they were designed for execution on a single workstation. None of the other publications matched the breadth of application reported for our pipeline in. The output files from that study are available at (http://omics. pnl gov pgp overview php. The contributed RefSeq updates can be seen in the Genbank flat files (.gbk) of the corresponding genomes at the NCBI wherever the proteomics data are listed *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

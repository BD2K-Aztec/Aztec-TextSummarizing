Bimodal patterns of expression have recently been shown to be useful not only in prioritizing genes that distinguish phenotypes, but also in prioritizing network models that correlate with proteomic evidence. In particular, subgroups of strongly coexpressed gene pairs result in an increased variance of the correlation distribution. This variance, a measure of association between sets of genes (or proteins), can be summarized as the bi modality of coexpression (BiC). We developed an online tool to calculate the BiC for user defined gene lists and associated mRNA expression data.

introduction recently a number of techniques have emerged to identify subsets of genes exhibiting bimodal patterns of gene expression, as these distinguishing features are highly suggestive of molecular switches (). While many of these approaches attempt to identify the modes of expression represented by a single gene with respect to two phenotypes (), the modes of expression among sets of genes can also be informative and can be evidenced by bimodal patterns of coexpression. Bimodal coexpression patterns arise among biologically related gene sets whose members have stronger mRNA correlations, ||, with each other than with unrelated genes. As these highly related gene sets will have both large positive and large negative values of , their correlation pattern has greater variance than the correlation distribution of unrelated gene sets (which is centered around  = 0), and took advantage of this fact to calculate a property which they call the bi modality of Coexpression' (BiC). Using a non-parametric approach, they have previously shown that the BiC can be useful in evaluating the strength of association between a hypothetical signaling network and an experimentally observed set of proteomic targets. In this context, a high degree of coexpression also suggests which genes

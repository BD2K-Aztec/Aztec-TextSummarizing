introduction rna abundance, as the results of active gene expression, affects cell differentiation and tissue development (). As such, it provides a snapshot of the undergoing biological process within certain cells or a tissue. Except for house-keeping genes, the expressions of a large number of genes vary from tissue to tissue, and some may only be expressed in a particular tissue or a certain cell type (). The regulation of tissue specific expression is a complex process in which a gene's enhancer plays a key role regulating gene expressions via DNA methylation (Ong and V C The Author 2015.

Model Quality Assessment Programs mq aps are used to predict the quality of modeled protein structures. These usually use two approaches: methods using consensus of many alternative models and methods requiring only a single model to do its prediction. The consensus methods are useful to improve overall accuracy; however , they frequently fail to pick out the best possible model and can not be used to generate and score new structures. single model methods, on the other hand, do not have these inherent shortcomings and can be used to both sample new structures and improve existing consensus methods. Here, we present pro qm resample a membrane protein specific single model m qap that couples side chain resam-pling with m qap re scoring by pro qm to improve model selection. The side chain resampling is able to improve side chain packing for 96% of all models, and improve model selection by 24% as measured by the sum of the Z-score for the first ranked model (from 25.0 to 31.1), even better than the state of the art consensus method p cons. The improved model selection can be attributed to the improved side chain quality, which enables the m qap to rescue good backbone models with poor side chain packing.

introduction protein structure modeling represents a fundamental challenge in structural bioinformatics and is crucial for a detailed understanding of the structure and biological function of molecules. It can be used to guide and explain experiments, as well as for prediction of proteins whose structure, in particular for membrane proteins, for the most part is unknown ($0.5% membrane protein in the Protein Data Bank $25% in most genomes). A common technique in structure modeling is to generate many alternative models and use a Model Quality Assessment Program m qap to select the best model. Alternatively, an m qap can also be used to assess the absolute quality of a single model, i.e. a measure that is related to similarity to true native structure (). pro qm () is an m qap that uses a support vector machine to predict the quality of a membrane protein model by combining structural and sequence based features calculated from the model. In its original implementation, external programs were used to calculate features, e.g. PSI-BLAST (), psi pred (), n access (Hubbard and), Stride (), pro q res (), z pred (), top cons (), mp rap iller gard and svm light (). These dependencies made it difficult to distribute the program, run large batches and use it in conformational sampling. Therefore, pro qm has only been available as a web server for small scale use. To overcome these issues, pro qm was incorporated as scoring function in the Rosetta modeling framework. This gives in one hand full access to the modeling machinery within Rosetta and allows for easy integration with any Rosetta protocol. In particular, pro qm resample uses the repack protocol to sample side chain conformations followed by re scoring using pro qm to improve model selection.

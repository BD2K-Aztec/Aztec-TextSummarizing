high throughput gene expression microarrays are currently the most efficient method for transcriptome wide expression analyses. Consequently, gene expression data available through public repositories have largely been obtained from microarray experiments. However, the metadata associated with many publicly available expression microarray datasets often lacks sample sex information, therefore limiting the reuse of these data in new analyses or larger meta analyses where the effect of sex is to be considered. Here, we present the mass ir package, which provides a method for researchers to predict the sex of samples in microarray datasets. Using information from microarray probes representing Y chromosome genes, this package implements unsupervised clustering methods to classify samples into male and female groups, providing an efficient way to identify or confirm the sex of samples in mammalian microarray datasets. Availability and implementation: mass ir is implemented as a Bioconductor package in R. The package and the vignette can be downloaded at bioconductor org and are provided under a GPL-2

introduction for more than a decade, high throughput microarray experiments have been generating large volumes of genome wide expression data, and the reporting requirements of many journals have seen that much of these data are made publicly available. Given the substantial value of these accumulated datasets, it is becoming increasingly common to reuse gene expression data to validate new findings or to pose new biological questions.

conclusion to our knowledge, this is the only available software package for predicting the sex of samples in gene expression microarray datasets. This easily implemented method opens the door to both prospective and retrospective gene expression analyses that wish to consider the effect of sex on gene expression.

Two methods to add unaligned sequences into an existing multiple sequence alignment have been implemented as the -add and add fragments options in the maff t package. The former option is a basic one and applicable only to full length sequences, whereas the latter option is applicable even when the unaligned sequences are short and fragmentary. These methods internally infer the phylogenetic relationship among the sequences in the existing alignment and the phylogenetic positions of unaligned sequences. Benchmarks based on two independent simulations consistently suggest that the add fragments option outperforms recent methods , pa para and PAGAN, in accuracy for difficult problems and that these three methods appropriately handle easy problems.

We present rnase q gui R package, a graphical user interface (GUI) for the identification of differentially expressed genes across multiple biological conditions. This R package includes some well known rnase q tools, available at www bioconductor org. rnase q gui package is not just a collection of some known methods and functions, but it is designed to guide the user during the entire analysis process. rnase q gui package is mainly addressed to those users who have little experience with command line software. Therefore, thanks to rnase q gui they can conduct analogous analyses using this simple graphical interface. Moreover, rnase q gui is also helpful for those who are expert r users because it speeds up the usage of the included rnase q methods drastically. Availability and implementation: rnase q gui package needs the RGTK2 graphical library to run.

introduction there is a plethora of rnase q data analysis tools available to study the difference of the gene expression across multiple biological conditions; see sones on and de lorenzi (2013) for a review. Generally, a complete analysis requires carrying out several steps, using different methods and comparing their outputs to obtain more reliable and less biased results. rnase q gui is a tool that facilitates and speeds up the exploration of the rnase q data, the usage of several rnase q methods and the comparison of different results. Moreover, rnase q gui is a modular software. This gives the user the possibility to customize the software for a specific type of study.

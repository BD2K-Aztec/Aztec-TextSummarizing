The Web Ontology Language (OWL) provides a sophisticated language for building complex domain ontologies and is widely used in bio ontologies such as the Gene Ontology. The Proté go wl ontology editing tool provides a query facility that allows composition and execution of queries with the human readable Manchester OWL syntax, with syntax checking and entity label lookup. No equivalent query facility such as the Proté gé Description Logics (DL) query yet exists in web form. However, many users interact with bio ontologies such as chemical entities of biological interest and the Gene Ontology using their online Web sites, within which dl based querying function-ality is not available. To address this gap, we introduce the on to query web based query utility. Availability and implementation: The source code for this implementation together with instructions for installation is available at http://github.com/IlincaTudose/OntoQuery. on to query software is fully compatible with all owl based ontologies and is available for download (CC-0 license). The ChEBI installation, ChEBI on to query is available at

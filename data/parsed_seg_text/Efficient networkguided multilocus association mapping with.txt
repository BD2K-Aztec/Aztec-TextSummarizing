Motivation: As an increasing number of genome wide association studies reveal the limitations of the attempt to explain phenotypic heritability by single genetic loci, there is a recent focus on associating complex phenotypes with sets of genetic loci. Although several methods for multi-locus mapping have been proposed, it is often unclear how to relate the detected loci to the growing knowledge about gene pathways and networks. The few methods that take biological pathways or networks into account are either restricted to investigating a limited number of predetermined sets of loci or do not scale to genome wide settings. Results: We present SConES, a new efficient method to discover sets of genetic loci that are maximally associated with a phenotype while being connected in an underlying network. Our approach is based on a minimum cut reformulation of the problem of selecting features under sparsity and connectivity constraints, which can be solved exactly and rapidly. SConES outperforms state of the art competitors in terms of runtime, scales to hundreds of thousands of genetic loci and exhibits higher power in detecting causal SNPs in simulation studies than other methods. On flowering time phenotypes and genotypes from Arabidopsis thaliana, SConES detects loci that enable accurate phenotype prediction and that are supported by the literature.

introduction twin and family pedigree studies make it possible to estimate the heritability of observed traits, that is to say the amount of their variability that can be attributed to genetic differences. In the past few years, genome wide association studies g was in which several hundreds of thousands to millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are assayed in up to thousands of individuals, have made it possible to identify hundreds of genetic variants associated with complex phenotypes (). Unfortunately, although studies associating single SNPs with phenotypic outcomes have become standard, they often fail to explain much of the heritability of complex traits (). Investigating the joint effects of multiple loci by mapping sets of genetic variants to the phenotype has the potential to help explain part of this missing heritability (). Although efficient multiple linear regression approaches () make the detection of such multivariate associations possible, they often remain limited in power and hard to interpret. Incorporating biological knowledge into these approaches could help boosting their power and interpretability. However, current methods are limited to pre defining a reasonable number of candidate sets to investigate (), for instance by relying on gene pathways. They consequently run the risk of missing biologically relevant loci that have not been included in the candidate sets. This risk is made even likelier by the incomplete state of our current biological knowledge. For this reason, our goal here is to use prior knowledge in a more flexible way. We propose to use a biological network, defined between SNPs, to guide a multi-locus mapping approach that is both efficient to compute and biologically meaningful: We aim to find a set of SNPs that (i) are maximally associated with a given phenotype and (ii) tend to be connected in a given biological network. In addition, this set must be computed efficiently on genome wide data. In this article, we assume an additive model to characterize multi-locus association. The network constraint stems from the assumption that SNPs influencing the same phenotype are biologically linked. However, the diversity of the type of relationships that this can encompass, together with the current incompleteness of biological knowledge, makes providing a network in which all the relevant connections are present unlikely. For this reason, although we want to encourage the SNPs to form a subnetwork of the network, we also do not want to enforce that they must form a single connected component. Finally, we stress that the method must scale to networks of hundreds of thousands or millions of nodes. Approaches by or Li and developed to analyze gene networks containing hundreds of nodes do therefore not apply. Although our method can be applied to any network between genetic markers, we explore three special types of networks ():GS network: SNPs adjacent on the genomic sequence (GS) are linked together. In this setting, we aim at recovering subsequences of the genomic sequence that correlate with the phenotype. *To whom correspondence should be addressed.  The Author 2013.

Usually, a SNP is considered to belong to a gene if it is either located inside said gene or within a predefined distance of this gene. In this setting, we aim more particularly at recovering genes that correlate with the phenotype. GI (gene interaction) network: SNPs are connected as in the GM network described earlier in the text. In addition, supposing we have a gene gene interaction network (derived, for example, from protein protein interaction data or gene expression correlations), SNPs belonging to two genes connected in the gene network are linked together. In this setting, we aim at recovering potential pathways that explain the phenotype. Our task is a feature selection problem in a graph structured feature space, where the features are the SNPs, and the selection criterion should be related to their association with the phenotype considered. Our problem is different from subgraph selection problems such as those encountered in chemo informatics where each object is a graph and each feature is a subgraph of its own (). Several approaches have already been developed for selecting graph structured features. A number of them (Le) only use the graph over the features to build the learners evaluating their relevance, but do not enforce that the selected features should follow this underlying structure. Indeed, they can be applied to settings where the features connectivity varies across examples, whereas here, all individuals share the same network. The overlapping group Lasso () is a sparse linear model designed to select features that belong to the union of a small number of predefined groups. If a graph over the features is given, defining those groups as all pairs of features connected by an edge or as all linear subgraphs of a given size yields the so called graph Lasso. A similar approach is taken by: their structured sparsity penalty encourages selecting a small number of base blocks, where blocks are sets of features defined so as to match the structure of the problem. In the case of a graph induced structure, blocks are defined as small connected components of that graph. As shown in, the overlapping group Lasso aforementioned is a relaxation of this binary problem. As the number of linear subgraphs or connected components of a given size grows exponentially with the number of nodes of the graph, which can reach millions in the case of whole genome SNP data, only the edge based version of the graph Lasso can be applied to our problem. It is however unclear whether it is sufficient to capture long range connections between graph nodes. Li and Li (2008) propose a network constrained version of the Lasso that imposes the type of graph connectivity we deem desirable. However, their approach has been developed with networks of genes (rather than of SNPs) in mind and does not scale easily to the datasets we envision. Indeed, the implementation they propose relies on a singular value decomposition of the Laplacian of the network, which is intensive to compute and can not be stored in memory also searched subnetworks of protein protein interaction networks that are maximally associated with a phenotype; however, their greedy approach requires fixing beforehand a (necessarily small) upper limit on the size of the subnetworks considered. In the case of directed acyclic graphs, mair al and Yu (2011) propose a minimum flow formulation that makes it possible to use for groups (or blocks) the set of all paths of the network. Unfortunately, the generalization to undirected graphs with cycles, such as the SNP networks we consider, requires randomly assigning directions to edges and pruning those in cycles without any biological justification. Although this can work reasonably well in practice (), this is akin to artificially removing more than half of the network connections without any biological justification. In what follows, we formulate the network guided SNP selection problem as a minimum cut problem on a graph derived from the SNP network in Section 2 and evaluate the performance of our solution both in simulations and on actual Arabidopsis thaliana data in Section 3.

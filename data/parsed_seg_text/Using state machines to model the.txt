A major player is Ion Torrent, a pyrosequencing like technology which produces flow grams – sequences of incorporation values – which are converted into nucleotide sequences by a base calling algorithm. Because of its exploitation of ubiquitous semiconductor technology and innovation in chemistry, Ion Torrent has been gaining popularity since its debut in 2011. Despite the advantages, however, Ion Torrent read accuracy remains a significant concern. Results: We present flow gram fixer a new algorithm for converting flow grams into reads. Our key observation is that the incorporation signals of neighboring flows, even after normalization and phase correction , carry considerable mutual information and are important in making the correct base call. We therefore propose that base calling of flow grams should be done on a read wide level, rather than one flow at a time. We show that this can be done in linear time by combining a state machine with a Viterbi algorithm to find the nucleotide sequence that maximizes the likelihood of the observed flow gram. flow gram fixer is applicable to any flow gram based sequencing platform. We demonstrate flow gram fixers superior performance on Ion Torrent Escherichia coli data, with a 4.8% improvement in the number of high quality mapped reads and a 7.1% improvement in the number of uniquely mappable reads.

introduction the importance of fast and affordable DNA sequencing methods for current day life sciences, medicine and biotechnology is hard to over state. Ion Torrent's semiconductor sequencing technology, as implemented in its Personal Genome Machine (PGM), has been gaining popularity as a fast and affordable sequencing platform since it's debut in 2011 (). Semiconductor sequencing has several advantages compared with other high throughput sequencing platforms, including lack of optics, use of natural, unmodified dNTP molecules and exploitation of ubiquitous semiconductor technology. These advances make Ion Torrent a serious player in the sequencer market, providing reads several hundred bases long and reducing sequencing costs (). Ion Torrent is a pyrosequencing like platform, similar to 454. In every sequencing step, or flow, the chip is washed over with a specific nucleotide. The nucleotide in the flow is incorporated by all consecutive complementary nucleotides 'hanging' at the end of each template this is called incorporation. Each incorporation releases an ion, so that the change in pH level indicates whether incorporation occurred and, if so, the number of consecutive bases incorporated. The nucleotide that is washed during each flow is pre-determined and is composed from several repetitions of a shorter sequence of nucleotides known as the 'wash cycle'. The default wash cycle for 454 is 4 nt long: tac g whereas Ion Torrent's PGM uses a more complicated wash cycle that is 32 nt long. The resulting read is then specified in terms of a flow grama sequence of incorporation values, one for each flow gives an overview of the process. Despite its advantages, Ion Torrent read accuracy remains a significant concern. Errors are produced during base calling a process by which the noisy signal from the sequencer is converted into a sequence of nucleotides. base calling errors can especially pose challenges for re-sequencing projects, where they can be confused with SNPs. In fact, a recent comparative study found that Ion Torrent's PGM still suffers from high false positive rates in SNP calling, relative to Illumina data (). There is a large body of work on base calling algorithms see for a survey], and there have been several techniques developed specifically for pyrosequencing data (). These techniques have mostly focused on correcting 454's well documented () errors in long homopolymer runs or alignment of their flow grams. However, there has been little work done in correcting base calling errors in Ion Torrent data. Ion Torrent's base calling algorithm, after performing phase correction and normalizing to handle signal decay, simply translates the rounded values of each flow into the corresponding number of consecutive nucleotides. In essence, it is a memoryless algorithm that makes a call for each flow independent of information from previous or following flows. Our key observation is that the signals of neighboring flows carry considerable mutual information and are important in making the correct base call. We propose that base calling of flow grams should be done on a read wide level, rather than one flow at a time. To this end, we design a linear time method that combines a state machine with a Viterbi algorithm to find the nucleotide sequence that maximizes the likelihood of the observed flow gram. Our algorithm is applicable to any flow gram based sequencing platform and is implemented in a publicly available tool called flow gram fixer. We demonstrate flow gram fixers superior performance on Ion Torrent Escherichia coli data, with a 4.8% improvement in the *To whom correspondence should be addressed.  The Author 2013.

discussion we have focused on developing a general inference framework without making it overly reliant on the current intricacies of Ion Torrent's platform. However, there are several possible extensions that, although making the approach less robust to technology changes, could improve its performance on to days datasets. We discuss several such ideas later in the text. Our noise model relies on a intercept and trend model for the standard deviation (SD) parameter. One might suggest richer models, including more complicated dependency of the SD on the flow index, dependency of the SD on the number of incorporated nucleotides and a dependency on the position along the basic 32-nt wash cycle. We briefly experimented with these ideas and were not able to find a richer model that improved the results while maintaining a reasonable running time. However, exploring these ideas further seems worthwhile. Additionally, we suggest that additional accuracy gains might be gained by adding a spatial structure to the noise model, as nearby wells experience similar artifacts during the sequencing process.

Error rate difference between the rounding method and flow gram fixer (baseline error rate  flow gram fixer error rate). The average difference of error rate grows as the sequencing process progresses, as expected because of the noisier signal obtained at later flows. Although at some flows, the error rate decreases by as much as 3.4%, at other flows the error rate actually increases. Interestingly, the error rate difference also displays a dependency on the position in the wash cycle. per flow error rates of the rounding algorithm, using soft clipping. As expected, the error rate increases as the sequencing process progresses, even after clipping. The dependency of the error rate on the position in the wash cycle is also evident. Similarly to, flows that are 11th or 27th within a cycle (marked red) display a considerably lower error rate, whereas flows that are 13th within a cycle (marked green) display considerably higher error rates T A C G T A C G T C T G A G C A T C G A T C G A T G T A C A G C T A C G T A C G T C T G A G C A T C G A T C G A T G T A C A G C T A C G T A C G T C T G A G C A T C G A T C G A T G T A C A G C T A C G T A C G T C T G A G C A T C G A T C G A T G T A C A G C T A C G T A C G T C T G A G C A T C G A T C G A T G T A C A G C T A C G T A C G T C T G A G C A T C G A T C G A T G T A C A G C T A C G T A C G T C T G A G C A T C G A T C G A T G T A C A G C T A C G T A C G T C T G A G C A T C G A T C G A T G T A C A G C T A C G T A C G T C T G A G C A T C G A T C G A T G T A C A G C T A C G T A C G T C T G A G C A T C G A T C G A T G T A C A G C T A C G T A C G T C T G A G C A T C G A T C G A T G T A C A G C T A C G T A C G T C T G. per flow error rates of the default calling algorithm used as a baseline for comparison.

conclusion although we are encouraged by the results of flow gram fixer presented here, we recognize the quick pace at which technology evolves. As Ion Torrent continues to improve its sequencing technology (e.g. its new Ion Proton sequencing platform), it is likely that important parameters, such as the wash cycle, will evolve and the specific error profiles we observe today will evolve as well. However, we believe our major innovation that inference should and could be done efficiently on the whole flow gram rather than flow by flow will remain relevant for any future flow gram based technology. Such technologies have been a major workhorse of the scientific community for several years, and it is likely they would remain relevant in upcoming years.

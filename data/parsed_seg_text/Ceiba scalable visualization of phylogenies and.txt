Phylogenetic trees with hundreds of thousands of leaves are now being inferred from sequence data, posing significant challenges for visualization and exploratory analysis. Image data supplying valuable context for species in trees (and cues for exploring them) are becoming increasingly available in biodiversity databases and elsewhere but have rarely been built into tree visualization software in a scalable way. Ceiba lets the user explore large trees and inspect image collection arrays (sets of homologous images) comprising mixtures of 2D and 3D image objects. Ceiba exploits recent improvements in graphics hardware, OpenGL toolkits and many standard high performance computer graphics strategies, such as texture compression, level of detail control, culling, animations and image caching. Its tree layouts can be tuned by user provided phylogenetic definitions of subtrees. The code has been extensively tested on phylogenies of up to 55 000 leaves and images.

introduction information visualization can foster exploratory analysis of large and complex datasets. Phylogenetic tree visualization has been an active area of research in the past decade (), with competing programs offering significantly different features, user interfaces and scalability (; one website lists 113 programs: http://bioinfo. unicef r biodiv tree editors html see Supplementary). In recent years, scalability has assumed greater importance, as phylogenetic trees have markedly increased in size. Trees with 1000 leaves are now fairly common (e.g.), and attempts to build trees with 10 00050 000 or more leaves () signal the increasing demand for large trees in comprehensive comparative studies in ecology, evolution and other domains (). Phylogenetic trees are often annotated with low complexity data, such as discrete traits (e.g. nucleotides), but many biological features, such as morphological traits, are of much higher complexity, and are commonly visualized as 2D images or 3D models reconstructed from CT scans (e.g.). Although some tree visualization programs allow imbedded images (e.g.; see Supplementary), image processing capabilities have not been prominently featured in their development, and some basic challenges to their integration into phylogenies remain. For example, in conventional 2D tree layouts, images often either occlude one another or must be greatly reduced in size to avoid this. Scalable integration of image data with tree visualization could foster exploration of comparative patterns in at least two ways: first, by using these data themselves as cues to aid navigation and exploration at large tree scales, and second, to embed these complex data types in an interactive phylogenetic framework that highlights the evolutionary links between the images. The latter may come from large databases of whole organism images, such as Encyclopedia of Life (http://eol.org), databases of specific traits, such as morph bank (http://www.morphbank.net), of 3D models derived from CT scans, such as digi morph (http://www.digimorph.org). a homologous trait. To provide phylogenetic context deeper in the tree, sample images from the image collections of the leaves are displayed in image boxes rendered at internal nodes of the hierarchy. This provides cues to the content of subtrees that can encompass a large subset of leaves (). Thus, compared with other programs that allow imbedded images, Ceiba offers two advantages: (i) rendering automatically collated image collection summaries at internal nodes, and (ii) imbedding of images at leaves in a 3D visualization that naturally lessens the impacts of image occlusion. Although a few programs are scalable to the same degree and can incorporate images (e.g. Archaeopteryx: http://www.phylosoft.org/ archaeopteryx and Supplementary), Ceiba uses a number of techniques to integrate this scalability with imbedded images. Many of these take advantage of the hierarchical decomposition of the tree to avoid expensive layout computation and rendering operations (of both trees and images) until they are needed. Culling is used extensively, and an optional image caching strategy is implemented in which recently visited but no longer visible images are freed from memory.

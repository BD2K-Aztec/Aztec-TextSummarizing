Motivation: A plethora of sequenced and genotyped disease cohorts is available to the biomedical research community, spread across many portals and represented in various formats. Results: We have gathered several large studies, including GERA and GRU, and computed population and disease specific genetic variant frequencies. In total, our portal provides fast access to genetic variants observed in 84 928 individuals from 39 disease populations. We also include 66 335 controls, such as the 1000 Genomes and Scripps well de rly. Conclusion: Combining multiple studies helps validate disease associated variants in each underlying data set, detect potential false positives using frequencies of control populations, and identify novel candidate disease causing alterations in known or suspected genes. Availability and implementation:

introduction dna sequencing and genotyping data from populations of various demographic backgrounds are becoming available to the biomedical research community at an ever increasing pace. Individually, targeted studies have provided insights into the genetic underpinnings of diseases or confirm previously identified causal alterations: for congenital heart disease (), colo boma (), schizophrenia () and numerous others. The power to discover novel, disease causing or protective alleles potentially becomes even larger when combining data from different studies, thereby increasing the number of controls and cases for related phenotypes, and helping adjust for the mutational spectrum for individuals of diverse ethnic backgrounds.

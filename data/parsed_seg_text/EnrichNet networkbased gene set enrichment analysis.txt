Motivation: Assessing functional associations between an experimentally derived gene or protein set of interest and a database of known gene protein sets is a common task in the analysis of large scale functional genomics data. For this purpose, a frequently used approach is to apply an overrepresentation based enrichment analysis. However, this approach has four drawbacks: (i) it can only score functional associations of overlapping gene proteins sets; (ii) it disregards genes with missing annotations; (iii) it does not take into account the network structure of physical interactions between the gene protein sets of interest and (iv) tissue specific gene protein set associations can not be recognized. Results: To address these limitations, we introduce an integrative analysis approach and web application called enrich net. It combines a novel graph based statistic with an interactive sub-network visualization to accomplish two complementary goals: improving the prioritization of putative functional gene protein set associations by exploiting information from molecular interaction networks and tissue specific gene expression data and enabling a direct biological interpretation of the results. By using the approach to analyse sets of genes with known involvement in human diseases, new pathway associations are identified, reflecting a dense sub-network of interactions between their corresponding proteins.

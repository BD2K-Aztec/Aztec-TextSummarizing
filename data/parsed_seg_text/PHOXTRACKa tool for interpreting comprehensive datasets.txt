We introduce phox track phospho site x tracing Analysis of Causal Kinases), a user friendly freely available software tool for analyzing large datasets of post-translational modifications of proteins, such as phosphorylation, which are commonly gained by mass spectrometry detection. In contrast to other currently applied data analysis approaches, phox track uses full sets of quantitative proteomics data and applies non-parametric statistics to calculate whether defined kinase specific sets of phospho site sequences indicate statistically significant concordant differences between various biological conditions. phox track is an efficient tool for extracting post-translational information of comprehensive proteomics datasets to decipher key regulatory proteins and to infer biologically relevant molecular pathways. Availability: phox track will be maintained over the next years and is freely available as an online tool for non-commercial use at http:// phox track molgen mpg de.

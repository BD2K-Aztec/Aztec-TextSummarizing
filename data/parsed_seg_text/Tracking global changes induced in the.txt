Motivation: The clonal theory of adaptive immunity proposes that immunological responses are encoded by increases in the frequency of lymphocytes carrying antigen specific receptors. In this study, we measure the frequency of different t cell receptors (TcR) in CD4 + T cell populations of mice immunized with a complex antigen, killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis, using high throughput parallel sequen-cing of the TcR chain. Our initial hypothesis that immunization would induce repertoire convergence proved to be incorrect, and therefore an alternative approach was developed that allows accurate stratifi-cation of TcR repertoires and provides novel insights into the nature of CD4 + t cell receptor recognition. Results: To track the changes induced by immunization within this heterogeneous repertoire, the sequence data were classified by counting the frequency of different clusters of short (3 or 4) continuous stretches of amino acids within the antigen binding complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) repertoire of different mice. Both un-supervised (hierarchical clustering) and supervised (support vector machine) analyses of these different distributions of sequence clusters differentiated between immunized and un immunized mice with 100% efficiency. The CD4 + TcR repertoires of mice 5 and 14 days post immunization were clearly different from that of un immunized mice but were not distinguishable from each other. However, the repertoires of mice 60 days post immunization were distinct both from naive mice and the day 5/14 animals. Our results reinforce the remarkable diversity of the TcR repertoire, resulting in many diverse private TcRs contributing to the t cell response even in genetically identical mice responding to the same antigen. However, specific motifs defined by short stretches of amino acids within the CDR3 region may determine TcR specificity and define a new approach to TcR sequence classification. Availability and implementation: The analysis was implemented in R and Python, and source code can be found in Supplementary Data.

introduction adaptive immunity is carried out by populations of B and T lymphocytes, which collectively express a large set of different antigen specific receptors created during ha emo poes is by a unique process of somatic cell gene rearrangements. The clonal theory of immunity () proposes that lymphocytes carrying receptors that specifically bind an antigen to which the immune system is exposed, for example, during infection or vaccination, respond by proliferating and differentiating. This population of expanded and differentiated cells then confer on the system the ability to respond specifically to the antigen to which they had previously been exposed. The clonal theory therefore explains the immune system properties of specificity and memory. A prediction of this theory is that the frequency of lymphocytes that have been exposed to antigen (i.e. memory or effector cells) will be greater than the frequency of those that have not (i.e. naive). This prediction has been verified for T cells in a wide variety of models, using antigen specific readouts such as cytokine responses, and Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) multi mer binding to identify expanded lymphocyte clones (). The selective expansion of specific clones has also been inferred from global measurements such as V region usage () or spectra typing (a technique sometimes referred to as the immuno scope (). Previous studies have distinguished between private t cell receptors (TcRs), found in one or a few individuals, and public TcRs found within the responding repertoire of a majority of individuals. The response to many antigens seems to consist of a mixture of public and private specificities (). The introduction of short read parallel high throughput sequencing (HTS) provides an alternative approach to measuring lymphocyte receptor frequencies, allowing evaluation of the global receptor repertoire of particular lymphocyte populations. Rearranged receptor genes, or their mRNA products, are expanded and then sequenced directly, and the number of times each unique receptor sequence is found is simply counted. This approach can in principle generate an accurate estimate of the number of times each unique lymphocyte receptor is present in a particular population, and this information should reflect the prior antigen exposure of the individual.

Complementary work on antibody repertoire diversity has also been conducted in the zebrafish, again showing non-uniform V(D)J recombination that is qualitatively conserved between individuals ().also show that this repertoire is shaped by maturity, with a greater skew in V(D)J usage observed at 2 months compared with 2 week old individuals. Other studies have used HTS to provide unexpected insight into the naive and memory t cell compartments, revealing that the memory compartment may be far more diverse than previously thought (). A major goal is to use the HTS lymphocyte receptor sequence data to identify antigen specific changes in the repertoire at a global level. There remain some major challenges, however. First, HTS generates primary sequence data, which can not be easily mapped onto three dimensional receptor conformation, much less onto intrinsic antigen specificity. Second, current technologies do not yet provide easy ways to link the two chains of the antigen specific receptor (heavy and light for antibody, and or and for T cells) at a single cell level. The majority of studies of t cell repertoires using HTS have focused only on chains. The antigen specificity of the receptor will depend on the pairing of a specific and chain, and therefore can not be inferred from chains alone. Despite these limitations, there are a number of indications that local features of protein primary structure may contain hidden information that reflects specific protein protein interactions occurring at the level of a fully folded tertiary or quaternary structure. One interesting example is the analysis of conserved amino acid pairs within a family of homologous proteins that has recently been used to predict with remarkable accuracy the structure of the fully folded protein on the basis of conserved protein protein interactions (). Consequently, some success has also been achieved using a primary protein structure to predict antibody antigen docking (). From a machine learning perspective, these approaches are reminiscent of algorithms that use local low level features, such as individual words or image fragments, to produce remarkably efficient classification of complex large datasets, such as sets of documents or images. Surprisingly, good results can be achieved with little regard for the semantic content or meaning of these types of data. We thought that local sequence features could be used to define antigen specific changes in the TcR repertoire following immunization, reflecting underlying information on the nature of interactions between TcR and peptide mhc complexes. In this study, we develop an approach based on the well studied bag of words (BOW) () algorithm to categorize and classify sets of TcR sequences from immunized and un immunized mice at different times post immunization. Our data highlight the extraordinary diversity of the t cell repertoire, which result in every individual mouse expressing a majority of receptors that are unique to that individual. Within this ocean of diversity, conventional methods to identify the antigen specific component of the response by looking for shared expanded clones are problematic. Surprisingly, however, localized sequence features (similar short stretches of adjacent amino acids) can be used to generate a high dimensional feature space, in which the distinct experimental groups can be readily distinguished with a high degree of accuracy. Short motifs in complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) primary sequence may therefore play an important role in determining TcR specificity. Our results suggest that the response to antigen may be an emergent property of the repertoire, dominated by clones found only in that individual (private specificities), and distributed over many low frequency lymphocytes each with different receptors.

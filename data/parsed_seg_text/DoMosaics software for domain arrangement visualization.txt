do mosaics is an application that unifies protein domain annotation, domain arrangement analysis and visualization in a single tool. It simplifies the analysis of protein families by consolidating disjunct procedures based on often inconvenient command line applications and complex analysis tools. It provides a simple user interface with access to domain annotation services such as interpro scan or a local HMMER installation, and can be used to compare , analyze and visualize the evolution of domain architectures.

introduction protein evolution can be treated as a series of domain wise changes that alter their domain arrangement (or architecture), the sequence of a proteins' constituent domains. The majority of novel arrangements can be explained by rearranging domains and processes such as fusion, fission and terminal domain loss are thought to be the primary forces at play (). The signatures of domains are stored in specialized domain databases such as Pfam (), SUPERFAMILY () or InterPro (). Existing tools that exploit domain content for evolutionary analysis focus on specific aspects, primarily the identification of homologous proteins, and are often limited to a single domain definition database. Services are either provided in the form of web servers such as do mix () or da hunter (now w dac (), or as standalone applications such as pfam a lyze r (), n if as () or x dom (). The recently described tool arch schema () takes a domain graph approach to illustrate related domain arrangements. However, none of these tools combine annotation, analysis, search and visualization into a single framework do mosaics collates all steps from domain annotation, homology search, analysis of architectural evolution to creation of customizable publication ready figures into a single tool.

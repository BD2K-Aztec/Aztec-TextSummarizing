Background: gene and pathway based analyses offer a useful alternative and complement to the usual single snp based analysis for g was. On the other hand, most existing gene and pathway based tests are not highly adaptive, and or require the availability of individual level genotype and phenotype data. It would be desirable to have highly adaptive tests applicable to summary statistics for single SNPs. This has become increasingly important given the popularity of large scale meta analyses of multiple gw ass and the practical availability of either single g was or meta analyzed g was summary statistics for single SNPs. Results: We extend two adaptive tests for gene and pathway level association with a univariate trait to the case with g was summary statistics without individual level genotype and phenotype data. We use the wtc cc g was data to evaluate and compare the proposed methods and several existing methods. We further illustrate their applications to a meta analyzed dataset to identify genes and pathways associated with blood pressure, demonstrating the potential usefulness of the proposed methods. The methods are implemented in R package as pu freely and publicly available. Availability and implementation: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/aSPU/

introduction in spite of the tremendous success of genome wide association studies gw ass due to modest to small effect sizes of the majority of causal SNPs for complex and common disease, large sample sizes and more powerful statistical tests are always needed. Furthermore, even when some associated SNPs or loci are identified by the most popular single snp based analysis, it is often extremely difficult to offer a functional interpretation that can shed light on the underlying biology. As alternatives, gene and pathway based analyses have been proposed and applied for single traits, demonstrating their useful and complementary roles (). A statistical challenge is that, due to unknown true association patterns, there is no uniformly most powerful test to detect multiple snp single trait associations; an association test may perform well for one dataset, but not necessarily for another. For example, the presence of non associated SNPs will largely diminish the power of a standard test if no effective SNP selection or weighting is adopted ().proposed a data adaptive as pu approach based on estimating and selecting the most powerful test among a class of so called sum of powered score (SPU) tests, which cover several popular tests as special cases, such as the burden test, a variance component test and a univariate test. The main idea is to use various values of a parameter to construct data driven and varying weights for the SNPs, thus adaptive to unknown signal sparsity and association directions among the multiple SNPs being tested. furthermore extended the methodology to pathway analysis as pu path. In particular, two parameters are introduced such that the test is adaptive at both the SNP and gene levels. As demonstrated therein, due to their high data adaptivity the two adaptive tests remained powerful across a wide range of scenarios however the two adaptive tests for gene and pathway single trait associations are only applicable to the case with individual level genotype and phenotype data. Due to various reasons, it is often difficult for many researchers to obtain access to individual level data. At the same time, it is easier to obtain access to some summary statistics, e.g. p values of individual SNPs in a g was. In addition, use of some summary statistics is often necessary for practical meta analyses, which have become increasingly popular and important for complex disease and traits (). Here we propose extending the two highly adaptive tests to the case with only summary statistics for individual SNPs, demonstrating their applications to a meta analyzed g was dataset for blood pressure (). In numerical examples we compared our methods with gene based GATES () and three pathway based approaches, gates simes (), HYST () and MAGMA (). All methods are for a single (univariate) trait. GATES adopts an extended Simes procedure to correct multiple testing while calculating the p value quickly based on SNP summary statistics. gates simes extends the main idea of GATES to extract the most significant gene level p value for a pathway, whereas HYST uses Fisher's method to combine multiple genes' p values. MAGMA is based on multiple regression. We also considered one gene set enrichment analysis g sea method, igs eag was (), an extension of g sea () to g was summary statistics. Note that here our goal is global association testing in the category of self contained tests' with a null hypothesis H 0 that none of any genes in a pathway is associated with disease, in contrast to enrichment or competitive testing with a null hypothesis H 0;E that the proportion of associated genes in a pathway is no more than that in the rest of the genes; since rejecting H 0;E implies rejecting H 0 , a global testing is often more powerful than an enrichment analysis (). The proposed methods are available in R package as pu which is downloadable from CRAN.

discussion we have proposed two adaptive tests, asp us and asp us path respectively for gene and pathway level association analyses of a univariate trait with the availability of only summary statistics, such as z statistics or p values for individual SNPs. With only summary statistics like z statistics or p values one has to recourse to some reference panel to estimate LD or correlations among SNPs, which adaptive gene and pathway trait association testing might influence the performance of subsequent association testing. Overall, the p values calculated from using different panels were similar as shown in our analysis of the wtc cc data. However, depending on the reference panels being used, the results for a small number of the genes or pathways could be different. Hence, caution must be taken, and an independent validation on any detected associations based on summary statistics becomes more important. We have further illustrated the application of the proposed methods to a meta analyzed g was data, demonstrating their usefulness as compared to the popular single snp based analysis. In addition, we have compared their performance with several other existing tests. Since there is no uniformly most powerful test for multiple SNPs, it would be desirable to have an adaptive test that can robustly maintain high, not necessarily highest, power across various scenarios, which motivated our proposed two tests (). Our proposed tests offer an alternative and complement to existing gene and pathway level association testing. We have developed an R package as pu to facilitate their use.

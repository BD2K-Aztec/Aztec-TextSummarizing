Computer simulations are giving way to more complex and accurate studies of biological membranes by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The analysis of MD trajectories comprises the bio-physical characterization of membrane properties or the study of protein lipid interactions and dynamics. However, there is a lack of automated tools to analyse MD simulations of complex membrane or membrane protein systems. Here we present memb plugin a plugin for the Visual Molecular Dynamics package that provides algorithms to measure a host of essential biophysical properties in simulated membranes. memb plugin features are accessible both through a user friendly graphical interface and as command line procedures to be invoked in analysis scripts. Availability and implementation: memb plugin is a VMD extension written in Tcl. Multi-platform source code, documentation and tutorials are freely available at http://membplugin.sourceforge.net.

introduction although membrane lipids were previously thought to only play a passive role in cellular processes, it is now known that they actively modulate key cell membrane complexes such as lipid rafts (). As a result, some lipids can regulate protein functionality () and some are involved in severe diseases (). The experimental and computational study of membrane lipids is an emergent field of research (van); thanks to the refinement of lipid force field parameters, modern membrane simulations and analysis tools (Supplementary) are able to yield accurate biophysical properties close to experimental values () and observables that would otherwise be out of reach of experimental techniques. Here we describe memb plugin an extension to the free molecular visualization program Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) () to study the biophysical properties of membranes and membrane protein interactions via molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

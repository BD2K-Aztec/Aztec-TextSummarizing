Count is a software package for the analysis of numerical profiles on a phylogeny. It is primarily designed to deal with profiles derived from the phyletic distribution of homologous gene families, but is suited to study any other integer value d evolutionary characters. Count performs ancestral reconstruction, and infers family and lineage specific characteristics along the evolutionary tree. It implements popular methods employed in gene content analysis such as doll o and Wagner parsimony, propensity for gene loss, as well as probabilistic methods involving a phylogenetic birth and death model. Availability: Count is available as a stand-alone Java application, as well as an application bundle for MacOS X, at the web site

introduction some aspects of genome evolution are best captured by integer quantities. Given a phylogeny with terminal tax a X , such a quantity forms a numerical profile, which extends the so called phylogenetic profile of presence absence () : X {0,1,2,...,}. In a typical application denotes the number of genes in genome x  X for a certain homolog gene family: a homolog family comprises all descendants of the same ancestral gene () in evolutionary lineages. Such families are routinely identified by pairwise sequence comparisons, coupled with the clustering of postulated homolog pairs (). In other interesting examples might be the size () of genome x or a sequence length polymorphism in population x (). Given a phylogeny, an evolutionary character's history can be inferred by various means in order to reconstruct its state at ancestral nodes or to estimate the tempo of evolution (). The Count software package provides a convenient graphical user interface to sophisticated computational methods in such analyses, and to the manipulation of datasets involving numerical profiles. Count was already used to study the evolution of gene repertoire in Archaea () and nucleo-cytoplasmic DNA viruses ().

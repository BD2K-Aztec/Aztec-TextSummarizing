maldi quant is an R package providing a complete and modular analysis pipeline for quantitative analysis of mass spectro-metry data. maldi quant is specifically designed with application in clinical diagnostics in mind and implements sophisticated routines for importing raw data, preprocessing, non-linear peak alignment and calibration. It also handles technical replicates as well as spectra with unequal resolution. Availability: maldi quant and its associated R packages read bruker flex data and read mz xml data are freely available from the R archive CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org).

introduction mass spectrometry profiling is increasingly becoming an important tool in clinical diagnostics, for example to identify biomarkers for cancer (e.g.). Similarly as with other high throughput technologies, sophisticated statistical algorithms are essential in the analysis of spectrometry data (). We have developed maldi quant to provide a complete open source analysis pipeline on the R platform (R Development) comprising all steps from importing of raw data, preprocessing (e.g. baseline removal), peak detection and non-linear peak alignment to calibration of mass spectra. maldi quant is written as a standalone package using S4 object oriented programming to facilitate further extension. maldi quant was initially developed for clinical proteomics using matrix assisted Laser desorption ionization (MALDI) technology. However, the algorithms implemented in maldi quant are generic and may be equally applied to other 2D mass spectrometry data.

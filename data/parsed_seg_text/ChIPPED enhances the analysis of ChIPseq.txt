Motivation: Although chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high throughput sequencing chips eq or tiling array hybridization chip chip is increasingly used to map genome wide binding sites of transcription factors (TFs), it still remains difficult to generate a quality chip x (i.e. chips eq or chip chip dataset because of the tremendous amount of effort required to develop effective antibodies and efficient protocols. Moreover, most laboratories are unable to easily obtain chip x data for one or more TF(s) in more than a handful of biological contexts. Thus, standard chip x analyses primarily focus on analyzing data from one experiment, and the discoveries are restricted to a specific biological context. Results: We propose to enrich this existing data analysis paradigm by developing a novel approach, ChIPPED , which superimposes chip x data on large amounts of publicly available human and mouse gene expression data containing a diverse collection of cell types, tissues and disease conditions to discover new biological contexts with potential TF regulatory activities. We demonstrate ChIPPED using a number of examples, including a novel discovery that MYC, a human TF, plays an important functional role in pediatric Ewing sar-coma cell lines. These examples show that ChIPPED increases the value of chip x data by allowing one to expand the scope of possible discoveries made from a chip x experiment.

introduction chip x experiments, including chips eq () and chip chip (), have become a powerful tool used by individual investigators, as well as consortium projects, such as the ENCODE () to study transcription factor binding sites. Each individual chip x experiment is non-trivial to perform extensive time and effort must be spent to acquire effective antibodies and design efficient protocols to generate high quality chip x data thus it is important to develop methodology to help investigators to maximize the value of each individual chip x experiment. One of the primary limitations of chip x is it may be difficult for individual laboratories to study TF regulation in a wide variety of biological contexts, which we define as the cell or tissue types and associated treatments or disease conditions (see definition details in Supplementary Method 1.1). This is largely because of the prohibitively high labor and time costs to perform each experiment. To resolve this limitation, we investigate whether publicly available gene expression data (PED) in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO;) can be used as a tool to increase the value of chip x experiments. Currently, 4600 000 gene expression samples from a broad spectrum of biological contexts and species are deposited in the GEO and array express (). These data are freely available and contain rich information complementary to chip x which may be extremely useful to help study TF regulation. In this article, we demonstrate that this is indeed the case by proposing and evaluating a new approach, ChIP-PED. Given a TF regulatory pathway, i.e. a TF and the corresponding set of target genes defined using chip x and gene expression data in one or more biological contexts, ChIP-PED scans through a large collection of 420 000 human and mouse gene expression samples generated by hundreds of different laboratories by quickly surveying the TF and target gene activities across 42000 biological contexts to identify potentially new connections between the TF regulatory pathway and various cell types, tissues or diseases (). We will illustrate that the predictions from ChIP-PED are useful and can greatly expand the scope of discoveries one can make from chip x experiments. We also provide an R package for users to perform ChIP-PED analyses on their own chip x and TF perturbation data. ChIP-PED represents a novel conceptual approach to building computational tools for chip x data analysis. Most existing tools for analyzing chip x data, including those for detecting protein dna binding sites (), discovering dna binding motifs (), correlating chip x with gene expression data () and so forth, focus on *To whom correspondence should be addressed. y The authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the first two authors should be regarded as joint First Authors.

Their discoveries are also typically restricted to the biological context in which the chip x experiments are performed, and none of them systematically integrates information from PED. PED has been shown to be invaluable in other applications (), but the possibility of using PED as a tool to boost the analysis of chip x data still remains largely unexplored. A number of methods do integrate large amounts of chip x and gene expression data to construct gene regulatory networks, but most are primarily used to study lower organisms (e.g. yeast;). The present study is different from those described works, as ChIP-PED focuses specifically on integrating chip x with large amounts of heterogeneous data in human and mouse to improve chip x analyses. Instead of attempting to construct a comprehensive gene regulatory network, the primary goal of ChIP-PED is to produce simple testable hypotheses, such as 'TF A is functionally active in biological contexts X, Y and Z through target gene set S'.

discussion we have shown that ChIP-PED can improve the analysis of chip x data by integrating publicly available gene expression data. Given a TF and its target genes, ChIP-PED examines the expression of the TF and the activity of its target genes across an assortment of diverse biological contexts to search for contexts with enriched regulatory activity of the TF. This process may lead to the discovery of novel functional connections between TF regulatory pathways and diseases, thus providing a cost effective way to expand knowledge from one chip x study to other research areas. We view ChIP-PED as an exploratory tool for fast and cost effective hypothesis generation and screening. In this respect, the default cut-offs that define high or low tf expression or TG activity should be primarily used for initial exploration or first pass automatic hypothesis screening, rather than as strict optimal cut-offs that apply to all TFs. Based on our real data analysis experience, we found it difficult to set a single consistent cut off that was optimal across all TFs, as TFs can vary greatly in terms of regulatory behavior (). We, therefore, provide users with the flexibility to choose their own cut-offs, which can be adjusted to decrease or increase the number of predicted contexts (Supplementary Method 1.15). ChIP-PED acts primarily as a guide to highlight biological contexts that would be good leads for experimental investigation. As such, we do not expect all ChIP-PED predictions to be correct nor for ChIP-PED to recover all tf active biological contexts. This, however, does not prevent ChIP-PED from being a useful and unique tool: our analyses have shown that it can predict many known and new tf active contexts with reasonable accuracy, and there currently exists no other computational method for analyzing chip x data that performs a similar task. Although we have shown that ChIP-PED is able to capture pertinent biological information in PED, better statistical models are still needed to address technical biases and variations because of laboratory and batch effects. A natural extension of ChIPPED would be to analyze multiple TFs and their TGs together to better connect cooperative TF regulatory pathways to cell types and diseases. Similarly, more work is also needed to understand how homologous TFs or other TFs with similar regulatory functions impact the regulatory activity of the TF of interest in different contexts. Our study is not necessarily the best or only way to integrate chip x and PED; however, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of using PED to enhance chip x analyses in human and mouse. We hope that ChIP-PED will inspire new computational approaches that continue to maximize the value of chips eq and chip chip experiments.

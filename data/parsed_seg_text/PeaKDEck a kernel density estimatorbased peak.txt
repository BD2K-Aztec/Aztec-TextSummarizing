Hypersensitivity to DNaseI digestion is a hallmark of open chromatin, and dnasei seq allows the genome wide identification of regions of open chromatin. Interpreting these data is challenging, largely because of inherent variation in signal to noise ratio between datasets. We have developed peak deck a peak calling program that distinguishes signal from noise by randomly sampling read densities and using kernel density estimation to generate a dataset specific probability distribution of random background signal. peak deck uses this probability distribution to select an appropriate read density threshold for peak calling in each dataset. We benchmark peak deck using published ENCODE dnasei seq data and other peak calling programs, and demonstrate superior performance in low signal to noise ratio datasets. Availability and implementation: peak deck is written in standard Perl and runs on any platform with Perl installed. peak deck is also available as a standalone application written in Perl/Tk, which does not require Perl to be installed.

introduction dnasei hypersensitivity analysis can be used to map sites of open chromatin in genomic DNA (). Hypersensitivity of DNA to digestion by DNaseI arises when nucleosomal histone proteins are displaced from chromatin, leaving a region of 'naked' nucleosome free DNA that is accessible to the DNaseI enzyme (Owen). Histone displacement and consequent DNaseI hypersensitivity characteristically occur at promoter and enhancer sites (), allowing the sequence specific binding of proteins, such as transcription factors to the DNA. Recently, advances in high throughput sequencing methods have been applied to DNaseI hypersensitivity testing dnasei seq Supplementary Information, Section S1; (). With dnasei seq regulatory DNA fragments at accessible open chromatin sites are released by two hit digestion. These fragments are sequenced using high throughput technology and mapped back to the reference genome. The comparison of DNaseI hypersensitivity patterns in different datasets can play an important role in the study of gene regulation (), for example, in response to a physiological stimulus. However, a major challenge in analyzing these data is the variation in signal to noise ratio (SNR) between datasets (Supplementary). While many potential sources of noise exist, a key variable affecting the SNR is the enzymatic activity of DNaseI, which is difficult to control between experiments. Variation in the level of DNaseI activity leads to different amounts of digestion (Supplementary), altering the composition of the population of short DNA fragments that are sequenced. There is no universal surrogate measurement of digestion that can be used to accurately quantify digestion at the library preparation stage and no ideal control sample (discussed in Supplementary Information, Section S2). For these reasons, distinguishing signal from noise in a manner that allows comparison between datasets is more challenging with dnasei seq than with other high throughput sequencing approaches, such as chips eq. Several peak calling programs have been developed for use with high throughput sequencing data. Most focus on chips eq where a clear input control is available, but some have also been used for dnasei seq data, including f seq (), MACS () and HOMER (). While analyzing our own dnasei seq data, we found variable performance between peak callers, particularly at low SNRs, and the identification of a suitable peak threshold was challenging. This confounded the comparison between datasets with different SNRs (see Supplementary Information, Section S4 for SNR estimation). We have developed a peak calling algorithm peak deck that limits the effect of SNR on threshold setting, which is of particular value in datasets with lower SNRs. We have used hotspot identified () dnasei seq sites from 125 cell types published by ENCODE () to compare the quality of peak calling by peak deck with that by other peak calling programs. peak deck also includes additional tools for dnasei seq data analysis (see Supplementary Information, Section S9 for description of additional tools this is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/), which permits unrestricted reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. randomly from the genome, and overlapping sites are discarded (Supplementary). Next, the signal strength is measured at the non-overlapping sites using sampling bins (and Supplementary). This is achieved by measuring the background read density in a large bin surrounding the site ('background read density'; default 3000 bp), and then measuring the read density in a smaller focused bin at the same site ('central read density'; default 300 bp). The corrected read density is calculated by subtracting the expected read density (given the background read density) from the central read density. Once this calculation has been repeated for all the randomly selected sites in the dataset, a probability distribution is generated to describe the distribution of these corrected read density scores (Supplementary). Because the distribution of these scores is typically non gaussian peak deck uses kernel density estimation (Supplementary Information, Section S5) to calculate a probability distribution for the randomly selected corrected read density scores, where n is the number of sites sampled, h is the bandwidth (h  1), x i is the value of x for the ith site and K u is a Gaussian kernel:

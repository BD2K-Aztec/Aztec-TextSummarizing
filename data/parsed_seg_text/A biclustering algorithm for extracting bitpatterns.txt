Motivation: Binary datasets represent a compact and simple way to store data about the relationships between a group of objects and their possible properties. In the last few years, different bi clustering algorithms have been specially developed to be applied to binary datasets. Several approaches based on matrix factorization, suffix trees or divide and conquer techniques have been proposed to extract useful bi clusters from binary data, and these approaches provide information about the distribution of patterns and intrinsic correlations. Results: A novel approach to extracting bi clusters from binary datasets, bib it is introduced here. The results obtained from different experiments with synthetic data reveal the excellent performance and the robustness of bib it to density and size of input data. Also, bib it is applied to a central nervous system embryonic tumor gene expression dataset to test the quality of the results. A novel gene expression preprocessing methodology, based on expression level layers, and the selective search performed by bib it based on a very fast bit pattern processing technique, provide very satisfactory results in quality and computational cost. The power of bi clustering in finding genes involved simultaneously in different cancer processes is also shown. Finally, a comparison with bi max one of the most cited binary bi clustering algorithms, shows that bib it is faster while providing essentially the same results.

introduction binary datasets represent a compact and simple way to store data about the relationships between a group of objects and their possible properties. This type of data is present in many research fields, including data mining (), text mining (), bioinformatics (), engineering () or paleontology * To whom correspondence should be addressed.(), among others. What the values 0 and 1 stand for depends on the context. For example, when working with gene and protein features, if gene r encodes a protein that belongs to a protein of class c, then r,c is equal to 1; otherwise, it is equal to 0 (). Commonly, the binary values 1 and 0 mean that under experimental condition c, gene r is either expressed or not, respectively (). In some transcription regulation datasets, a matrix element is 1 if the transcription factor associated with the motif group putatively binds the upstream region of a certain gene (). Clustering is one of the most popular techniques used to identify the distribution of patterns and intrinsic correlations in large datasets (). However, the impossibility of discovering local patterns by this technique has led to the popularization of bi clustering algorithms, which are able to analyze all dataset dimensions simultaneously and, consequently, extract local patterns that provide a better understanding of the underlying biological phenomena. Different bi clustering algorithms have been developed for their use with binary datasets. For example, in, bi clusters are defined as submatrices dense enough with 1's to be considered statistically significant. Based on the same concept, the work of van adapts a score function to effectively deal with sparse binary datasets. However, these changes lead to a more complicated user input parameters. Besides, all the elements of every generated bi cluster are set to zero in the input matrix, introducing noise. Matrix factorization can be applied to reduce the dimensionality of data, yielding a representation of conditions as linear combinations of a reduced set of k factors. Based on this idea, a Binary Matrix Factorization (BMF) algorithm is presented in. The objective is to decompose the input binary matrix, X, into two binary matrices, W and H, such that X  WH. Determining the suitable number of factors k is, however, the main hurdle with these type of approaches (). Suffix trees have also been used to extract bi clusters from binary matrices. Thus, the ebi motif algorithm () combines sequence alignment with an adaptation of the ecc cbi clustering algorithm () to further group sequences with similar motif structures. To find all the maximal contiguous column bi clusters the ebi motif algorithm generates a suffix tree T from a binary matrix where rows and columns represent candidate motifs and sequences, respectively. Then, T is used to spell all valid bi clusters taking into account an error threshold in the structure of the motifs.

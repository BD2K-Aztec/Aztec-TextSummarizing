The g hap R package was designed to call haplotypes from phased marker data. Given user defined haplotype blocks hap block the package identifies the different haplotype alleles hap allele present in the data and scores sample haplotype allele genotypes hap genotype based on hap allele dose (i.e. 0, 1 or 2 copies). The output is not only useful for analyses that can handle multi allelic markers, but is also conveniently formatted for existing pipelines intended for bi allelic markers.

introduction the use of high density marker panels in genomics relies on the concept of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and tagging, such that information from unobserved variants can be indirectly captured by correlation with nearby markers (). Methods for genomic analysis are usually based on single markers, ignoring that unobserved variants may be better modeled by the use of phase information (). Moreover, the need for tools to perform haplotype calls from phased data has been underserved in spite of the growing interest in haplotype based analyses in the last years. Here we describe g hap an R package designed to call haplotypes from phased data. The goal of g hap is to compute summary statistics for haplotype blocks hap block and haplotype alleles hap allele as well as to construct a matrix of haplotype genotypes hap genotype. As a general framework, each hap allele can be treated as a pseudo marker in downstream analyses, facilitating the incorporation of phase information in existing pipelines. This approach differs from competing methods as it uses hap allele as markers, instead of hidden haplotype states generated by expectation maximization or hidden Markov models.

conclusion the g hap package provides means for haplotype calling, facilitating the incorporation of phase information in genome wide analyses. The package is available at: https://cran.r-project.org/ package g hap

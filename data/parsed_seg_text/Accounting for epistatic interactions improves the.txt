Motivation: The constraints under which sequence, structure and function co evolve are not fully understood. Bringing this mutual relationship to light can reveal the molecular basis of binding, catalysis and all oster y thereby identifying function and rationally guiding protein redesign. Underlying these relationships are the epistatic interactions that occur when the consequences of a mutation to a protein are determined by the genetic background in which it occurs. Based on prior data, we hypothesize that epistatic forces operate most strongly between residues nearby in the structure, resulting in smooth evolutionary importance across the structure. Methods and Results: We find that when residue scores of evolutionary importance are distributed smoothly between nearby residues, functional site prediction accuracy improves. Accordingly, we designed a novel measure of evolutionary importance that focuses on the interaction between pairs of structurally neighboring residues. This measure that we term pair interaction Evolutionary Trace yields greater functional site overlap and better structure based proteome wide functional predictions. Conclusions: Our data show that the structural smoothness of evolutionary importance is a fundamental feature of the coevolution of sequence, structure and function. Mutations operate on individual residues, but selective pressure depends in part on the extent to which a mutation perturbs interactions with neighboring residues. In practice, this principle led us to redefine the importance of a residue in terms of the importance of its epistatic interactions with neighbors, yielding better annotation of functional residues, motivating experimental validation of a novel functional site in LexA and refining protein function prediction.

introduction protein functional sites and their key residue determinants are important to elucidate the molecular details underlying protein function (), design drugs (), engineer proteins () and predict protein function (). The experimental gold standard to map these sites is alanine scanning (), but this approach is rarely exhaustive and limited by the availability of biologically relevant assays. Therefore, complementary, inexpensive and scalable approaches search for functional sites and residues by analyzing the vast evolutionary record of protein sequences computationally (). The Evolutionary Trace (ET) () identifies functionally important residue positions by finding sequence substitution patterns correlated with divergences among homologs, thereby explicitly taking phylogenetic relationships into account. ET predictions have been extensively validated experimentally () and through large scale retrospective predictions of functional sites () and protein functions (). These studies point to a number of general and consistent observations in well structured protein domains: (i) sequence positions may be ranked by evolutionary importance; (ii) most important sequence residues cluster structurally (); (iii) these structural clusters predict functional sites (), such that (iv) small structure function motifs called 3D templates based on these clusters can predict protein function on a genomic scale (). The evolutionary principles that give rise to these useful patterns remain unclear. This work suggests that epistasis drives these patterns. Traditionally, epistasis means interactions between genes; however, it is also recognized as a major force in molecular evolution of individual proteins (). Strong epistatic interactions occur between contact residues (), presumably because function and adaptation are intimately related to mutual interaction and variation of physically neighboring residues. Indeed, improving the clustering quality of evolutionarily important residues improves predictions of *To whom correspondence should be addressed.  The Author 2013.

In that light, the clustering of these residues simply reflects the fundamental epistatic coupling of neighbors. These observations motivate a series of hypotheses. We hypothesize that if epistasis and function constrain residue neighbors during selective pressure, then evolutionary importance should distribute smoothly over a protein structure. If so, optimizing ET rank smoothness, for example, by selecting sequences appropriately, should improve predictions of functional sites, molecular determinants and functions. Thereby, a modified ET algorithm could directly enforce smoothness and improve predictions by focusing primarily on epistatic interactions. Our results show that, in practice, we can assess ET rank smoothness by treating the structure as a network, or graph, of amino acid nodes, linking these nodes by edges indicating structural contact and applying the discrete Laplacian operator from a graph theory to quantify ET smoothness. Selections of input sequences that minimize the smoothing function constructed from the Laplacian operator then led to better functional site analyses by ET. Moreover, a new inherently smoother pair interaction Evolutionary Trace (piET) algorithm built to measure the importance of neighbor to neighbor residue pairs, instead of single residues, improves functional site predictions in retrospective study and in an experimental application on Escherichia coli lexa a protein that triggers the SOS response through which bacteria evolve drug resistance. Finally, piET improves large scale functional annotations. Together, these data show that the smoothest structural distribution of evolutionary importance reflects functional information best, and that epistatic interactions are strongly reflective of the effective distance between residues.

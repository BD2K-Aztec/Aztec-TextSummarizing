Motivation: exo me sequencing exo me seq data, which are typically used for calling exonic mutations, have also been utilized in detecting DNA copy number variations cn vs. Despite the existence of several CNV detection tools, there is still a great need for a sensitive and an accurate cnv calling algorithm with built in QC steps, and does not require a paired reference for each sample. Results: We developed a novel method named pattern cnv which (i) accounts for the read coverage variations between exons while lever-aging the consistencies of this variability across different samples; (ii) reduces alignment BAM files to WIG format and therefore greatly accelerates computation; (iii) incorporates multiple QC measures designed to identify outlier samples and batch effects; and (iv) provides a variety of visualization options including chromosome, gene and exon level views of cn vs along with a tabular summarization of the exon level cn vs. Compared with other cnv calling algorithms using data from a lymphoma exo me seq study, pattern cnv has higher sensitivity and specificity. Availability and implementation: The software for pattern cnv is implemented using Perl and R, and can be used in Mac or Linux environments. Software and user manual are available at http:// bioinformatics tools mayo edu research pattern cnv and R package at https://github.com/topsoil/patternCNV/.

introduction dna copy number variations cn vs are genomic structural changes that result in regional or chromosomal loss or gain of DNA copies (). Owing to the significant roles in human diseases, various laboratory techniques have been developed to detect cn vs including recently advanced massive parallel sequencing of whole genomes and coding exo mes. For exo me seq it is commonly observed that coverage depths of short reads across regions vary, caused by different target capture efficiencies (), as well as the differences in mapp ability of exons. Such coverage variations impose substantial challenges for reliable CNV detection. Most existing methods use a paired sample approach, based on the intuitive assumption that somatic sample and its paired reference share similar coverage bias that can be cancelled out through pairing (). Although this assumption approximately holds, it oversimplifies the problem with two limitations unaddressed: (i) The region specific noise (coverage variability) of a local region is not accounted for, leading to amplified noise in log ratio values of coverage between sample and the paired reference. (ii) In the case of a missing or low quality reference sample, CNV detection based on paired reference will be infeasible or have degraded accuracy sensitivity. A recent published method, fishing cnv tried to address the second limitation by using the average of multiple reference samples as the denominators in log ratio calculation, but did not address the regional noises in individual samples (the numerator), which led to false CNV calls (details in Supplementary Section S2.3). Considering these issues, we proposed a novel method called pattern cnv which summarizes overall consistent patterns of both depths and variability of exonic region coverage across samples, where 'patterns' of coverage and variability are summarized using multiple 'normal' or reference samples. We observed that the same patterns only exist between samples prepared using the same version of exo me capture kit. During CNV detection, we compute the differences of observed coverage versus the common pattern, while penalizing regions associated with larger variability using a weighting scheme. Further, whole genome CNV can be interpolated from exon level CNV using any third party segmentation method, e.g. circular binary segmentation (). The pattern cnv was implemented in two different versions: a Mac and linux unix version, and an R package version. We also developed a conversion tool to transform Binary version *To whom correspondence should be addressed. y The authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the first two authors should be regarded as joint First Authors.

In this work we present which cyp a tool for prediction of which cytochromes P450 isoforms (among 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4) a given molecule is likely to inhibit. The models are built from experimental high throughput data using support vector machines and molecular signatures. Availability: The which cyp server is freely available for use on the web at http://drug.ku.dk/whichcyp, where the which cyp Java program and source code is also available for download.

introduction the cytochromes P450 (CYP) is a ubiquitous enzyme family found throughout the nature. These enzymes are involved in the metabolism of a large majority of the drugs in use today (). Modeling of their interactions with drug like compounds have been a hot topic during the past decade, stretching from quantum mechanical studies of reaction mechanisms to data mining approaches and QSAR studies (). The five most important human CYP isoforms, with regard to drug metabolism, are 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4 (). In 2009, a large high throughput study of inhibition to these isoforms was performed (), enabling the application of machine learning techniques to the classification of CYP inhibitors. Such classification models are important for the prediction of drug drug interactions. In this work, we present which cyp a publically available software and web server for prediction of CYP inhibitors built from these data.

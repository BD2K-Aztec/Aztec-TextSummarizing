Motivation: Upgrade and integration of triplex software into the r bioconductor framework. Results: We combined a previously published implementation of a trip-lex DNA search algorithm with visualization to create a versatile r bioconductor package triplex. The new package provides functions that can be used to search Bioconductor genomes and other DNA sequence data for occurrence of nucleotide patterns capable of forming intramolecular triplexes h dna. Functions producing 2D and 3D diagrams of the identified triplexes allow instant visualization of the search results. Leveraging the power of bio strings and GRanges classes, the results get fully integrated into the existing Bioconductor framework, allowing their passage to other Genome visualization and annotation packages, such as genome graphs r track layer or g viz. Availability: R package triplex is available from Bioconductor

introduction dna sequence analysis and annotation are important steps in uncovering the molecular basis of life. Although protein coding sequences have been intensively studied in the past, recent focus has shifted toward the less known biological functions encoded in intergenic DNA, as well as the study of structural and regulatory aspects of genetic information packaging in chromosomes. Tools for the necessary sequence analysis of non-coding sequences are less common than their gene centered counterparts. We have recently formulated and implemented an algorithm to detect potential triplex forming sequences in genomes (). Such sequences have been implicated as important players in several key processes, such as transcriptional regulation () or DNA recombination (). Triplex DNA forms when a third strand of nucleotides is allowed to align with a watson crick duplex using hoogste en

Motivation: Fronto-temporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also called motor neuron disease, MND) are severe neurodegenerative diseases that show considerable overlap at the clinical and cellular level. The most common single mutation in families with FTD or ALS has recently been mapped to a non-coding repeat expansion in the uncharacterized gene C9ORF72. Although a plausible mechanism for disease is that aberrant C9ORF72 mRNA poisons splicing, it is important to determine the cellular function of C9ORF72, about which nothing is known. Results: Sensitive homology searches showed that C9ORF72 is a full length distant homologue of proteins related to Differentially Expressed in Normal and Neoplasia (DENN), which is a gdp gtp exchange factor (GEF) that activates rab gtpases. Our results suggest that C9ORF72 is likely to regulate membrane traffic in conjunction with rab gtpase switches, and we propose to name the gene and its product denn like 72 (DENNL72).

introduction frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are major neurodegenerative diseases that occur in sporadic and familial forms, which show overlap in clinical presentation and cytopathology (). The commonest cause of familial ALS, accounting for 2040%, maps to a mutation in the gene C9ORF72 at 9p21 (). Mutation of C9ORF72 is also common in patients with familial FTD (1030%), sporadic FTD (210%) and alzheimer like dementia (04%) (). A single mutation is found: a massively expanded ggg gcc hexa nucleotide repeat in an intronic portion of the 5 0 untranslated region. In the general population, alleles have a median of two repeats (range: 022), which are expanded in pathogenic alleles to 41000 repeats. The pathogenetic mechanism is unknown, but other neurological syndromes arise from non-coding expansions. Pathology could occur via poisoning of splicing factors, in particular TDP-43, with non-coding repeats inducing toxic RNA foci that sequester splicing factors and other nuclear proteins (), as in Fragile X Tremor Ataxia Syndrome fxt as and myotonic dystrophy. TDP-43 deposits and aberrant cytoplasmic mRNA foci in C9ORF72 mutant cells both support a role for splicing (). However, these are not universal findings (), and alternative mechanisms should be considered. One possibility is that the expansion reduces translation, as in Fragile X, consistent with reduced levels of C9ORF72 protein in mutant cells (). Despite its clinical relevance, the normal function of the C9ORF72 protein has remained obscure. A powerful way to determine protein function is to find homologies to proteins of known function. The sensitivity of the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) has been increased in several ways. position specific iterative (PSI)BLAST creates a profile of key residues from BLAST, and then searches with increasingly large profiles to converge on a final stable alignment (). Sensitivity is improved by profileprofile comparison, using profiles for every database entry (). Because structure diverges far slower than primary sequence (), a further enhancement is to include secondary structural prediction in all profiles. The tool hhp red allocates 15% of the profile weighting at each residue to predicted structure: helix sheet or loop. Importantly, hhp red searches targets not only in the Protein Database (PDB) of solved structures, other databases of domains, but also through proteome wide libraries of model eukaryotes. Its enhanced profileprofile searches can find homologues that lack significant amino acid conservation even where no structure is solved, and no domain recognized (). DENN domain proteins (standing for 'differentially expressed in normal and neoplastic cells') are highly conserved rab gef s with large numbers of homologues in some species: humans have 16 in 7 subgroups (). Using PSI-BLAST, several denn like families have been identified: DENND6 (FAM116), AVL9, Fam45A, l chn Afi1p and Anr2p, some of which have gdp gtp exchange factor (GEF) activity (). All denn like proteins contain a domain of 400500 aa (), the structure of which consists of two lobes that associate intimately with each other and Rab. The tripartite 'domains' of u denn c denn and d denn previously identified in silico had no *To whom correspondence should be addressed.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press.

The c terminal domain makes 16 of 21 Rab contacts, and this lobe is the active GEF. The n terminal lobe of denn s adopts a long in domain (LD) fold, also found in SNAREs, small and medium coat subunits and three types of GEF: three components of the TRAPP complex, both of MON1/CCZ1 and fuzzy (FUZ) (). LDs, particularly as dimers, are highly conserved platforms for GTPases, deriving from their circularly permuted ancestral roadblock domain, found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (). Recently folli culin fl cn a tumour suppressor mutated in birth ogg dube syndrome dube syndrome leading to renal cancers, which had no homologies according to PSI-BLAST, was identified as a structural and functional homologue of DENN (). Thus, DENN is the founder of a family that is wider than can be appreciated using PSI-BLAST. Here, we show that C9ORF72 is one of several previously unrecognized full length homologues of DENN proteins, suggesting that C9ORF72 is a member of the denn like superfamily, and hence a regulator of membrane traffic.

discussion we have found strong structural homology between C9ORF72 and full length GEF domains in the denn like superfamily. At its n terminus C9ORF72 is most related to LCHN/AVL9. At its c terminus C9ORF72 aligns very well with f nip which shows strong homology to DENN and fl cn. Independent of hhp red multiple independent structural prediction engines suggested DENN as a possible homologue of C9ORF72, despite only two DENN structures being solved to date. As a benchmark to gauge the strength of the matches we obtain, they have higher scores than the matches between denn s and fl cn. In the future, our prediction can be verified in ways that have been applied to fl cn solving the structure, and showing GEF activity of purified protein. Our predictions would be helped by including data on the rab binding site. However, the lack of conservation of any potential rab binding residues between DENND1B and fl cn () suggests that it is unlikely that C9ORF72 shares these residues. Because at least one denn like protein (Afi1p in budding yeast) binds an Arf GTPase (), it is not certain). Solid arrows join elements aligned by hhp red and other alignments were made by hand (dashed arrows). Variations in C9ORF72 are indicated by numbers above. Large brackets indicate the extent of match between C9ORF72 and AVL9 (i) initially and (ii) in the reverse search. Insertions are indicated by the number of residues, except for '', indicating a loop of 130 aa in human AVL9. (B) Cluster map of the denn like superfamily. 306 diverse members of 11 sub-families of denn like proteins, excluding LD only NPRL2/3s, were tested for all versus all similarity (10 iterations of PSI-BLAST), and clustered by CLANS (). All pairs with similarity threshold P 10 25 are joined by lines, which are darker and shorter with greater similarity. Sub-families are identified by colour. Outlier organisms (Trichomonas and Entamoeba) are identified by shape. thirty one colicin s included as negative controls showed no links to the other sequences (data not shown)

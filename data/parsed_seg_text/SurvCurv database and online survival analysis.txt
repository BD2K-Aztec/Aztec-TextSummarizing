Understanding the biology of ageing is an important and complex challenge. Survival experiments are one of the primary approaches for measuring changes in ageing. Here, we present a major update to surv curv a database and online resource for survival data in animals. As well as a substantial increase in data and additions to existing graphical and statistical survival analysis features, surv curv now includes extended mathematical mortality modelling functions and survival density plots for more advanced representation of groups of survival cohorts. Availability and implementation: The database is freely available at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/SurvCurv/. All data are published under the Creative Commons Attribution License.

introduction the biological phenomenon of ageing has been a long standing area of research (). Despite identification of many gene knock-outs, drug administration and environmental regimes that can extend lifespan of model organisms under laboratory conditions, many questions remain unresolved (). A key experimental approach in research on ageing is to use longevity survival experiments, which usually characterize differences with respect to ageing between populations when other causes of death, such as predators, food competition and pathogens, are excluded. Until recently, numerical data from animal survival experiments were usually not shared, and the data were analysed only in the original study, hampering method development, re-analysis of existing data by new methods, meta analyses combining data and systems biology approaches. We have created the surv curv database and online analysis platform for animal survival data (). Here, we present a major surv curv update, comprising improvements and new analysis features as well as increased data content.

description surv curv is a database and analysis platform accessible through its user friendly web interface at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/ databases surv curv. The main website gives access to the database through a search box, querying the manually curated annotations of experimental conditions and treatments. Annotations use existing databases and ontologies, where possible, and advanced searches using specific database fields are available. All data from the database can be analysed online and additional user data can be analysed

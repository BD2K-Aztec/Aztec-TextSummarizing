circular ized Chromosome Conformation Capture followed by deep sequencing (4C-Seq) is a powerful technique to identify genome wide partners interacting with a pre-specified genomic locus. Here, we present a computational and statistical approach to analyze 4C-Seq data generated from both enzyme digestion and sonication fragmentation based methods. We implemented a command line software tool and a web interface called w4CSeq, which takes in the raw 4C sequencing data fast q files) as input, performs automated statistical analysis and presents results in a user friendly manner. Besides providing users with the list of candidate interacting sites regions w4CSeq generates figures showing genome wide distribution of interacting regions, and sketches the enrichment of key features such as tss s TTSs, CpG sites and DNA replication timing around 4C sites. Availability and Implementation: Users can establish their own web server by downloading source codes at https://github.com/WGLab/w4CSeq. Additionally, a demo web server is available at http://

introduction with the development of microscopy and genomic technologies, it has been shown that three dimensional genome architecture within nucleus tremendously affects gene function and cell property (). The underlying component of genome architecture is chromatin interactions that occur at the genome wide scale. The specific long range genomic segments contacts are achieved by chromatin looping and usually mediated by transcription factors. Most of the interactions are between enhancer and promoter, leading to well regulated gene expression patterns (). Originated from 3C (chromosome conformation capture) (), 4C-Seq (van de) is specifically developed to assess the long range dna dna interactions where one of the DNA segments is the locus of present a web application named w4CSeq, and show the results generated with w4CSeq by analyzing real biological datasets.

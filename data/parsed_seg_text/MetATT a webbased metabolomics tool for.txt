time series and multifactor studies have become increasingly common in meta bolo mic studies. Common tasks for analyzing data from these relatively complex experiments include identification of major variations associated with each experimental factor, comparison of temporal profiles across different biological conditions, as well as detection and validation of the presence of interactions. Here we introduce met att a web based tool for time series and two factor meta bolo mic data analysis. met att offers a number of complementary approaches including 3D interactive principal component analysis, two way heat map visualization, two way ANOVA, anova simultaneous component analysis and multivariate empirical Bayes time series analysis. These procedures are presented through an intuitive web interface. At the end of each session, a detailed analysis report is generated to facilitate understanding of the results.

introduction metabolomics involves the study of multiple small molecule compounds in a biological system. bio fluids (i.e. urine, blood) are by far the most commonly used sample type in meta bolo mic studies. These samples can be collected conveniently and relatively non-invasively, and are often used in longitudinal studies such as monitoring disease progression, tracking nutritional interventions or observing drug toxicity. bio fluids have also been increasingly used in cross sectional studies for biomarker discovery. One important lesson learned from these studies is that metabolic profiles of many bio fluids are very sensitive to multiple factors such as diet, age, gender, etc. (). Therefore, one often needs to consider other factors together with the biological condition of interest during data analysis. Specially designed statistical approaches have been developed to deal with the multifactor issues as well as for time series studies, such as parallel factor analysis para fac (), anova simultaneous component analysis (ASCA) (), multivariate empirical Bayes time series analysis (MEBA) () and multivariate multiway analysis of multisource data (). However, most of

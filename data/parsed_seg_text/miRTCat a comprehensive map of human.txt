MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate various biological functions by binding hundreds of transcripts to impart post-transcriptional repression. Recently, by applying a transcriptome wide experimental method for identifying miRNA target sites (Ago hits clip a novel non-canonical target site, named nucleation bulge, was discovered as widespread, functional and evolution ally conserved. Although such non-canonical nucleation bulges have been proven to be predictive by using pivot pairing rule and sequence conservation, this approach has not been applied yet. To facilitate the functional studies of non-canonical miRNA targets, we implement mirt cat a comprehensive searchable map of miRNA target sites, including non-canonical nucle-ation bulges, not only mapped in experimentally verified mirna bound regions but also predicted in all 3 0 untranslated regions (3 0-UTRs) derived from human and mouse ($15.6% as expected false positive results).

introduction micrornas (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules ($22 nt) that induce post-transcriptional repression of messenger RNAs (mRNAs), affecting various biological phenotypes (). Animal miRNAs typically recognize mRNA targets through imperfect matches, making the problem of predicting miRNA target sites challenging. Among these partial pairings, it is well known that miRNAs bind canonical miRNA target sites through short consecutive pairings with their seed regions (position 28; called 'seed pairing rule') (). Besides sequence complementarity, evolution al conservation has been considered, improving the performance of miRNA target predictions (). However, a critical caveat of all seed centric approaches is its inability to identify non-canonical miRNA target sites (), overlooking priori recognized non-canonical target sites validated as functionally important (). Recently, by applying cross-linking immunoprecipitation method (CLIP) coupled with high throughput sequencing (HITS) () to a protein called argonaut e (Ago hits clip all mirna binding regions in target mRNAs were experimentally mapped in high resolution (). However, not all mirna bound regions could be explained by the canonical seed pairing rule, implicating existence of non-canonical mirna target interactions. By performing bioinformatic analyses in such orphan regions, non-canonical sites called 'nucleation bulges' were identified and validated as widespread, functional and evolution ally conserved (). Non-canonical nucleation bulge sites are predictable, as the mode of their interactions is generalized by 'pivot pairing rule', dictating a nucleotide in bulge (position 5 and 6) to be competent to pair with a nucleotide in position six of a miRNA, named 'pivot' to confer the thermodynamic stability on consecutive five base pairings (position 26, Supplementary). Such initial five base pairings are proposed to be served as nuclei of interactions (nucleation), followed by bulge formation where originally matched pivot nucleotide in position six becomes bulged out and propagating hybridization toward 3 0-end of the miRNA. However, such a rule based on a pivot pairing has not been applied for miRNA target prediction yet. To offer opportunities of studying non-canonical miRNA targets, here we describe miRNA target maps specialized for nucleation bulge sites, named mirt cat. mirt cat provides comprehensive maps searchable for miRNA target sites including non-canonical nucleation bulges, of which locations are not only predicted in all 3 0 untranslated regions (3 0-UTRs; annotated by RefSeq in human and mouse) but also mapped in mirna bound regions that are experimentally verified (). Such functionalities will aid to generate hypothesis starting from interactions between miRNA and non-canonical targets.

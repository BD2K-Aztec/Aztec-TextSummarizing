Motivation: Recent progress in live cell imaging and modeling techniques has resulted in generation of a large amount of quantitative data (from experimental measurements and computer simulations) on spatiotemporal dynamics of biological objects such as molecules, cells and organisms. Although many research groups have independently dedicated their efforts to developing software tools for visualizing and analyzing these data, these tools are often not compatible with each other because of different data formats. Results: We developed an open unified format, Biological Dynamics Markup Language bd ml current version: 0.2), which provides a basic framework for representing quantitative biological dynamics data for objects ranging from molecules to cells to organisms. bd ml is based on Extensible Markup Language (XML). Its advantages are machine and human readability and exten-sibility. bd ml will improve the efficiency of development and evaluation of software tools for data visualization and analysis. Availability and implementation: A specification and a schema file for bd ml are freely available online at

introduction with the rapid progress in live cell imaging and modeling techniques, quantitative spatiotemporal dynamics of biological objects such as molecules, cells and organisms can be obtained from experimental measurements and computer simulations (). Such quantitative data can provide us with new opportunities to analyze biological dynamics through various types of computational methods; these data would also provide a rich resource for understanding the mechanisms of biological systems. A wide variety of quantitative biological dynamics data can be directly obtained from experimental measurements by using live cell imaging and digital image processing; for example, cell division dynamics in Caenorhabditis elegans can be extracted from four dimensional (4D) microscopic images (). Similarly, quantitative data can be obtained for embryogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster () and zebrafish () and for behavioral dynamics in adult c elegans (). Quantitative data can also be obtained from computer simulations, e.g. single molecule dynamics in Escherichia coli () and microtubule dependent nuclear dynamics in c elegans embryos (). Although most of these data are publicly available, it is often difficult to reuse them because of their intricate structure and the lack of detailed explanations of their formats.

discussion bd ml is an open xml based format for representing quantitative biological dynamics data. Although the five entity types used to describe dynamic spatial information (a set of points, a set of lines, a circle, a sphere and a set of faces) cover most of the publicly available data, other types of spatial entities (such as a cube or cylinder) can be potentially used. bd ml can easily support these types of spatial entities by extending its format using XML with reference to geometric primitives commonly used in computer graphics such as X3D (). bd ml provides a medium for representing a wide variety of quantitative data. Nearly 300 bd ml datasets are currently available online at the Systems Science of Biological Dynamics ssb d database (http://ssbd.qbic.riken.jp). These datasets include dynamics of molecules, cells (nuclei) and gene expression and dynamics of whole organisms such as E.coli, c elegans d melanogaster and zebrafish. Some of these datasets were derived from experimental measurements, whereas others were produced by computer simulation. bd ml enables us to represent various types and scales of biological dynamics for different species. Taking advantage of the bd ml format, we developed and released bdml4d viewer for visualizing quantitative data from the open source libraries and APIs. We are also developing software. An example of cell division dynamics in a c elegans embryo. Each nucleus is represented as a set of closed curves. In this example, the units are in micrometers, and the scale factors for the x, y and z dimensions are defined separately in the scale unit as 0.105, 0.105 and 0.5, respectively. An example of dynamics of nuclear migration in a c elegans embryo. The pro nucleus and microtubules are represented as a sphere and a set of line segments, respectively (A). These structures can be represented as either one component (B) or as separate components (C). In this example, the units are in meters and the scale factors for the x, y and z dimensions are set to 1.0 tools for extracting phenotypic characteristics from the data in the bd ml format. Several of these tools are already available online at http://ssbd.qbic.riken.jp/phenochar/. The development of these software tools further demonstrates the flexibility of using bd ml for visualization and analysis of different types of quantitative data. In addition, we believe that the bd ml format would provide new opportunities for scientists in other fields such as statistics, physics and information science and facilitate bringing new ideas and approaches to biological analysis. Besides its advantage as a human readable structured data format, bd ml also inherits some of the weaknesses of XML (; http://lw3.hdfgroup.org/projects/nara/XML_and_ binary pdf. The numerical values of quantitative data are represented in bd ml as decimal numbers in ASCII format. When numbers in double precision floating point format are written into a bd ml file, storing the entire values may become impractical in terms of file size and file operations. Therefore, this representation method may result in truncation and loss of precision. bd ml is hierarchical in structure, making it difficult to randomly access the data. The repetitive use of markup tags also makes it less efficient in terms of disk storage space than other data formats (Lawrence, 2004). Opening or reading a bd ml file using a software program can be a problem when the file size becomes too large. As bd ml is a text based hierarchical data format, large memory and computational resources are needed to parse the data file. To solve this problem, we included the series element, which can be used to divide a dataset into more than one bd ml file. Using this element in the ssb d database enables practical use of the quantitative data for d melanogaster and zebrafish embryos as series of bd ml files. A more general solution to the above problems would be to use another approach such as the eXtensible Data Model and Format () or field ml (). In these formats, the description of the data (light data) is separate from the numerical values (heavy data). The light data and heavy data are often stored in XML and HDF5 formats, respectively. This approach ensures numerical precision and reduces the required disk storage space and computational resources but lacks human readability. We are planning to expand bd ml to also handle binary formatted data in the near future. Although the ontology element is optional in the current version of bd ml (0.2), it can provide unambiguous definitions of the terms in the bd ml file. As most biologists are not familiar with ontological terms, tools for helping them to annotate the data in ontological terms at the time of file creation would be needed to make the option compulsory. Moreover, meta-information definition can be provided in the annotation element of the bd base element by using the RDF. These definitions enable computer programs to understand the meaning of the terms and meta-information in the bd ml file. The ontological references and annotations can be attached when the data are registered in some repository databases, such as ssb d. A limitation of the current version of bd ml (0.2) is the lack of hierarchical representation of meta-information about genetic perturbations (e.g. mutants, gene editing and RNAi treatments) and chemical perturbations (e.g. drug treatments). Such information would be useful for systematic comparison and analysis of biological each nucleus is represented as a sphere, and total GFP signal is described in the property element. In this example, the units are in micrometers, and the scale factors for the x, y and z dimensions are defined separately in the scale unit as 0.9, 0.9 and 1.0, respectively. An example of behavioral dynamics of an adult c elegans represented as a set of line segments. In this example, the units are in micrometers and the scale factors for the x, y and z dimensions are defined separately in the scale unit as 4.1, 4.1 and 0, respectively snapshot of the bdml4d viewer software tool dynamics by using more than one bd ml file. Therefore, a future version of the bd ml format will extend the bd ml schema to support such information. As meta-information about genetic and chemical perturbations can be useful for other xml based data formats such as mini ml (), mzm l (), OME (), CellML (), SBML () and sbr ml (), we aim to collaborate with these projects to incorporate this information in a future release. Integration and comparative analysis of various types of quantitative data are straightforward when they are represented in the bd ml format. Such integration has the potential to lead to new insights into biological mechanisms; for example, an integrated study of the dynamics of cell morphology and protein activity has explored the relationship between biophysical phenomena and biochemical signaling (). Comparison of experimental measurements and computer simulations has elucidated the mechanisms of various kinds of biological dynamics (). bd ml will facilitate such comparative analysis and comparison of the data from different laboratories. We believe that the bd ml format will widen the range of scientific approaches to understanding biological systems.

In the context of meta genomics we introduce a new approach to protein database search called p aud a which runs $10 000 times faster than BLASTX, while achieving about one third of the assignment rate of reads to KEGG orthology groups, and producing gene and tax on abundance profiles that are highly correlated to those obtained with BLASTX. p aud a requires 580 CPU hours to analyze a dataset of 246 million Illumina DNA reads from permafrost soil for which a previous BLASTX analysis (on a subset of 176 million reads) reportedly required 800 000 CPU hours, leading to the same clustering of samples by functional profiles. Availability: p aud a is freely available from: http://ab.inf.uni-tuebin-gen.de/software/pauda. Also supplementary method details are available from this website.

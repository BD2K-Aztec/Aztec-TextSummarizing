Motivation: DNA methylation patterns are well known to vary substantially across cell types or tissues. Hence, existing normalization methods may not be optimal if they do not take this into account. We therefore present a new R package for normalization of data from the Illumina Infinium Human methylation 450 bead chip (Illumina 450 K) built on the concepts in the recently published fun norm method, and introducing cell type or tissue type flexibility. Results: fun too norm is relevant for data sets containing samples from two or more cell or tissue types. A visual display of cross validated errors informs the choice of the optimal number of

introduction recently a normalization method was introduced by fort in et al.). The percentile specific adjustments in fun norm are the key feature allowing batch effects and technical artefacts to have non-constant influence across the range of signal strengths. However, since methylation patterns may differ substantially across cell types or tissues leading to cell or tissue type specific quantiles, optimal normalization adjustments should capture this. Here we present an R package for normalization of Illumina 450 K data, fun too norm (an extension of the ideas in fun norm applicable to such heterogeneous data sets.

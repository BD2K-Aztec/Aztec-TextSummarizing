With the increasing availability of high density methylation microarrays, there has been growing interest in analysis of DNA methylation data. We have developed cpg assoc an R package that can efficiently perform the statistical analysis needed for increasingly large methylation datasets. cpg assoc is a modular, expandable package with functions to perform rapid analyses of DNA methylation data via fixed or mixed effects models, to perform basic quality control, to carry out permutation tests, and to display results via an array of publication quality plots.

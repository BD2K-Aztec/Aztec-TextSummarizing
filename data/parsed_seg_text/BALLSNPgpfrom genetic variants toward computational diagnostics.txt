In medical research, it is crucial to understand the functional consequences of genetic alterations, for example, non-synonymous single nucleotide variants nss nvs. nss nvs are known to be causative for several human diseases. However, the genetic basis of complex disorders such as diabetes or cancer comprises multiple factors. Methods to analyze putative synergetic effects of multiple such factors, however, are limited. Here, we concentrate on nss nvs and present balls n pgp a tool for structural and functional characterization of nss nvs which is aimed to improve pathogenicity assessment in computational diagnostics. Based on annotated SNV data, balls n pgp creates a three dimensional visualization of the encoded protein, collects available information from different resources concerning disease relevance and other functional annotations, performs cluster analysis, predicts putative binding pockets and provides data on known interaction sites. Availability and implementation: balls n pgp is based on the comprehensive C þþ framework Biochemical Algorithms Library (BALL) and its visualization front end ball view. Our tool is available at www ccb uni saarland de balls n pgp
introduction nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants nss nvs play a crucial role for understanding the genetic basis of many diseases, including diabetes and cancer. Over 85% of known nss nvs are currently associated with a specific disease. While the advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) increases the amount of identified nss nvs the experimental analysis of their pathogenic influence is laborious and time consuming (). Consequently, several approaches to predict the functional impact of nss nvs in silico have been developed. In a previous study, we evaluated the prediction concordance and congruency of 13 state of the art pathogenicity prediction tools (). To this end, we were able to address fundamental problems of current methods centering at the 'one SNV, one phenotype' paradigm. A human individual inherits several nss nvs simultaneously. These nss nv sets may exhibit synergistic effects and, thus, contribute to pathogenic phenotypes. Besides browser based tools such as mup it Interactive () providing three dimensional (3D) visualizations, computational methods to assess the impact of nss nv sets on a protein are missing in the first approach to analyze nss nv sets, we developed the proof of concept tool balls np () that visualizes mutated residues within 3D protein structures and provides available database annotations on clinical significance and disease association for them. Here we present balls n pgp which expands our previous tool to improve the assessment of pathogenic relevance in clinical diagnostics, especially when no 3D structural information is available. Based on NGS output that relies on the Variant Call Format and includes gene based annotation, balls n pgp searches for a 3D structure or a homologous 3D model and pathogenicity information in available databases, predicts pathogenicity, protein stability changes and active sites, performs cluster analyses on mutated residues and assigns protein interaction sites as annotated in pi site () on the residue level.

conclusion in this work, we present balls n pgp a software tool to analyze and identify nss nv candidates for computational diagnostics. It is based on a standard molecular modeling framework, allows the use of standard NGS output, embeds fundamental nss nv information and performs various analyses of the 3D structure of the mutated protein to gain insights into putative cumulative effects of nss nvs. The well defined user interface and the clear presentation of the generated information are appealing to non expert users, as well as bioinformatics professionals. In the future, balls n pgp will be extended to include the possibility to analyze binding of the affected protein to its interaction partners and small molecules to facilitate drug design studies.

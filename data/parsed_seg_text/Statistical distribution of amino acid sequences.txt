Motivation: The article presents results of the listing of the quantity of amino acids, dipeptides and tri peptides for all proteins available in the uniprot trembl database and the listing for selected species and enzymes. uniprot trembl contains protein sequences associated with computationally generated annotations and large scale functional characterization. Due to the distinct metabolic pathways of amino acid syntheses and their physicochemical properties, the quantities of sub peptides in proteins vary. We have proved that the distribution of amino acids, dipeptides and tri peptides is statistical which confirms that the evolutionary biodiversity development model is subject to the theory of independent events. It seems interesting that certain short peptide combinations occur relatively rarely or even not at all. First, it confirms the Darwinian theory of evolution and second, it opens up opportunities for designing pharmaceuticals among rarely represented short peptide combinations. Furthermore, an innovative approach to the mass analysis of bioinformatic data is presented.

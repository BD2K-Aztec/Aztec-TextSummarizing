Motivation: Increased availability of various genotyping techniques has initiated a race for finding genetic markers that can be used in diagnostics and personalized medicine. Although many genetic risk factors are known, key causes of common diseases with complex heritage patterns are still unknown. Identification of such complex traits requires a targeted study over a large collection of data. Ideally, such studies bring together data from many bio banks. However, data aggregation on such a large scale raises many privacy issues. Results: We show how to conduct such studies without violating privacy of individual donors and without leaking the data to third parties. The presented solution has provable security guarantees.

introduction genome wide association studies g was are one of the driving reasons behind the formation of nationwide and privately funded gene banks. Many chronic diseases and various cancer types are known to have genetic disposition factors (). Although many underlying genetic signatures have been successfully identified for Mendelian disorders (), not many genetic risk factors for complex diseases have been discovered and confirmed. g was have identified some risk factors for type II diabetes () and for a few other common diseases (). g was have been modestly successful in pharmacogenetics () and cancer research (). The size and structure of a study cohort are the main limiting factors in such studies, as the individual impact of genomic differences is usually small. Larger sample sizes increase the sensitivity of statistical tests and make it possible to apply a wide range of data mining methods (). Ideally, studies should use nationwide and continent wide patient cohorts. Formation of such cohorts is becoming feasible as genotyping costs are rapidly decreasing (). In addition to nationwide bio banks e.g. the UK Biobank, several personal genomics companies, such as 23andMe and navi genic s already possess large and diverse patient cohorts. bio banks are also forming large collaboration networks, such as P3G and huge net to combine their patient cohorts and improve study quality. Privacy of individual gene donors is one of the biggest concerns in such projects. In many countries, genotype data are classified as sensitive data that can be handled by complying with specific restrictions, e.g. HIPAA in the USA and the Data Protection Directive in the European Union. These restrictions are justified, as a leak of genetic information can cause genome based discrimination when more health related patterns have been discovered. Standard anonymization methods are not applicable to genotype data, as the data themselves are an ultimate identity code. Only 3080 out of 30 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are needed to uniquely identify a person (). Moreover, the size of online genotype databases for genealogy studies, such as s gmf and y hrd has made re identification of anonymized genotype data a real threat (). re identification attacks () based on combining inferred phenotypes with public data become practical, as the list of known associations between genotype and phenotypic traits () evolves. finally showed that even aggregated pools of genomic data can leak private information. Although follow-up studies () softened initial claims, the threat remains. These findings created a debate whether one can promise privacy of genotype data in consent forms at all (P3G). In the following, we show how to set up an infrastructure where the genotype data can be stored and processed so that none of the peers involved in the process can reconstruct the data, and thus the risk of accidental leaks and malicious data abuse is greatly reduced. The data analysis algorithms are executed in an oblivious manner so that only the desired outcome is revealed to the user and nothing else. Differently from well known data perturbation and masking techniques (), security guarantees are cryptographic. These guarantees depend on the computational complexity of well established mathematical problems and not on the background knowledge of potential attackers. As such, the presented methodology is applicable to protecting bio banks and other medical databases. *To whom correspondence should be addressed.  The Author 2013.

discussion although the results prove the practical feasibility of cryptographically secure g was the solution is also notably more resource demanding than the alternatives. We have to analyze further whether potential benefits outweigh costs. We consider three potential application scenarios and contrast our approach with the alternatives.

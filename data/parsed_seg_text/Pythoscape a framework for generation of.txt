pytho scape is a framework implemented in Python for processing large protein similarity networks for visualization in other software packages. Protein similarity networks are graphical representations of sequence, structural and other similarities among proteins for which pairwise all by all similarity connections have been calculated. Mapping of biological and other information to network nodes or edges enables hypothesis creation about sequence structure function relationships across sets of related proteins. pytho scape provides several options to calculate pairwise similarities for input sequences or structures, applies filters to network edges and defines sets of similar nodes and their associated data as single nodes (termed representative nodes) for compression of network information and output data or formatted files for visualization.

introduction the rapid growth of databases of protein information (e.g. sequences and structures) provides both new opportunities and challenges for analysis and clustering by similarity. For example, global analysis of entire superfamilies and association of their members with biological information and other types of metadata has become a useful tool for functional annotation and discovery (). As these sets become larger (sometimes many thousands of sequences) and their members more divergent, their fast exploration on a large scale becomes less feasible using traditional approaches such as alignments and trees. Protein similarity networks (PSNs) enable analysis and visualization of structure function relationships in large protein data sets by clustering of individual protein sets for more complex analysis while summarizing 'connectivity' relationships among the clusters. Mapping orthogonal sources of biological information onto PSNs then provides a powerful way to view functional trends across the set that can be interpreted in the context of their similarities. (for an initial analysis of some uses and statistical validation of PSNs.) While databases like Similarity Matrix of Proteins (SIMAP) () store pairwise similarities, and plug-ins available with software such as Cytoscape () allow creation of small PSNs (), no software solution exists to create and manage large PSNs. And while PSNs are inherently amenable to association with orthogonal information sources, the many information types available complicate development of a single software solution for managing such diverse features. pytho scape addresses these issues and provides a software framework to create PSNs and develop new analyses for inference of functional properties in proteins this is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/), which permits unrestricted, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. thousands of GSTs that have been identified, the physiological substrates of only a small proportion are known; thus, they are principally classified into putative functional classes according to enzymatic, structural, and other features (). Recently, PSNs have been used to summarize and guide a global interpretation of GST sequence and structure relationships (). A PSN of GST sequences is shown in see supplementary information for network creation and graph statistics). It illustrates how representative nodes computed by pytho scape enable analysis of PSNs too large to be visualized in total while retaining their value for developing hypotheses from sequence similarities across the whole set. For comparison, individual clusters of interest can be outputted with all nodes present (). This full non abstracted network (representing a node for each sequence) shows a similar pattern of relationships to those shown in the corresponding representative node network (boxed in). The correlation between the ideal representative node mean distances calculated in pytho scape and the corresponding full network ideal distance for is provided in Supplementary. A quantitative description of the relationships between filtered networks and full networks has also recently been described elsewhere for some example systems (), but these differences appear also to depend on the specific system analyzed. While 'missing data' is an inherent feature of representative nodes, the trade-off is in visualizing similarity relationships across large datasets that would not be practically achievable because of memory and speed limitations in their calculation. The network shown in demonstrates another issue in the use of representative nodes that could complicate interpreting relationships between functional features and sequence similarity. In the example given here, some GST families are represented by multiple representative nodes, whereas other representative nodes contain multiple SwissProt families (HSP26, Phi and Tau), obscuring how sequence similarity tracks with annotation. Thus, we recommend that analysis using representative networks be accompanied by examination of the relevant parts of the corresponding full networks.

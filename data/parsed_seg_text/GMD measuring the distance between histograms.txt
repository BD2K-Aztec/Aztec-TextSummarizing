GMD (generalized minimum distance of distributions) is an R package to assess the similarity between spatial distributions of read based sequencing data such as chips eq and rnase q. GMD calculates the optimal distance between pairs of normalized signal distributions, optionally sliding one distribution over the other to align the distributions. GMD also provides graphical and downstream clustering tools. Availability: The R package GMD source code is available at http:// cran r project org web packages gmd under GPL license Contact:

introduction high throughput DNA sequencers are now a cornerstone in genomics and can be used for inferring expression, splicing and non-coding isoforms rnase q transcription start sites tss s (CAGE), transcription factor binding sites, chromatin status chips eq and more. Aside from typical tasks of read mapping aligning to a reference or de novo assembling, differential expression, counting and peak calling, variant and mutation calling, comparing the distributions of DNA reads between different genomic loci or between different biological features (e.g. histone modifications) is also often meaningful. This is because the spatial distributions of such reads often indicate biological features; for example, chips eq experiments targeting H3K4me3 histone modifications often aggregate in characteristic double peaks around tss s while the H3K36me3 mark increase from TSS to termination site (). Similar examples exist for TSS () and small RNA data (). To do this systematically, a measure of similarity between distributions is necessary. Such measures should ideally be true metrics, have as few parameters as possible, be computationally efficient and also make biological sense to end users. Here, we present such a measure, generalized minimum distance of distributions (GMD), based on mdp a (minimum difference of pair assignment,). It can compare two empirical distributions of categorical data, which we refer as histograms (Supplementary Material). Considering two normalized histograms * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

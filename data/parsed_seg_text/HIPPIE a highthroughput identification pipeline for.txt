We implemented a high throughput identification pipeline for promoter interacting en-hancer element to streamline the workflow from mapping raw Hi-C reads, identifying dna dna interacting fragments with high confidence and quality control, detecting histone modifications and DNase hypersensitive enrichments in putative enhancer elements, to ultimately extracting possible intra and inter chromosomal enhancer target gene relationships.

introduction genome wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) has been utilized to reveal three dimensional connectivity of chromatin regions in eukaryotic nuclei (). Because of its capability to capture all possible chromatin interactions in a genome, it has been recently employed to observe long range regulatory elements with their geographically proximal target gene promoters (). Although there have been workflows successfully expediting the analysis of one dimensional high throughput sequencing results such as whole exo me sequencing, chips eq dnase seq and rnase q there are limited tools to untangle two dimensional dna dna physical interactions using Hi-C datasets. In an effort to reduce the obstacle of processing these large scale datasets and to establish an analysis protocol to detect candidate long range regulatory elements, we implemented an automated workflow that processes Hi-C results starting from read mapping with quality controls and corrects for biases in interactions based on the linear distance, mapp ability GC content and fragment lengths of each pair of Hi-C reads. This pipeline identifies candidate promoter interacting enhancer elements by integrating Hi-C results with epi genomics data such as histone modifications and DNase hypersensitivity sites.

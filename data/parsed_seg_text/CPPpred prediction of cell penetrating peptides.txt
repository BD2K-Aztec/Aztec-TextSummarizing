Cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) are attracting much attention as a means of overcoming the inherently poor cellular uptake of various bioactive molecules. Here, we introduce cpp pred a web server for the prediction of CPPs using a N-to-1 neural network. The server takes one or more peptide sequences, between 5 and 30 amino acids in length, as input and returns a prediction of how likely each peptide is to be cell penetrating. cpp pred was developed with redundancy reduced training and test sets, offering an advantage over the only other currently available CPP prediction method. Availability and Implementation: cpp pred is freely available to non-commercial users at

introduction cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) demonstrate the ability to pass through cellular membranes. Accordingly, CPPs are emerging as potential tools for aiding the transport of therapeutic molecules that are not inherently bioavailable, and moreover as possible bioactive agents in their own right (). Although a number of broad classification systems for CPPs have been proposed (), in general, CPPs are typified by a length of 530 amino acids, an enrichment in basic residues, therefore a net positive charge, and are hydrophobic in part (). Several in silico CPP prediction algorithms have been developed to facilitate high throughput screening of peptides. Initially, methods focused on the use of scales of chemical properties, known as z descriptors (), for the prediction of CPPs (). Other approaches applied to CPP prediction include quantitative structure activity relationship models () and support vector machines (), although only one of these methods, cell ppd (), is publicly available. Here, we present cpp pred a CPP prediction method that uses a neural network (NN) approach. Although others have previously applied NN techniques to the prediction of CPPs (), cpp pred represents the only publicly available nn based method.

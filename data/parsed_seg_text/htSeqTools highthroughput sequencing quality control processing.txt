We provide a Bioconductor package with quality assessment, processing and visualization tools for high throughput sequencing data, with emphasis in chips eq and rnase q studies. It includes detection of outliers and biases, inefficient immuno-precipitation and over amplification artifacts, de novo identification of read rich genomic regions and visualization of the location and coverage of genomic region lists.

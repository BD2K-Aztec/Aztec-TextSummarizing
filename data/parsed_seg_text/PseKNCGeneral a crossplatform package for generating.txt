The avalanche of genomic sequences generated in the post genomic age requires efficient computational methods for rapidly and accurately identifying biological features from sequence information. Towards this goal, we developed a freely available and open source package, called p sek nc general (the general form of pseudo k tuple nucleotide composition), that allows for fast and accurate computation of all the widely used nucleotide structural and physicochemical properties of both DNA and RNA sequences. p sek nc general can generate several modes of pseudo nucleotide compositions, including conventional k tuple nucleotide compositions, moreau bro to autocorrelation coefficient, Moran autocorrelation coefficient , Geary autocorrelation coefficient, Type I p sek nc and Type II p sek nc. In every mode, 4100 physicochemical properties are available for choosing. Moreover, it is flexible enough to allow the users to calculate p sek nc with user defined properties. The package can be run on Linux, Mac and Windows systems and also provides a graph-ical user interface. Availability and implementation: The package is freely available at: http://

Automatic methods for macromolecular structure prediction (fold recognition, de novo folding and docking programs) produce large sets of alternative models. These large model sets often include many native like structures, which are often scored as false positives. Such native like models can be more easily identified based on data from experimental analyses used as structural restraints (e.g. identification of nearby residues by cross-linking, chemical modification, site directed mutagenesis, deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry, etc.). We present a simple server for scoring and ranking of models according to their agreement with user defined restraints.

introduction contemporary methods for modeling of macromolecular structures are generally incapable of producing a single, well defined confident model and instead generate numerous alternative conformations (called 'decoys' in folding or 'poses' in docking). Benchmarking experiments CASP and CAPRI have demonstrated that among sets of alternatives there are often models that somewhat resemble the native structure; however, current algorithms still have difficulty in identifying the correct solution from the list of false positives without additional data. It is known that the inclusion of sparse experimental data as spatial restraints can greatly improve the discrimination of near native protein structure models from alternative conformations. Structural features of proteins are commonly studied using low resolution methods. For example, functionally important residues that cluster together in space (such as the active sites) can be identified by

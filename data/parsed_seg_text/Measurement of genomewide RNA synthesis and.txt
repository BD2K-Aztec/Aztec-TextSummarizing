Standard transcript omics measures total cellular RNA levels. Our understanding of gene regulation would be greatly improved if we could measure RNA synthesis and decay rates on a genome wide level. To that end, the Dynamic Transcriptome Analysis (DTA) method has been developed. DTA combines metabolic RNA labeling with standard transcript omics to measure RNA synthesis and decay rates in a precise and non perturbing manner. Here, we present the open source r bioconductor software package DTA. It implements all required bioinformatics steps that allow the accurate absolute quantification and comparison of RNA turnover.

introduction total RNA levels are a consequence of RNA synthesis and decay. These individual contributions can be monitored by Dynamic Transcriptome Analysis (DTA,). DTA requires culturing cells in the presence of a labeling substrate (e.g. 4sU or 4tU). During a short, non perturbing RNA labeling pulse, cells incorporate 4tUTP into newly transcribed RNA instead of uridine. This setup yields three types of RNA fractions: total cellular RNA, newly transcribed labeled RNA and pre-existing unlabeled RNA. The quantification of these fractions on microarrays or by rnase q is used to estimate RNA synthesis and decay rates on a genome wide scale, assuming exponential decay. For each RNA g, the synthesis rate  g and the decay rate  g are estimated from the equations where t is the labeling duration, CCL the cell cycle length, and L g , U g , T g are the measurements of the labeled, unlabeled and total RNA fractions, respectively.  can be set to 0 in the case of primary cells (e.g. macrophages). It has been shown that DTA has higher sensitivity and higher temporal resolution in detecting gene regulatory changes than standard transcript omics * To whom correspondence should be addressed.(). One of the technical obstacles of standard transcript omics is the unknown normalization factor between samples, i.e. wild type and mutant cells. Variations in RNA extraction efficiencies and amplification steps in the biochemical protocol introduce differences in the global intensity levels. The estimation of the normalization factors limits the precision of DTA. We have extended DTA to comparative DTA cdt a to eliminate this obstacle (). cdt a allows for direct comparison of RNA synthesis and decay rates between samples. This is done by mixing an internal normalization standard of Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Sp) cells to samples of wild type or perturbed Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc) cells. Here, we present the r bioconductor package DTA. It implements all required methods to estimate RNA synthesis and decay rates from pre-processed microarray or rnase q measurements of any organisms that are obtained via the DTA or the cdt a protocol.

conclusion the DTA package delivers straightforward methods to estimate RNA synthesis and decay rates from pre-processed microarray or rnase q measurements that are obtained via the dta cdt a protocol. The DTA package fulfills the high standard of the Bioconductor platform, regarding documentation and usability. It can therefore be easily incorporated in R scripts for pre-processing and further statistical analysis of the results can readily be carried out by other methods within the r bioconductor programming environment.

Motivation: Automatic tracking of cells in multidimensional time-lapse fluorescence microscopy is an important task in many biomedical applications. A novel framework for objective evaluation of cell tracking algorithms has been established under the auspices of the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging 2013 Cell Tracking Challenge. In this article, we present the logistics, datasets, methods and results of the challenge and lay down the principles for future uses of this benchmark. Results: The main contributions of the challenge include the creation of a comprehensive video dataset repository and the definition of objective measures for comparison and ranking of the algorithms. With this benchmark, six algorithms covering a variety of segmentation and tracking paradigms have been compared and ranked based on their performance on both synthetic and real datasets. Given the diversity of the datasets, we do not declare a single winner of the challenge. Instead, we present and discuss the results for each individual dataset separately. Availability and implementation: The challenge Web site (http:// www code solorzano com cell tracking challenge provides access to the training and competition datasets, along with the ground truth of the training videos. It also provides access to Windows and Linux executable files of the evaluation software and most of the algorithms that competed in the challenge.

introduction cell migration is an essential process in normal tissue development, tissue repair and disease (). The dynamics of cell movement (e.g. speed, directionality) and migration type (i.e. the morphological changes that the cell undergoes during the movement) are closely related to the biomechanical properties of the surrounding environment (). Therefore, accurate quantification of both is the key to understanding the complex mechano biology of cell migration. Traditionally, cell migration experiments have been performed in two dimensions (2D) using phase or differential interference contrast microscopy. Nowadays, it is increasingly acknowledged that proper evaluation of the cellular movement, as well as related forces, requires looking at the cells in their three dimensional (3D) tissue environment (). This can be done by taking advantage of the versatility of fluorescence labeling and the optical sectioning capability of multidimensional fluorescence in vivo microscopy (). Fluorescence microscopy has several advantages (e.g. multi dimensionality specificity). However, tracking fluorescent cells poses specific challenges compared with more traditional phase contrast enhancing techniques: non homogenous staining, low signal to noise ratio, uneven background illumination, photobleaching, phototoxicity, etc. Moreover, an important challenge, specific to the use of green fluorescent protein (GFP) transfection based *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Therefore, tracking of fluorescent cells requires specialized tools. Several methods have been described for the segmentation of cells in static 3D fluorescence microscopy images (). These methods have been extended to account for the temporal variable in multidimensional timelapse microscopy, combining accurate segmentation of the cells with proper tracking of their movements and lineage events (e.g. apoptosis, mitosis, cell merging and overlapping). They can be classified into two broad categories: tracking by detection and tracking by model evolution (). In the former paradigm, cells are first detected in all the frames of the video independently using gradient features (), intensity () or wavelet decomposition (). Subsequently, an optimization strategy, such as multiple hypothesis tracking (), integer programming (), dynamic programming (Magnusson and j alden j alden 2012) or coupled minimum cost flow tracking (), is used to determine the most likely cell correspondence between frames. In the latter paradigm, cells are segmented and tracked simultaneously, using the final result of each frame as the initial condition for the analysis of the following frame. This is mostly done by evolving the contours of the cells, represented either parametrically () or implicitly (), using a velocity term defined by the content of the ''target'' frame (e.g. gradient features or intra and inter region heterogeneity) and by the internal properties of the evolved contours (e.g. mean curvature, shape or topology). The main benefit of the first paradigm is the mutual independence of detection and association steps, which allows straightforward tracking of new cells entering the field of view as well as forward backward spatiotemporal data association (). On the contrary, the tracking by model evolution approaches is popular for easy accommodation of morphological and behavioral clues into the model to inherently deal with the topologically flexible behavior of live cells. Bridging both paradigms together to take advantage of their benefits proposed a complex cell tracking system that combines a fast level set framework with a local spatiotemporal data association step. The tracking methods described until this date have been tested in one or few private datasets using different metrics and have seldom been compared against other algorithms. A noteworthy attempt toward a formalization of the evaluation of cell tracking algorithms was described by. They compared a novel cell tracking strategy to a publicly available probabilistic tracker using a customized tracking measurement and mostly publicly available data. similarly partly addressed this issue by providing a method for the validation of the accuracy of cell tracking results and a dataset composed of two manually annotated brightfield microscopy videos. Finally, two recent studies () presented two rigorous comparisons of algorithms developed for the segmentation of fluorescently labeled cells from static 2D images, using their own image repositories and adapted accuracy measures. The limitations of these studies, such as being mono modality using 2D or static images, one or two cell types only, or comparing with none or few competing algorithms, highlight the need for common standards to evaluate new and existing algorithms. Bearing this in mind, we organized the first Cell Tracking Challenge (http://www.codesolorzano.com/celltrackingchallenge) hosted by the 2013 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging is bi 2013, http://www.biomedicalimaging.org/2013/). In this article, we present the methods used in the challenge, briefly describe the competing algorithms and report on the results of the comparison, which was based on common accuracy measures and datasets covering a wide variety of scenarios of live cell imaging in fluorescence microscopy.

discussion in the next paragraphs, we will discuss the main contributions of the challenge. Datasets. We have created a public data repository composed of 24 annotated time-lapse sequences obtained from conventional and confocal fluorescence microscopes, along with 24 realistic computer simulations of moving nuclei. The cell types selected are relevant in the context of cell migration, being cells with stem like properties involved in embryonic and adult organ development and homeostasis, or cancer cell lines with metastatic properties. These videos cover a wide variety of cell types, microscopy and experimental setups, cell density and motility, resolution, image quality and dimensionality. There are 2D sequences of nu clearly stained cells, commonly used in cell population studies (e.g. N2DL-HeLa), and 3D sequences of cytoplasmic ally stained cells, more appropriate for single cell studies that demand a realistic rendering of the cellular environment (e.g. C3DL-MDA231). The characteristics of the videos in terms of contrast, resolution and signal to noise ratio are also diverse, covering conditions ranging from those that could be considered ''high quality'' (i.e. high numerical aperture lens, homogeneous and bright fluorescent staining) to conditions that could be classified as high throughput (i.e. low magnification, low numerical aperture lens, heterogeneous and dim fluorescent staining). All real videos used in the competition were manually annotated at three different sites, and a final ground truth per video was generated using a majority voting approach, to account for inter subject variability. The two additional simulated datasets provide an absolute ground truth for the comparison of the algorithms, eliminating the possible bias introduced by the annotators of the real videos. Measures and rankings. Key to the establishment of a credible benchmark is the use of common measures for algorithm evaluation and comparison. We have described and used measures that account for two aspects of the cell tracking problem: segmentation and tracking accuracy. The segmentation accuracy measure was based on the Jaccard similarity index, which evaluates how close the cell segmentations are to the ground truth. Tracking accuracy was evaluated using a novel measure, based on matching acyclic oriented graphs. This method automatically assesses the difficulty of transforming a computed graph into the ground truth reference. The difficulty is measured as the weighted sum of the least number of operations needed to make the graphs identical. Therefore, the tracking accuracy was measured by one comprehensive scalar measure, whereas in most previous works it required evaluating multiple measures to characterize various cell tracking events (). The weights are not biologically motivated; therefore, the measure is application independent. The highest weight is put on missing nodes in the weighted sum; therefore, the ability of the method to detect all the cells is important for achieving low score. Because both parameters (i.e. segmentation and tracking accuracy) are of similar importance, they were weighted equally in the final ranking function. Only when the algorithms achieved the same rank in terms of accuracy, the faster one was preferred, which was guaranteed by adding time performance with a smaller adaptive weight. Results: Participants and algorithms. Six algorithms were submitted to the first Cell Tracking Challenge, covering a wide variety of methods, stemming from the two main tracking paradigms: tracking by detection and tracking by model evolution. Most of the existing state of the art methods for filtering, enhancement, segmentation, particle analysis and track association are represented. Four of the six participating groups com us he idge kth se and prag cz provided results for all the datasets. This is a remarkable fact that emphasizes the generalization of the results. Results: Global analysis. Based on the numbers provided in Supplementary Table S1, both SEG and TRA accuracy measures were higher for nuclear labeling than for cytoplasmic labeling. Furthermore, they both reflected the level of complexity provided in, along with the description of the datasets. There were large differences in the segmentation accuracy, the lowest mean values being for C2DL-MSC and C3DL-MDA231 (both with cytoplasmic labeling), the highest mean value being for N3DH-CHO. This could be explained by the fact that the algorithms seem to be developed and tuned for the segmentation of nuclei, as they often incorporate cluster separation routines based on the circularity of segmented objects. Therefore, they are not appropriate for cellular shapes, which are seldom uniform, present protrusions and frequently establish contacts or overlaps. The TRA measure generally provided more uniform results among datasets, with the exception of C2DL-MSC. Interestingly, the algorithms achieved significantly higher tracking accuracy on the simulated datasets than on the real ones. This is likely because of the fact that the computer simulated nuclei are in general uniformly sized, and the simulated cell motility does not cover all possible random events that occur in real live cell experiments. Finally, the TIM measure strongly depended on the size of each video, being the lowest for C2DL-MSC and N2DH-SIM and the highest for N3DH-SIM and C3DH-H157. Another important factor influencing time consumption of the competing algorithms was the number of objects to be analyzed. Note that the standard deviations of the TIM measure indicate significant differences in the speed of competing algorithms for all the datasets. Results: Rankings. The FINAL ranking in shows that kth se performed best in four real datasets (C2DL-MSC, C3DL-MDA231, N2DH-GOWT1 and N2DL-HeLa). he idge and prag cz performed best in one real dataset (N3DHCHO and C3DH-H157, respectively). lei dnl performed best in the two simulated datasets (N2DH-SIM and N3DH-SIM). When we look at the number of appearances of each method among the top three best performing methods, both kth se and he idge appeared in all eight datasets, lei dnl and prag cz appeared in three datasets and finally up mes and com us appeared in one dataset. It is also important to note that in the case of C3DH-H157, N2DH-GOWT1, N2DL-HeLa and N3DH-SIM, the decisive factor for establishing the final ranking was the speed of competing algorithms because multiple methods were evenly ranked based on the SEG and TRA accuracy measures only. Looking at each accuracy measure separately, he idge and kth se ranked among the top three most accurate methods for all the datasets, with the exception of the segmentation accuracy for N3DH-CHO, where kth se ranked fourth. However, one should note that in this specific case, the difference in SEG between the most accurate method, he idge and kth se was small. The other two methods that often belonged to the top three most accurate methods were prag cz and lei dnl. In terms of TIM measure, com us prag cz and kth se were consistently the top three fastest methods for all the datasets. It is remarkable that kth se was, at worst, second fastest among the top three best performers in terms of SEG and TRA. Results per dataset: We will now look at the results of each particular dataset in detail, trying to extract relevant conclusions about the best performing methods see and Supplementary): C2DL-MSC (Supplementary Video S9). The accuracy measures were generally poor, especially because of problems with the segmentation of elongated protrusions, often incorrectly considered as whole cells. kth se achieved significantly better accuracy than the other methods because of the optimized track linking algorithm used, and an adaptive post-processing step, which merges segmented object portions into adjacent segments with tracks. Regardless of this additional post-processing step, the method was still fast, being the second fastest in terms of TIM and 42 faster than the other two top three best performing methods, he idge and up mes. C3DH-H157 (Supplementary Video S10). All the algorithms that competed for this dataset achieved comparable segmentation accuracy, he idge being the most accurate. Compared with the segmentation accuracy, the tracking accuracy was more spread out, prag cz being the most accurate. The decisive factor for establishing the final ranking of the top three best performing methods was TIM. Globally, prag cz was ranked first, having the lowest time consumption, namely, because the preprocessing step, involving Gaussian filtering, is applied only in 2D, slice by slice. C3DL-MDA231 (Supplementary Video S11). The calculated accuracy measures were generally poor, because of the

Retroviral integration has been implicated in several biomedical applications, including identification of cancer associated genes and malignant transformation in gene therapy clinical trials. We introduce an efficient and scalable method for fast identification of viral vector integration sites from long read high throughput sequencing. Individual sequence reads are masked to remove non genomic sequence, aligned to the host genome and assembled into contiguous fragments used to pinpoint the position of integration. Availability and Implementation: The method is implemented in a publicly accessible web server platform, seq map 2.0, containing analysis tools and both private and shared lab workspaces that facilitate collaboration among researchers.

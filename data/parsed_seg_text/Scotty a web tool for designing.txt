Motivation: A common question arises at the beginning of every experiment where rnase q is used to detect differential gene expression between two conditions: How many reads should we sequence? Results: Scotty is an interactive web based application that assists biologists to design an experiment with an appropriate sample size and read depth to satisfy the user defined experimental objectives.

introduction an experiment's power to detect differences in expression is based on its ability to distinguish true biological differences between conditions from the variability that occurs in repeated measurements of the same condition. In an rnase q experiment, this variability stems from three sources: biological variance, technical measurement imprecision and Poisson variance stemming from the inherent nature of counting experiments (Supplementary Section S1). These sources of variability lead to uncertainty about the gene's true average expression in each condition, limiting the resolution of the differences that can be detected as statistically significant. The uncertainty that is caused by biological and non poisson technical variance can be countered by increasing the number of biological replicates of each condition. Biological replicates are used because their measurements are subject to both. In contrast, Poisson uncertainty is reduced to the same degree if a fixed number of reads is used to either add more replicates or sequence the existing replicates more deeply (Supplementary Section S2,). Given a fixed number of reads, the most power will be achieved if these reads are used to sequence the highest number of biological replicates possible. However, biological material and library construction increase costs each time an additional replicate is added. Further, measuring a large fraction of the genes with low read counts can produce a dataset that is biased against identifying differentially expressed genes with low read counts because these genes will be measured with higher noise. We devised a simple web based tool, Scotty, which allows users to optimize the replicate number and read depth to maximize the statistical power achieved, while excluding configurations that require too many replicates, are too expensive, do not have sufficient power or result in datasets where large subsets of genes are measured with a high measurement bias. Scotty is similar in function to existing programs that are available for microarray experiments (), but is specifically adapted to rnase q. maximum power for each expression level as the percentage that would be expected to be detected if there were no Poisson noise. As read counts increase, power asymptotically approaches this maximum power. Under the default settings, the power difference metric is the percentage of measurements that are measured with 550% of maximum power. To test how well scotty s results can be generalized to other methods, we used simulation experiments to compare the power of a t test with the power of the de seq a statistical package whose approach shares information between genes to provide a better estimate of variance when it is poorly measured owing to low replicate number (). We found that while de seq has substantially higher power to detect differentially expressed genes when there are two replicates present the power of the two methods was similar when there were three or more replicates (Supplementary Section S6).

discussion while general guidance exists for biologists on designing rnase q experiments (), Scotty is, to our knowledge, the first interactive tool aiding rnase q experimental design. As the accuracy of scotty s projections is determined by the degree of similarity between the pilot and the main experiment, pilot data should be collected under conditions closely resembling the experimental conditions.

Ever larger phylogenies are being constructed due to the explosion of genetic data and development of high performance phylogenetic reconstruction algorithms. However, most methods for calculating divergence times are limited to datasets that are orders of magnitude smaller than recently published large phylogenies. Here, we present an algorithm and implementation of a divergence time method using penalized likelihood that can handle datasets of thousands of tax a. We implement a method that combines the standard derivative based optimization with a stochastic simulated annealing approach to overcome optimization challenges. We compare this approach with existing software including r8s, PATHd8 and BEAST.

introduction divergence times make phylogenetic hypotheses easier to interpret in light of other information on geology, biogeography and co diversification. A number of methods exist for transforming branch lengths to be proportional to time. However, many of these methods do not scale well for phylogenies with thousands of tax a. The number of species included in published phylogenies has exploded (). With the increase in the size of phylogenies, there is the need to develop divergence time methods that are capable of handling larger datasets. Here, we present a method, implemented in the software tree pl for calculating divergence time estimates using penalized likelihood () on large phylogenies. Penalized likelihood uses a semi-parametric approach that allows for different rates on different branches but has a smoothing parameter, set using cross validation that affects how much rate differences over the tree are penalized. Our approach attempts to overcome the problem of local minima, a problem amplified by including more tax a

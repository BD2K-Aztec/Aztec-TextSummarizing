We present LuciPHOr2, a site localization tool for generic post-translational modifications (PTMs) using tandem mass spectrometry data. As an extension of the original luci ph or (version 1) for phosphorylation site localization, the new software provides a site level localization score for generic PTMs and associated false discovery rate called the false localization rate. We describe several novel features such as operating system independence and reduced computation time through multiple threading. We also discuss optimal parameters for different types of data and illustrate the new tool on a human skeletal muscle dataset for lysine acetylation. Availability and implementation: The software is freely available on the SourceForge website

introduction posttranslational modifications (PTMs) induce conformational changes in proteins that influence their enzymatic activity, subcellular localization and or their binding affinity (). high throughput analysis of PTMs is typically achieved through mass spectrometry (MS) (), where tandem (MS/MS) mass spectra are searched against a sequence database allowing for PTMs. A major challenge in the interpretation of MS/MS data for PTMs is that database search engines can correctly match a peptide sequence with incorrectly localized PTM(s). These errors are not controlled by the type I error of peptide identification because each peptide has a different degree of uncertainty as far as site localization is concerned. For this reason, the conventional target decoy framework often leads to underestimation of the error rates for site localization of PTMs (). Hence, an additional procedure to control the number of false site localizations is necessary when reporting PTM localization analysis results at the proteome scale.

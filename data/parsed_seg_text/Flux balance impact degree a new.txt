Motivation: Metabolic pathways are complex systems of chemical reactions taking place in every living cell to degrade substrates and synthesize molecules needed for life. Modeling the robustness of these networks with respect to the dysfunction of one or several reactions is important to understand the basic principles of biological network organization, and to identify new drug targets. While several approaches have been proposed for that purpose, they are compu-tationally too intensive to analyze large networks, and do not properly handle reversible reactions. Results: We propose a new model the flux balance impact degreeâ€” to model the robustness of large metabolic networks with respect to gene knockout. We formulate the computation of the impact of one or several reaction blocking as linear programs, and propose efficient strategies to solve them. We show that the proposed method better predicts the phenotypic impact of single gene deletions on Escherichia coli than existing methods.

introduction metabolic pathways are complex systems of biochemical reactions taking place in every living cell to degrade substrates and synthesize molecules needed for life. Any metabolic dysfunction may lead to the impossibility to degrade or produce crucial molecules for the organism, potentially inducing disease or death. Yet cells seem to be able to maintain their normal functions despite many perturbations, such as the gene knock-out or DNA mutations perturbing the functions of proteins, while being sensitive to some specific attacks (). Understanding and modeling the organizational principles underlying the robustness of metabolic networks with respect to gene perturbations is important not only to shed light on basic principles of life, but also to identify weaknesses that may lead to new drug targets to kill pathogens or cancer cells (). Conceptually, a metabolic network can be considered as a network consisting of metabolites and enzyme gene catalyzed reactions that bridge these metabolites to transformation processes. A gene perturbation, such as knock-out or DNA mutation, can inhibit one or several reactions in a metabolic system. The impact of this perturbation on the cell phenotype can vary widely, ranging from no effect to cell death, depending on how many other reactions and crucial metabolites are impacted in cascade. Several approaches have been proposed to model and predict the phenotypic impact of inhibiting one or several genes through metabolic network perturbation. Flux balance analysis (FBA) is a constraint based mathematical model, which uses the stoichiometry of a given metabolic network along with a biologically relevant objective function to identify optimal reaction flux distributions (). It can be used to predict the effect of inhibiting one or several reactions by assessing how the objective function changes after the perturbation (). A related approach proposed by is the method of minimization of metabolic adjustment (MOMA), which predicts the flux vectors of gene knock-out mutants by imposing the constraint that mutants operate by minimizing their metabolic adjustment with respect to the wild type. Flux variability analysis (FVA) assesses the range of possible fluxes for each reaction when the system runs near optimality, and has been used to evaluate the consequences of metabolic perturbation (); however, FVA has not been used, to our knowledge, to predict metabolic gene essentiality. A limitation of FBA, MOMA and FVA is the difficulty to define a relevant objective function: for example, the objective function to predict cell growth typically involves a linear combination of more than 100 metabolites (). Other approaches model the effect of gene knock-out using the concept of elementary modes (EMs), which are minimal sets of reactions that can operate at the steady state, such that all irreversible reactions involved are used in the appropriate direction ().shows, for example, the EMs of a simple network. With elementary mode analysis ema proposed that the viability of a mutant carrying mutation in a single gene can be predicted by the number of EMs that do not require the gene, a concept that has been generalized to define a notion of network robustness (). em based methods, however, suffer from computational cost. Although several tools exist to compute EMs of middle size networks *To whom correspondence should be addressed.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press.

However, their computation of the MCSs is based on EMs, which becomes infeasible to analyze large scale metabolic networks. A method based on a dual framework was recently proposed by, which can determine MCSs without calculating the EMs; the formulation is, however, also not scalable for large networks. Finally, different from many other approaches, the concept of synthetic accessibility (SA), proposed by, predicts the viability of mutant strains from the network topology, without knowledge of stoichiometry or biomass growth, but with specification of medium inputs and biomass outputs. An alternative route to model the impact of a perturbation on a metabolic network is to start from a dynamic model of metabolism and assess how the model is impacted when a reaction is inhibited. Boolean models, in particular, are popular to describe and analyze large scale metabolic networks (). Concepts of damage () and topological impact degree () were extensively studied in recent years, where define the impact of a reaction as the number of reactions inactivated by an iterative procedure, mimicking a cascade of failures borrowed the concept of topological impact degree of and extended it to deal with cycles in metabolic networks. However, these methods can not properly handle reversible reactions. In this study, we propose a new model to assess the impact of gene perturbations on a metabolic network, together with efficient algorithms to compute it of large scale networks. The model, which we call flux balance impact degree f bid builds on the concept of steady state fluxes and variability of FBA and FVA. The f bid of a perturbation is defined as the number of reactions that become inactive in all steady states after perturbation. We show that the f bid can be computed either by enumerating all EMs of the metabolic network, or by solving a series of linear programs, the later scaling much better to large networks. In contrast to techniques like FBA, FVA and MOMA, the new f bid does not require the definition of a specific objective function to model growth. Experiments on the Escherichia coli metabolic network show that f bid is competitive with existing approaches. It is computationally efficient even for global metabolic networks, where it outperforms existing approaches in terms of prediction accuracy.

discussion we have proposed f bid a new definition of impact degree, which can not only efficiently deal with the reversible reactions in metabolic networks but also have the state conditions being taken into account. To compute the f bid against perturbations, we proposed two algorithms, an lp based method and an em based algorithm. The advantage of the lp based method is that it can solve all LP instances individually, can strongly benefit on a subjective definition of a relevant objective function. Although computational cost of the lp based method grows with the network size and the number of perturbations to be tested, the overall time complexity is still bounded polynomially. If we are interested in only a few candidate perturbations, then only the corresponding LP need to be solved. The em based method, on the other hand, can compute the f bid of specific perturbations fast for middle scale networks. The main computational advantage of this approach is that the computation of EMs needs to be performed only once, no matter how many perturbation we want to test including perturbations involving several reactions. This advantage vanishes for large scale metabolic networks, however, because of the exponential complexity of computing EMs and the lack of efficient algorithms for that purpose. We carried out computational experiments by using E.coli metabolic networks. The results on computational time for calculating the f bid of different sized networks show that the lp based method implemented with fast fva is efficient, while the em based method did not return any result for large networks owing to the difficulty of computing the EMs. In terms of phenotype prediction, we obtained poor results when we tested metabolic networks with a minimal source input because many metabolic paths are always closed in this case. Comparison of the performance of phenotype prediction with some existing methods indicates that the f bid performs as well as other models or even better, particularly on large networks. The interpretation we give of the f bid in terms of EMs makes an interesting link with existing em based methods that measure how many EMs disappear when we inhibit a reaction (). In our case, we also enumerate the list of EMs that remain once the reaction is inhibited, but instead of focusing on the number of EMs remaining, we focus instead on the number of reactions that can still be activated in the remaining EMs. Although the number of EMs in a network has been used as a measure of flexibility and as an estimate of fault tolerance (), we propose here that the amount of reactions inactivated in cascade may be a better indicator of gene essentiality. Of course, the number of reactions inactivated is itself a crude measure, and investigating variants such as weighting reactions by their 'importance' before counting them may be interesting future work.

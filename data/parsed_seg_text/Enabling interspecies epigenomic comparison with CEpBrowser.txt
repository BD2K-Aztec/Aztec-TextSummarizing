We developed the Comparative epi genome Browser cep browser to allow the public to perform multi-species epi genomic analysis. The web based cep browser integrates, manages and visualizes sequencing based epi genomic datasets. Five key features were developed to maximize the efficiency of interspecies epi genomic comparisons. Availability: cep browser is a web application implemented with PHP, MySQL, C and Apache.

introduction epi genomes play pivotal roles in cell identity, organismal development and disease processes (), contribute to regulating cognition and behavior () and reflect personal variation (). By integrating environmental signals with genomic instructions, epi genomes are instrumental in bridging genotypic variation and phenotypic diversity. Leveraging a number of high throughput sequencing enabled technologies, large international consortia are aiming to generate 41000 epi genomes from normal tissues and associated disease conditions (). Analyzing and interpreting epi genomic information has become a pressing need. The successes obtained in associating epi genomic marks with genomic features inspired initial efforts of systematic annotation of chromatin states (). However, our current capability of interpreting epi genomic information is still primitive. The concept of using cross species comparison to annotate epi genomic functions may revolutionize epi genomic analysis (). Indeed, by exploiting the link between evolutionary selection and regulatory functions, 'comparative epi genomics have annotated epi genomes with unprecedented details (). We have developed the Comparative epi genome Browser cep browser to allow the public to perform multi-species epi genomic analysis. The web based cep browser extends the concepts of the UCSC and Ensembl Genome Browsers () to integrate, manage and visualize large sequencing based datasets for cross species comparisons.

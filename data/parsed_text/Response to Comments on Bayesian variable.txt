X.-Y. Song and Z.-H. LuIn implementation of the MCMC algorithm, Yang and Song (2010a) first integrated  and   out from the joint posterior distribution p(Z,,  ,|Y ,X), and then sampled from the marginal posterior distribution p(Z,|Y ,X) with Gibbs sampler. In the following, we show that the same marginal posterior distribution p(Z,|Y ,X) can be derived when X  X  is singular. To do so, we transform   to  *  as follows:From (7),     is integrated out immediately. According to the same reasonings given in Yang and Song (2010a),  can be integrated out by forming a Gaussian probability density of  in (7), and the remaining exponentiated term in (7) can then be rewritten asThe above expression (8) is similar to (A7) in Yang and Song (2010b) but hereAhere hereA is invertible. The first term in (8) is a completed quadratic form ofof of  , which forms a gaussian probability density and can be integrated out. The second term in (8) forms the kernel of a posterior probability density of Z|X, as Z 1  Z/2,Similar to the derivation in Yang and Song (2010b), we can prove thatIn the following, we further show thatThese propositions can be verified easily by using the definition of the MoorePenrose inverse.We are very thankful to Baragatti and Pommeret for pointing out the technical issue when integrating out   in the case of singularity of X  X . In this response, we have shown that the technical issue can be addressed by slightly modifying the gsgprior in Yang and Song (2010a), and that this minor modification does not change the marginal posterior distribution p(Z,|Y ,X). Therefore, the MCMC algorithm proposed in

Although the 1000 Genomes haplotypes are the most commonly used reference panel for imputation, medical sequencing projects are generating large alternate sets of sequenced samples. Imputation in African Americans using 3384 haplotypes from the Exome Sequencing Project, compared with 2184 haplotypes from 1000 Genomes Project, increased effective sample size by 8.3â€“11.4% for coding variants with minor allele frequency 51%. No loss of imputation quality was observed using a panel built from phenotypic extremes. We recommend using haplotypes from Exome Sequencing Project alone or concatenation of the two panels over quality score-based post-imputation selection or IMPUTE2's two-panel combination.
INTRODUCTIONGenotype imputation is a common practice for both genotyping () and sequencing studies (). Increasingly large reference panels available in the public domain [e.g. those from the 1000 Genomes Project () and UK10K project ()] together with improved statistical methods (Howie *To whom correspondence should be addressed. y The authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the first four and the last two authors should be regarded as joint First Authors. z On behalf of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute GO Exome Sequencing) have enhanced imputation quality, especially for rare variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) 55%. These improvements have resulted in both discovery and refined mapping of association with complex traits (). However, few studies have examined the use of large study-specific reference panels, particularly the use of exome sequencing-derived panels in admixed populations. Here, we present a new resource for imputation in African Americans, built from 1692 African Americans sequenced by the Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) (). We assessed the use of the ESP data as an imputation reference panel and compared the results with those obtained using the 1000 Genomes Project Phase1 (1000G; version 3, March 2012 release) () data. Additionally, we evaluated the potential consequences of using a reference panel built from samples selected on the basis of phenotypic extremes or disease status instead of a population-based random sample. Lastly, we compared multiple approaches to combine the ESP and 1000G panels for the imputation of rare coding variants.
METHODS
Exome Sequencing Project
ESP and African American ParticipantsThe complete ESP dataset () consists of whole exome data for 6823 individuals. Samples were sequenced at the University of Washington (SeattleGO) and the Broad Institute (BroadGO). Among the 6823 individuals, 1692 participants were African Americans with genome-wide association data available for analysis. The 1692 African Americans ESP samples include 845 from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study (The Women's Health Initiative Study) as part of the WHI Sequencing Project (WHISP), and a total of 847 including Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC;) (N  282), Jackson Heart Study (JHS;) (N  366), Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA;) (N  146) and Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA;) (N  53) as part of HeartGO. Most WHISP and HeartGO participants were selected on the basis of primary phenotypes for ESP, which included extremes of body mass index, blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), cholesterol, early onset myocardial infarction (MI) cases and controls, ischemic stroke with either early onset or positive family history. Approximately 15% of samples were selected because of having non-missing data for a selected set of core phenotypes, but were not ascertained based on trait values.
Exome SequencingExome sequencing was performed at the University of Washington (SeattleGO) and the Broad Institute (BroadGO). Initial quality control (QC) on all samples involved sample quantification (PicoGreen), confirmation of high-molecular weight DNA, fingerprint genotyping and sex determination. Samples were failed if total mass, concentration, integrity of DNA or quality of preliminary genotyping data was too low or sex typing was discordant. Following QC, 2 mg of extracted genomic DNA was subjected to shotgun library preparation and exome capture as previously described ().
Genotype CallingFor read mapping and variant analysis, samples were aligned to a human reference (hg19) using BurrowsWheeler Aligner (). Variant detection and genotyping were performed on both exomes and flanking 50 bp of intronic sequence. Typical mean coverage of the target was 6080. Variant data for each sample were formatted (variant call format) as 'raw' calls for all samples. Filters considered the total read depth, the number of individuals with coverage at the site, the fraction of variant reads in each heterozygote, the ratio of forward and reverse strand reads carrying reference and variant alleles and the average position of variant alleles along a read. Variant calling was performed across all 6515 samples at the University of Michigan (UMich). Only single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that passed the UMich support vector machine quality filter were retained for analysis. Details were previously described ().).
Reference Panel Construction
ESP 'Extreme' and 'Normal' Panel Construction The 1692ESP African Americans were selected based on the following phenotypic traits: (i) LDL (N  254: 131 with high LDL and 123 with low LDL), (ii) blood pressure (N  247: 132 with high blood pressure and 115 with low blood pressure), (iii) body mass index (BMI, N  609: 429 with high BMI and 180 with normal to low BMI), (iv) early onset MI (EOMI, N  324: 39 EOMI cases and 285 EOMI controls), (v) stroke (N  40, all cases) and (vi) random samples (N  218). We constructed one ESP 'Extreme' panel and one ESP 'Normal' panel each with 853 individuals. The ESP 'Extreme' panel included (i) 254 individuals with high/low LDL (131 with high LDL and 123 with low LDL), (ii) 247 individuals with high/low blood pressure (132 with high blood pressure and 115 with low blood pressure), (iii) 40 stroke cases, (iv) 39 EOMI cases and (v) 273 individuals with high BMI. The ESP 'Normal' panel consists of 80% individuals with 'non-extreme' phenotypes and 20% with extreme phenotypes so as to better represent a population sample. Individuals with 'nonextreme' phenotypes (N  683) are from random sample, EOMI controls and low BMI group. Individuals with extreme phenotypes (N  170) are from high (N  85) and low LDL (N  85) group.

Target African Americans
GWAS Data All of the 1661 target African Americans in thisstudy were genotyped using the Affymetrix 6.0 genotyping platform as part of the WHI SNP Health Association Resource study. Before phasing and imputation, we removed Affymetrix 6.0 SNPs with genotype call rates 590%, or HardyWeinberg exact test () P510 6 or MAF 51%. QC details were described previously ().
Metabochip data All of the 1661 target African Americans inthis study were also genotyped using the Metabochip () in an attempt to generalize genetic effects across racial groups by the WHI Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study. Standard QC was performed, including removal of markers with genotype call rate 595% or HardyWeinberg P 510 6 , as well as exclusion of individuals who showed excess heterozygosity, were part of an apparent first-degree relative pair, or were ancestry outliers as determined by Eigensoft (). Details can be found in the PAGE Metabochip article (). Genotypes at the Metabochip SNPs were not used for imputation but rather used for assessment of imputation quality. In total 5035 markers, which were on Metabochip, in 1000G and in ESP, but not on Affymetrix 6.0, were used for imputation quality assessment.
Overlap with ESP African Americans African Americanspresent in ESP were not included as target. In other words, individuals in the reference ESP and the target were mutually exclusive. In addition, we removed any target with PLINK () estimated identity-by-descent (IBD) !0.2 with any reference individual such that our final target set did not contain any apparent first-degree relative with the reference ESP.
Imputation using IMPUTE2In the main text, unless otherwise specified, we present results using minimac for imputation. Supplementaryand Supplementaryshowed that our recommendation of ESP alone or concatenation of ESP with 1000G (ESP_U_1000G) over 1000G still held when IMPUTE2 was used for imputation. We note that in the main text, our recommendation against IMPUTE2's two panel mode (option 3: ESP  1000G) was confounded by software/method choice: ESP alone or ESP_U_1000G using minimac performed better than IMPUTE2's ESP  1000G, but when using IMPUTE2 for all, ESP alone or ESP_U_1000G performed similarly as ESP  1000G.
RESULTS
Comparison of imputation quality between ESP-based and 1000G-based imputationWe first performed imputation, using either ESP or 1000G as reference, into 1661 African Americans in the WHI study (the 'target' sample) who were genotyped by both the Affymetrix 6.0 () and the Illumina Metabochip array (). We used MaCH (), a hidden Markov model that leverages linkage disequilibrium information among samples of unrelated individuals, to pre-phase the 1661 WHI African Americans at the Affymetrix 6.0 markers. The ESP reference panel was built from 1692 African Americans with genotypes from both the Affymetrix 6.0 platform and whole exome sequencing. These genotypes were merged and phased using BEAGLE (). Imputation into the 1661 target WHI African Americans was performed with minimac () (similar results were obtained with IMPUTE2; see Methods) using their Affymetrix 6.0 genotypes only; genotypes from the Metabochip genotyping were saved for evaluation. Following the literature (), we used dosage r 2 [squared Pearson correlation between imputed dosages (ranging continuously from 0 to 2) and experimental genotypes (coded as 0, 1 or 2)], which directly determines effective sample size for subsequent association analysis (), to gauge imputation quality. We also use Rsq, the estimated dosage r 2 generated by minimac, as the post-imputation QC metric.). As imputation is routinely performed in 10 000100 000 individuals (), such an increase would correspond to increasing the sample size for association testing by 100010 000 samples. Because the ESP panel is larger and consists entirely of African Americans, we conducted more comparisons by assessing the performance of 10 random subsets from ESP of the same size as 1000G (both for the full 1000G panel). The difference in effective sample size derived from the ESP and 1000G reference panels, although smaller, remains (and Supplementary). For example, when comparing ESP.1092 with 1000G.1092 and retaining all imputed variants in the analysis (no post-imputation QC), we observed an average dosage r 2 increase of 11.3, 4.6 and 6.1% for variants with MAF 50.2%, 0.20.5% and 0.51%, respectively. The corresponding dosage r 2 increases for a comparison of ESP.625 with 1000G.625 were 13.9%, 1.0 and 3.1%, respectively. The superior performance of ESP over 1000G was likely driven by two primary factors. First, genotypes for rare variants from ESP were derived from high coverage sequencing, whereas those from 1000G were in part from low coverage sequencing (1000G data we used here are the integrated panel constructed from low coverage whole genome sequencing, deep exome sequencing and SNP array genotyping). Second, ESP African Americans ($50% also from WHI, detailed in Materials and Methods) were better matched to the 'target' WHI African Americans for ancestry than were the samples in the 1000G panel, which were pooled from several populations of European, African and African American ancestry.As expected, better quality imputation using the ESP panel produces a larger number of well-imputed rare coding variants than using the 1000G panel (Rsq40.6 for MAF50.5%; detailed in). For example, the number of well-imputed variants was 2.28, 2.83, and 1.54 times greater than that from 1000G for MAF 50.2, 0.20.5 and 0.51%, respectively (). The boost in imputation quality as well as in the number of wellimputed markers is expected to enhance power for testing association with phenotypic traits. For example, out of the eight novel blood trait associated variants reported in), two are not in 1000G but ESP only (Supplementary).
Impact of imputation reference panel constructed from subjects selected based on extreme phenotypesMany subjects sequenced in ESP were selected on the basis of phenotypic extremes or disease status (detailed in Materials and Methods), an approach that has been shown to increase power for association testing of the specific phenotype (). To our knowledge, the consequences of such a design for developing an imputation reference panel have not been previously evaluated. To this end, we constructed two ESP-derived reference panels: 'ESP.extreme' and 'ESP.normal' each of size H  853  2. The former included 254 African Americans from LDL cholesterol extremes, 247 from blood pressure extremes, 40 stroke cases, 39 early onset MI (EOMI) cases and 273 with extremely high BMI. The latter included 85 samples with high LDL, 85 with low LDL and 683 from the 'middle' of the phenotype distributions. We observed no loss of imputation quality using the 'Extreme' panel. (and Supplementary).
Alternative options to use or combine ESP and 1000G reference panelsAlthough our results suggested that the ESP panel led to substantially improved imputation accuracy of rare coding variants compared with the 1000G panel, the combination of the two panels could potentially result in even better performance than either one individually. We considered the following four options. The default option, Option 0, was to select a single panel a priori based on reference panel size, marker density and ancestry match. In this case, Option 0 would be the ESP reference panel alone, as it contains more haplotypes (3384 over 2184 in 1000G), greater marker density in exons and a better ancestry match with the target African Americans. Option 1 was to first impute using each panel separately, and then for each marker to select the one with higher Rsq. Option 2 was to impute using a concatenated panel of the two (ESP_U_1000G). Option 3 was to impute using IMPUTE2, which allows two separate reference panels (ESP  1000G). The best option among the four was the concatenation of the two panels (Option 2) with ESP alone (Option 0), a close second best. For example, the average dosage r 2 increased by 1.8%, 2.3% and 1.5%, respectively, for markers with MAF 50.2, 0.20.5 and 0.51% using Option 2 over Option 0 (Supplementaryand Supplementary). We observed no noticeable gains using Option 1 compared withOption 0 with differences in dosage r 2 in the range of 0.021.5% (Supplementaryand Supplementary). Therefore, we would not recommend using Option 1, the Rsq-based selection, because higher Rsq does not guarantee better imputation quality. In fact a low quality reference panel could lead to poorly estimated Rsq values. Finally, IMPUTE2's ability to combine two reference panels (Option 3), led to decreased imputation quality compared with Option 0. For example, dosage r 2 decreased by an average of 7.3, 4.3 and 3.9% for markers with MAF 0.2, 0.20.5 and 0.51% (and Supplementaryand Supplementary). Although less accurate, the convenience provided by IMPUTE2's approach warrants closer consideration. Decreases in quality could be due to software implementation because we used minimac for options 02 and IMPUTE2 for option 3. But importantly, our recommendation of concatenation of the two or ESP alone over 1000G alone or post-imputation Rsq-based selection holds when IMPUTE2 was used for all four options (see 'Imputation using IMPUTE2' in Materials and Methods, Supplementaryand Supplementary).
DISCUSSIONWe note that ESP is heavily enriched for extremes from several phenotypes rather than a single phenotype. Thus, it is unclear whether these results generalize to a design where sequenced subjects are selected based on extremes for a single phenotype. We did not attempt to select one phenotype for evaluation, as doing so would reduce our reference size to below 300, which we view as of little value for the imputation of rare variants. We expect such 'Extreme' panels to make little difference for imputation overall and may affect imputation in the specific trait associated regions when the causal variant(s) exert large effect(s). Although we recommend the concatenation of ESP and 1000G, we observed only modest gains in imputation quality by combining the two. Previous studies suggest that these gains may depend in part on the ethnic make-up of the study subjects () and whether 1000G data add substantial haplotype diversity. These gains should be weighed against the logistical challenges of combining data from multiple sources to avoid batch effects (e.g. mismatched strands, inconsistent marker naming schemes or systematic differences in genotype calling, QC or phasing). In summary, we found that the ESP African American reference panel outperformed the 1000G reference panel for the imputation of rare coding variants in African Americans, both in terms of imputation quality, the number of imputable markers and consequently power for trait association testing. The finding was robust to adjustment of reference size and matching on ethnicity. We did not observe loss of imputation quality because of the ESP design for enriched sequencing of subjects selected for phenotypic extremes. Regarding the optimal way to combine the two panels, our evaluations suggested that ESP alone or concatenation of the ESP and 1000G reference panels was superior to either post-imputation selection based on Rsq or IMPUTE2's implementation of two separate reference panels. We focused here on imputation of coding variants from ESP. However, we believe that the conclusions drawn here apply to rare variants across the genome as recently reported by several whole-genome sequencing-based studies () in individuals of European ancestry. These studies and our present work strongly suggest that population matched samples, even in diverse populations such as African Americans, can clearly outperform 1000G imputation performance. Therefore, we recommend investigators routinely consider sequencing for the design () and analysis of the study samples.

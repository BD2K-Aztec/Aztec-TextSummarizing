Motivation: The analysis of differentially expressed gene sets became a routine in the analyses of gene expression data. There is a multitude of tests available, ranging from aggregation tests that summarize gene-level statistics for a gene set to true multivariate tests, accounting for intergene correlations. Most of them detect complex departures from the null hypothesis but when the null hypothesis is rejected, the specific alternative leading to the rejection is not easily identifiable. Results: In this article we compare the power and Type I error rates of minimum-spanning tree (MST)-based non-parametric multivariate tests with several multivariate and aggregation tests, which are frequently used for pathway analyses. In our simulation study, we demonstrate that MST-based tests have power that is for many settings comparable with the power of conventional approaches, but outper-form them in specific regions of the parameter space corresponding to biologically relevant configurations. Further, we find for simulated and for gene expression data that MST-based tests discriminate well against shift and scale alternatives. As a general result, we suggest a two-step practical analysis strategy that may increase the interpret-ability of experimental data: first, apply the most powerful multivariate test to find the subset of pathways for which the null hypothesis is rejected and second, apply MST-based tests to these pathways to select those that support specific alternative hypotheses.
INTRODUCTIONIn the era of high-throughput biology, technical difficulties of obtaining large-scale datasets are gradually becoming less pronounced, as compared with difficulties in the data analyses and interpretation. In the analysis of gene expression data, a conceptual shift toward a better interpretability of results happened almost a decade ago, when, instead of testing for the differential expression of a single gene, the first test for testing the differential expression of a set of genes, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) () was suggested. The motivating ideas of GSEA are 3-fold. First, small changes in gene expression, a sign mark of metabolic diseases, cannot be captured by a single gene using conventional tests such as a t-statistic together with a correction for multiple testing (). Second, the data interpretation can be greatly facilitated: conventionally gene sets represent molecular pathways and the differential expression of a pathway has more explanatory power compared with a single differentially expressed gene. Third, genes do not work in isolation but interact with each other; as a consequence, accounting for the multivariate nature of expression changes is more biologically relevant (Emmert). Since the advent of GSEA, many methodologies for testing the differential expression of gene sets (molecular pathways, biological processes) have been suggested and collectively named Gene Set Analysis (GSA) approaches (). GSA approaches have been classified into two categories: competitive and self-contained (). Competitive approaches compare a gene set against a background dataset, and self-contained tests compare whether a gene set is differentially expressed between two phenotypes. That means, self-contained tests are conceptually similar to classical two-sample statistical inference methods, e.g. individual gene tests based on a t-test, only with the unit of change being a set of genes rather than a single gene. Unfortunately, both categories have their own pitfalls and benefits. For instance, competitive approaches are dependent on the size of the entire dataset (), whereas in the case of self-contained approaches, a potential weakness is that null hypotheses tested by self-contained tests are not equivalent (Emmert). Previously, we demonstrated that the space of null hypotheses for self-contained GSA is mostly covered by three null hypotheses: their exact formulation reflects the underlying test statistic (). Specifically, consider the multivariate distribution of gene expressions in a gene set for a given phenotype. For the multivariate Hotelling T 2-statistic null hypothesis is formulated as the equality of the mean expression vectors of the two multivariate gene expression distributions () and the null hypothesis of multivariate N-statistic is the equality of the two multivariate gene expression distributions (). In contrast, gene-level test statistics aggregating scores, *To whom correspondence should be addressed. E-mail: yrahmatallah@uams.edu describing changes in the expression of individual genes (e.g. the squared values of individual t-tests), state the null hypothesis as the equality of aggregated scores between phenotypes (). The aforementioned three null hypotheses are not equivalent and each test projects on different aspects of the data. It should be emphasized, that gene-level test statistics disregard existing, complex correlation structures within a gene set. In real biological settings, moderate (), as well as extensive () correlations between genes in gene sets are well documented () and can result in a decrease in power for gene-level tests, compared with multivariate tests (). In this article, we further explore the opportunities to increase the biological interpretability of experimental results under the self-contained GSA framework. We start with the introduction of multivariate generalizations of the WaldWolfowitz (WW) and KolmogorovSmirnov (KS) non-parametric two-sample tests, which were developed more than three decades ago () based on the minimum spanning tree (MST) structure. These tests, however, have never been considered and implemented in the context of gene set analysis prior to our work. Using simulated data, as well as expression arrays we compare the properties of multivariate WW and KS tests with conventional multivariate tests, such as the N-statistic () and rotation gene set test (ROAST) (), as well as gene-level tests, such as SAM-GS () and the median of P-values from t-tests for individual genes. One property of multivariate non-parametric two-sample tests, namely that they can discriminate against several alternative hypotheses (), is specifically important in the context of data interpretability. For instance, a typical analysis question that asks, 'Is the expression of a pathway different between two phenotypes', can be too unspecific from a biological perspective. For this reason, employing statistical hypotheses tests that allow formulating more specific alternatives can sharpen the initial question itself, elucidating why the null hypothesis H 0 was rejected. The R-code for the multivariate generalizations of the WW and KS non-parametric two-sample tests is available in the Supplementary Material.
METHODSConsider two biological conditions with different outcomes, with n 1 samples of measurements of p genes for the first, and n 2 samples of measurement of the same p genes for the second conditions. Let the two p-dimensional random vectors of measurements X  (X 1 ,. .. , X n1) and Y  (Y 1 ,. .. , Y n2 ) be independent and identically distributed with the distribution functions F, G, mean vectors " X, " Y and p  p covariance matrices Sx, Sy. We consider the problem of testing the hypothesis H 0 : F  G against an alternative F 6  G. In what follows, we briefly describe two multivariate generalizations of the WW and KS tests (seefor more details) and discuss other conventional self-contained GSA approaches we use. The simulation setup to explore the properties of GSA approaches closely follows our previous strategy () and is briefly outlined in the end of this section.
Test statistics
Multivariate generalizationof the WW and KS tests When p  1 the WW and KS tests both begin by sorting the N  n 1  n 2 observations in ascending order. Then, in the WW test the observation is replaced by its sample labels (X or Y) and the number of 'runs' (R) is calculated, where R is a consecutive sequence of identical labels. The test statistic is a function of the number of runs and is approximately normally distributed. H 0 is rejected if the number of runs is small. In the KS test, observations are ranked and the quantity d i  r i =n 1  s i =n 2 is calculated; r i (s i ) are number of observations in X (Y) ranked lower than i, 1 i N. The test statistic is the maximal absolute difference as follows:D  max jd i j  1 H 0 is rejected for large differences. The multivariate generalization for both tests (p41), suggested in () is based on the MST. The MST of an edge-weighted graph is a spanning tree with the minimal sum of weighted edges. For pooled multivariate observations X, Y an edge-weighted graph can be constructed, with N nodes and N(N  1)/2 edge weights estimated by the Euclidean (or any other) distances between pairs of points in R p. The MST of a graph connects points that are 'close' in R p. In this way, it associates similar nodes (samples) in terms of their distances. Similar to the univariate case, in the multivariate generalization of the WW test, all edges in a MST incident between nodes belonging to different sample labels are removed, and the number of the remaining disjoint subtrees (R) is calculated (). The permutation distribution of the standardized number of subtrees W  R  E R ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi VarR p 2 is asymptotically normal and H 0 is rejected for a small number of subtrees (). The multivariate generalization of KS ranks multivariate observations based on their MST. The purpose of MST ranking (see below) is to obtain the strong relation between observations differences in ranks and their distances in R p. The ranking algorithm can be designed specifically to confine a particular alternative hypothesis more power. The general scheme is to root MST tree at a node with the largest geodesic distance and then rank the nodes in the 'high directed preorder' traversal of the tree. As in the univariate case, the test statistic D (with tabulated distribution) is found for the ranked nodes. If one is interested in a test with high power (HP) toward changes in the variance structure of the distribution, the ranking is implemented differently, aiming to give higher ranks to more distant points in R p. That is, MST tree is rooted at the node with the smallest geodesic distance and nodes with the largest depths are assigned higher ranks (). This 'radial' KolmogorovSmirnov (RKS) test is sensitive to alternatives having similar mean vectors but differences in scale. We want to mention that the underlying conceptual idea of the WW and KS tests based on MSTs is similar to (), however, with reversed roles for the usage of samples and genes. Here, we consider only LX, Y  jjX  Y jj, the Euclidian distance in R p. In the original papers, several other kernel functions, L were suggested as well (). Nstatistic is actually a metric on the space of all probability measures on R p (). Rotation gene set tests (ROAST) () uses the framework of linear models and tests whether for all genes in a set a particular contrast of the coefficients is non-zero (). It can account for correlations between genes and has the flexibility of using different alternative hypotheses, testing whether the direction of changes for a gene in a set is 'up', 'down' or 'mixed' (up or down) (). For all comparisons implemented here, the 'mixed' hypothesis was selected.). For instance, as a summary gene set statistic, the median and mean of gene-level P-values from t-tests were employed. We observed that the mean of P-values had less power compared with the median (data not shown). In the following, only results for the median of P-values (mpv-test) are presented. Shrinking the standard error of a test statistic (e.g. a t-test) in testing differential expression of individual genes improves the power of the test. Several shrinkage approaches at the level of individual genes were suggested, including the Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM) test (), the regularized t-test () and the moderated t-test (). An extension of SAM test to gene set analysis (SAM-GS) was also suggested () and has been demonstrated to outperform several conventional self-contained tests, including competetive GSEA approach (). Therefore, we included SAM-GS in our comparative power analysis.
Univariate test
Significance testing To estimatethe null distribution of a test statistic numerically to obtain P-values, for all test statistics, except ROAST, 1000 sample permutations were used. ROAST uses a random rotation of the data matrix, which has been shown to give meaningful results, even for small sample sizes ().
Simulation setupIn real biological settings not all genes in a gene set are differentially expressed, and intergene correlations vary in strength (). We therefore designed simulations specifically to be able to control: (i) the percentage of genes, truly differentially expressed between two phenotypes, parameter and (ii) the strength of the correlations between genes, parameter r. These parameters seriously influence the power of the test and it is important to understand the magnitude of influence for different tests statistics. We simulated two samples of equal size, N/2 (N  40, N  20, N  10) from the p-dimensional normal distribution N0, AE and N, AE representing two biological conditions with different outcomes. We considered two scenarios: when the number of genes in a gene set (pathway), p is relatively small (p  20) and relatively large (p  100). The parameter, indicating the proportion of genes in a pathway under alternative hypothesis, was set to 2{0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1}. To control the strength of intergene correlations for a gene set, three correlation regimes: low, medium and high (0.1, 0.5, 0.9) were simulated. Two alternative hypotheses were formulated: H a1. The mean vector for the first biological condition was fixed as 0 and all components i of the mean vector, for the second biological condition were set to change from 0 to 2 with a step size of 0.2, that is was varied from  0, :::, 0 to  2, :::, 2. The diagonal elements of the covariance matrix s 2 ii , i.e. variances of individual genes, were set to 1. H a2. The mean vectors for both conditions were fixed at  0, :::, 0 but the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix s 2 ii , i.e. variances of individual genes, were fixed in one condition and set to change from 1 to 5 with a step size of 0.5 in the other. For alternatives H a1 and H a2 , different settings result in 24 and 6 simulated datasets, respectively. For each value of the mean or the variance, we averaged over 1000 independent runs (gene sets).presents estimates for the attained significance levels of the seven tests. As can be seen, ROAST and SAM-GS provide more conservative estimates of the Type I error rate for small and medium intergene correlations than the N-statistic. In turn, the N-statistic controls the Type I error rate slightly better than non-parametric generalizations of the WW and KS tests, while the median P-values test shows the best control ().presents the results of power estimates, when H a1 is true, for seven tests with p  20 genes in a pathway. The parameter (the percentage of genes, truly differentially expressed between two phenotypes, 2{0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1}) is increasing from the top to the bottom for all three columns. The parameter r2{0.1, 0.5, 0.9} (intergene correlations) is increasing from the left to the right for all four rows. First, consider the case, when all genes in a pathway are differentially expressed (  1) and the intergene correlations are low (r  0.1). In this case, the seven tests form three different groups (). N-statistic, ROAST and SAM-GS have an identical power and form one group with a high power (HP) capable of detecting small changes; the median of P-values test (median of Pvalue test (mpv-test)), multivariate KS and WW tests form another group with a lower power (LP); the RKS test has almost no power (NP) to detect even large differences. This is actually what one would expect: the power of non-parametric tests is slightly lower than the power of parametric tests, the power of gene-level test without shrinking the standard error is lower than the power of the shrinkage (SAM-GS) and multivariate tests. The test sensitive for the scale alternative, expectedly, has almost no power to detect the shift alternative. This categorization remains unchanged (same tests belong to HP, LP, NP groups) even when we alter the number of differentially expressed genes, given the intergene correlations are still low (r  0.1, first column of). Only the power of the mpv-test decreases to zero for  0.25. Also, it should be noted that WW is becoming more powerful than KS when the parameter is decreasing. Unexpected changes in the power curves are seen for higher correlations and 2{0.25, 0.5, 0.75} (middle column, bottom up). Given r  0.5, the content of the HP, LP, NP groups has been changed. Now the WW test joins the HP group, and only the KS test remains in the LP group. The power of the mpv-test decreases fast with. Further, the power of RKS remains low. More dramatic changes in the power curves are seen when the intergene correlations become the highest (r  0.9) and 2 {0.25, 0.5, 0.75} (right-most column,). For these settings, the WW test outperforms all the others and populates along the HP group, whereas ROAST, SAM-GS, N-statistic and KS test form the LP group. As before, the power of the mpv-test decreases fast with. Again, the power of the N-statistic and the KS test is comparable and is becoming higher than the power of ROAST and SAM-GS when decreases. The results for p  100 (Supplementary) are similar to those for p  20, but all the trends discussed above are more pronounced. In general, when p  100, the power of all tests under different settings is higher and less dependent on. The power of the WW test is already higher than all the others when r  0.5 and 2{0.25, 0.5, 0.75}. The power of the KS test is higher than the power of ROAST, SAM-GS and N-statistic when r  0.9 and 2{0.25, 0.5, 0.75} (Supplementary, right-most column). The mpv-test has some power even when  0.5. To summarize, from the simulation results we can see that the power of all tests, except WW, decreases with the increase of intergene correlations. Unexpectedly, the power of WW test is higher than that of all the other tests when the intergene correlations are high: r2{0.5, 0.9}, 2{0.25, 0.5, 0.75}. Notably, the power of the KS test is comparable with the N-statistic, ROAST and SAM-GS when simultaneously, decreases and the intergene correlations increase. RKS has almost no power in all conditions. The power of the mpv-test is similar (but lower) to ROAST, SAM-GS, KS and N-statistic when 2{1, 0.75}, but is very small when  0.5 and decreases to zero when  0.25. All these results are expected, except the result for the WW test. The question is: Why does WW outperform all other tests when 2{0.25, 0.5, 0.75} and the correlations are high? To investigate the behavior of the WW test in these settings, we consider an example when p  2 and there are two different phenotypes, X and Y from two bivariate normal distributions (). Consider the case when the intergene correlation is low () and either one (  0.5), or two genes (  1) in a pathway are differentially expressed (phenotypes Y  05 and Y  1 ). Samples from two phenotypes (either X, Y  05 or X, Y  1 ) are independent, scattered within two contours and the intersection areas between phenotypes X and Y  0.5 and X and Y  1 are of similar size. The number of disjoint subtrees obtained from the MST tree (R-statistic) is proportional to the number of samples from X and Y in a close proximity of each other. That means, when the correlation is low, the power of the WW test is similar for both cases,  0.5 and  1. When correlation is high (), the samples are no longer independent and scattered in the same direction. If  0.5, one gene is changing, and the distribution is shifted along one axis (45 with minor elliptical axis). If  1, both genes are changing, and the distribution is shifted in the direction of the major elliptical axis. The difference in the shift directions results in a larger intersection area between X and Y  1 when compared with X and Y  05 , and as a consequence, a smaller power of the WW test for a high gamma and high correlations. This explanation can be generalized to cases with p42 and explains the high power exhibited by the WW test in(intergene correlations) is increasing from left to right. As expected, WW, ROAST, SAM-GS and KS have no power to detect changes in the scale, because they were not designed for this scenario. RKS has a high power to detect even small changes in the variance structure and outperforms the N-statistic for all values of the intergene correlations. The power of the N-statistic decreases significantly when the correlation increases to r  0.9. Interestingly, in these settings, the WW test acquires some power that increases for large differences in scale (). The results for p  100 (Supplementary) are similar to those for p  20. For a sample size N  20 the power of all tests was significantly smaller, however, the pattern of differences between the different tests remains the same (Supplementary Figs S3 and S4). However, with the smaller sample size (N  10) all tests perform equally poor and comparative power analysis does not make sense anymore (Supplementary Figs S5 and S6). Because the result for ROAST and SAM-GS were almost identical in all settings, we did not include SAM-GS in the analysis of real data.

3.2The analysis of solid tumors (kidney, lung and pancreas) expression arrayspresents the overview of the datasets analyzed, selected from the comparative study of meta-analysis and integrated approaches in (). Data were normalized using the Robust Multi-array Average method and among multiple probes measuring the same target mRNA probes with maximum inter-quartile ranges (IQR) were selected. Half of the probes that exhibit the lowest variability (IQR) were filtered out, as recommended (e.g. by). At the end of these filtering steps, the final number of probes considered out of the total number for GSE7670, GSE15471 and GSE15641 were 6359 out of 22 283, 9899 out of 54 675 and 6359 out of 22 283. All three datasets () have 'normal' and 'cancer' samples. To find pathways, differentially expressed between these two phenotypes, six aforementioned tests were applied, and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome (KEGG) database () was used as a source to define molecular pathways. Overall, three datasets had 201 KEGG pathways in common (). After controlling the false-discovery rate (FDR) at a level of 0.05 with the Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) procedure three tests, namely ROAST, N-statistic and WW (except for GSE7670) found all these pathways to be differentially expressed (). Although KS and the median P-values tests did not find all the pathways to be differentially expressed, the amount found was comparable (138198 pathways). Finally, the RKS test has found 126, 169 and 131 pathways to be differentially expressed for the lung, pancreas and kidney cancer datasets, respectively. The result is similar to what one could expect from the simulation study. In most settings for the simulated data the N-statistic, ROAST and WW have had a better power than the KS, RKS and median P-values tests. The rejection of the null hypothesis H 0 per se is important and informative. However, there are potentially many reasons for a rejection. Consider the most powerful test for the analysis of differentially expressed pathways, N-statistic which is designed to detect complex departures from the null hypothesis H 0 , such as differences in marginal distributions, shift and scale alternatives and changes in the correlation structures. Therefore, if the null hypothesis is rejected by the N-statistic, we are not armed to dissect the specific alternative leading to rejection. Similarly, if ROAST or WW reject the null hypothesis, the true alternative hypothesis cannot be uniquely identified. The benefit of applying the new KS and RKS tests is that, while lacking the flexibility to test complex departures from H 0 , they are designed to detect the simple alternatives: changes in the shift and scale. The knowledge about these specific alternatives can be important in interpreting the results. For this reason, we suggest using these two tests as complementary tools to clarify the cause for the rejection of the null hypothesis H 0 (see below). From our analysis, we found 17, 7 and 5 pathways for GSE7670 (lung), GSE15471 (pancreas) and GSE15641 (kidney), respectively, only detected by RKS and not detected by KS, and there were 65, 29 and 67 pathways only detected by KS but not RKS (). RKS has the highest power to detect scale, whereas KS has the highest power to detect shift alternatives and in the pathways, detected exclusively by either one of them, exactly these two moments are changing.presents boxplots for the means and variances of genes, included in the pathways, detected by RKS only. As one can see, even the univariate differences in the mean variances between normal and cancer samples are very pronounced (c, right panels), more pronounced than differences in the univariate mean changes (c, left panels). Interestingly, for pathways detected by multivariate RKS and by both, RKS and KS tests, there is a good agreement between the multivariate tests and the univariate KS test of difference in the distributions of mean expression variances (Supplementary). However, there is no agreement between the univariate KS testof difference in the distributions of mean expressions and its multivariate counterpart (Supplementary). These observations underscore the high power of RKS to detect scale differences.presents boxplots and MST trees for three selected pathways (GSE15641, kidney cancer) detected by RKS only (), KS only () and KS and RKS () tests. It is visually compelling that in all three cases the 'amount' of differences between the mean variances and the mean expressions between two phenotypes is in agreement with the test-specific alternatives. MST trees for the selected pathways () show major differences. For the mRNA surveillance pathway (), samples of one phenotype constitute the backbone of the MST, while samples of the other phenotype form the branches. Since the center node is naturally at the center of the backbone, there are significant differences in ranks assigned to two phenotypes. In contrast, for pathways detected by KS () and KS and RKS () on the corresponding MST trees samples of each phenotype are grouped together. Another important result is that pathways, detected exclusively by RKS (Supplementary) were tumor-specific, that means among them only one ('Neurothrophin signaling pathway', 04722) was simultaneously detected in two datasets (GSE7670, lung and GSE15641, kidney cancer data). Pathways, detected by the KS test only, were less specific: there were 8 and 21 common pathways, between GSE7670 (lung) and GSE15471 (pancreas), GSE15641 (kidney), respectively, and 9 common pathways between GSE15471 and GSE15641 (Supplementary). For all three datasets there was one pathway, 'Circadian rhythmmammal' detected by KS as having differences in mean vectors between normal and cancer samples. Because the N-statistic detected all 201 pathways as being differentially expressed, not surprisingly, there were 53 pathways, detected simultaneously by RKS and KS in all three datasets (Supplementary). It may indicate that the rest of the pathways (that is pathways detected exclusively by the Nstatistic, as well as ROAST and WW tests, and not by RKS and KS, or RKS only, or KS only) have a more complex departure from the null hypothesis H 0 , than the scale and shift alternatives. The analysis of the real data demonstrates that the N-statistic, ROAST and WW are robust and consistently detect any kind of departure from an alternative on a set of solid tumors. In turn, pathways, discovered exclusively by RKS or KS (to a smaller extent) highlight changes pertinent to a specific tumor.) but all of them have a potential weakness: the analysis result is difficult to interpret. For example, N-statistic, the most powerful multivariate test, has a complex alternative hypothesis: difference of two multivariate distributions (). Similarly, tests employing aggregated score of gene-level test statistics do not have a well-specified alternative (). Here, we demonstrate that the application of multivariate generalizations of the WW and KS (including RKS) nonparametric two-sample tests, that were developed by, makes GSA approaches more comprehensive and helps to interpret the results better. Our simulation study suggests that WW, KS and RKS all have specific characteristics important in the analysis of real biological data. Contrary to the conventional GSA multivariate tests (such as N-statistic and ROAST), the power of the WW test increases with the increase of the intergene correlations. This is an unexpected property suitable for the analysis of highly correlated expression data. In turn, the KS and RKS tests also have important differences from conventional tests: KS is exclusively sensitive to shift and RKS is mostly sensitive to scale alternatives, respectively. The analysis of real expression data confirms the major trends in the tests' power, observed in simulations.Indeed, for all three expression datasets considered the WW test is as powerful as conventional approaches. In turn, RKS and KS tests can detect different alternatives. From our analysis, we suggest the following approach for a GSA: first, use the most powerful multivariate test (e.g. N-statistic or WW test) for detecting all pathways for which the null hypothesis H 0 is rejected. Then, for a subset of these pathways the cause for their detection can be found by testing for a shift and scale alternatives, using KS or RKS. The pathways, selected under different alternatives potentially will help in interpreting the reasons of underlying phenotypic changes. The intersection of genes in these pathways can constitute a phenotype-specific gene signature, different for different alternatives and important in the follow-up studies. There are many opportunities to improve the tests' sensitivity and scope, provided by MST structure employed in nonparametric multivariate generalization of two-sample tests. For instance, a MST tree can be constructed using any dissimilarity measure and for any types of data (on an ordinal or ratio scale). That means the multivariate generalization of KS and WW are readily applicable for the analysis of RNA-Seq data, represented by read counts. Further, for such data a different dissimilarity measure than that used in our study (Euclidean distance) may lead to differences in the observed power. Another interesting opportunity provided by a MST structure is in defining a pertinent procedure for a subtrees ranking that can be sensitive to various alternatives. We conclude that the use of the multivariate non-parametric generalization of two-sample tests and the exploration of their potential improvement can increase our ability to interpret the results of large-scale expression experiments and dissect relevant biological processes leading to phenotypic changes between two conditions.

Spatial patterns of gene expression are of key importance in understanding developmental networks. Using in situ hybridization, many laboratories are generating images to describe these spatial patterns and to test biological hypotheses. To facilitate such analyses, we have developed biologist-centric software (myFX) that contains computational methods to automatically process and analyze images depicting embryonic gene expression in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. It facilitates creating digital descriptions of spatial patterns in images and enables measurements of pattern similarity and visualization of expression across genes and developmental stages. myFX interacts directly with the online FlyExpress database, which allows users to search thousands of existing patterns to find co-expressed genes by image comparison. Availability and implementation: myFX is freely available at http:// www.flyexpress.net.

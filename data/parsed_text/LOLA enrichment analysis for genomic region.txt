Genomic datasets are often interpreted in the context of large-scale reference databases. One approach is to identify significantly overlapping gene sets, which works well for gene-centric data. However, many types of high-throughput data are based on genomic regions. Locus Overlap Analysis (LOLA) provides easy and automatable enrichment analysis for genomic region sets, thus facilitating the interpretation of functional genomics and epigenomics data.

Key features of LOLA are its integration with R and Bioconductor; a command-line interface supporting automated data processing; compatibility with high-throughput pipelines as well as interactive scripting in R; fast runtime even for very large region lists and reference databases; a comprehensive core database of regulatory elements; and convenient support for users to create custom reference databases. Each LOLA analysis is based on three components ():(i)The query setone or more lists of genomic regions to be tested for enrichment; (ii) a region universethe background set of regions that could potentially have been included in the query set; and (iii) a reference database of genomic region sets that are to be tested for overlap with the query set. LOLA includes a core reference database assembled from public data, including, for example, the CODEX database () and cross-tissue annotation of DNase hypersensitivity (). Alternatively or in addition, users can create problem-specific custom regions sets. To build a custom reference database, it is sufficient to collect text files with genomic coordinates (BED files) into a folder and to annotate them with descriptive names.
A simple exampleHere we analyze a set of the top-100 strongest EWS-FLI1 binding peaks from a previous study () and assess their overlap with public data. The query set and the LOLA core database are available from the LOLA website. queryA  readBed( " setA.bed " ) activeDHS  readBed( " activeDHS_universe.bed " ) lolaDB  loadRegionDB( " LOLACore/hg19 " ) result  runLOLA(queryA, activeDHS, lolaDB) result# View top results LOLA identifies all genomic regions from a query set that overlap with each region set in the reference database. This analysis is performed against a user-specified region universe, which is defined as the set of regions that could, in principle, have been included in the query set (e.g. subject to coverage constraints of the assay that was used to identify the query regions). By default, a single shared base pair is sufficient for regions to count as overlapping, but a stricter criterion can be chosen by the user. Next, considering each region as independent, LOLA uses Fisher's exact test with false discovery rate correction to assess the significance of overlap in each pairwise comparison (). The resulting rank score for each region set is then computed by assigning it the worst (max) rank among three measures: P-value, log odds ratio and number of overlapping regions. This ranking system emphasizes overlaps that do well on all three measures, and it tends to prioritize biologically relevant associations (). Results are returned as a data.table object (), providing a powerful interface to sort, explore, visualize and further process the results. In our example, the top hits accurately identify Ewing sarcoma specific regulatory elements. LOLA implements several helper functions to explore and export the results. All functions are described on the LOLA website with vignettes illustrating the basic and advanced features. In particular, a tutorial on manipulating the universe region set helps with configuring the most biologically relevant comparisons. Furthermore, the buildRestrictedUniverse() function automatically builds a universe based on query sets and can be used to test two region sets for differential enrichment against a reference database. LOLA facilitates large-scale comparisons by using optimized code for storing region sets and running vector calculations with the) and GenomicRanges packages (). It also uses database caching and multiple CPUs to speed up the analysis. These optimizations make LOLA analyses fast and memory-efficient, completing within a few minutes on a standard desktop computer. Gene sets are sometimes regarded as a universal language connecting genes, diseases and drugs. We anticipate that sets of genomic regions can similarly connect diverse types of genome, epigenome and transcriptome data to identify relevant associations in large datasets, thereby leveraging the broad investment into large-scale functional genomics and epigenomics for biological discovery. Such analyses can now be done easily and efficiently using LOLA.

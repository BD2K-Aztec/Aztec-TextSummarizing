Motivation: Quantitative and qualitative assessment of biological data often produces small essential recurrent networks, containing 3â€“5 components called network motifs. In this context, model solutions for small network motifs represent very high interest. Results: Software package NetExplore has been created in order to generate, classify and analyze solutions for network motifs including up to six network components. NetExplore allows plotting and visualization of the solution's phase spaces and bifurcation diagrams. Availability and implementation: The current version of NetExplore has been implemented in Perl-CGI and is accessible at the following locations: http://line.bioinfolab.net/nex/NetExplore.htm and
IntroductionThe analysis of biological systems using quantitative and experimental methods often produces small gene regulatory networks or network motifs which perform critical functions. Network motifs including 25 nodes became the major subjects of modeling and analysis (). Many types of network motifs have been identified and described (). However, even motifs with identical topologies (order of regulatory links) may produce surprisingly rich spectrums of dynamic solutions. Constraining network parameters given biological data is routinely used to model networks and network motifs; this approach has advantages and limitations. Major limitations include: (i) The availability of adequate biological data to fit the network parameters, (ii) overfitting problems, caused by imbalance between the amount of experimental data and the number of unknown parameters (). Constraining parameters may produce many alternative solutions. Recent progress in genomics and the accumulation of large amounts of high-throughput data allows reconstruction of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) and finding essential network motifs in silico (). Collection of data and validation of these predicted network motifs is difficult, but prediction of their likely behavior is desirable. Solutions may be obtained by assigning 'random' sets of parameters, centered on biologically relevant parameter values. Collection and classification of many 'emitted' random solutions predicts probable behavior of network motifs.
AlgorithmNetExplore includes three parts (modules): NetExplore Solver, NetExplore Browser and NetExplore Bifurcator. Each module is available online and as a standalone program for download. NetExplore Solver emits random sets of parameters for a user-defined network. NetExplore Browser explores solutions and visualizes their phase spaces. NetExplore Bifurcator carries out bifurcation analysis and displays bifurcation diagrams. Net Explore algorithm is based on the previously developed framework for GRNs (). A detailed description of the framework is available in Supplementary Material. Concentration of every component in the system is calculated based on a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) or stochastic differential equations (SDE), defined automatically by NetExplore. Synthesis of every x i component in the system is calculated from integrated inputs (P i , reflects the network topology), exponential decay and stochastic noise:In Equation (1), a, b and n define synthesis, decay and stochastic noise rate constants. Inputs from A activators and R repressors are integrated as follows:p inEquation (3) is similar to Hill function (). The model includes the following parameters: binding constant K, cooperativity C and number of binding sites N. System of ODEs describing network is automatically constructed and solved numerically by NetExplore.
Results and DiscussionNetExplore Solver provides options for network design. A user defines the number of network components, order and sign of regulatory links between the components. NetExplore Solver emits large number of solutions (standalone version has no limit on the number of solutions) and classifies them based on the number of dynamic attractors (monostable, bistable etc) and the presence of periodic signals (limit cycle attractors). Output of the NetExplore Solver is a list of solutions (parameter values), which may be analyzed, edited and passed to the second module, NetExplore Browser. NetExplore Browser can explore phase spaces for the selected solutions [see(A,B,E,F)], including analysis of the system in the presence of stochastic noise (and G). 'Adjust parameters' panel of NetExplore Browser provides options for model adjustment. The 'Bifurcate' button links NetExplore Browser to NetExplore Bifurcator, a program that carries out bifurcation analysis (and H) of a given model solution. The stand-alone version of NetExplore Bifurcator (see online help) can also create pictures, consecutively displaying evolution of the phase space in response to gradual adjustment of the model parameters. The frames can be combined into a video, such as the one shown here: https:// www.youtube.com/watch?va85upWytWwA. Collecting large a number of solutions (>10 4 ) and bifurcation analysis may require substantial time; therefore it may be desirable to use the standalone versions of Solver and Bifurcator.

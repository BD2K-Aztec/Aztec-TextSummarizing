Motivation: Recent technological advances revealed that an unexpected large number of proteins interact with transcripts even if the RNA-binding domains are not annotated. We introduce catRAPID signature to identify ribonucleoproteins based on physico-chemical features instead of sequence similarity searches. The algorithm, trained on human proteins and tested on model organisms , calculates the overall RNA-binding propensity followed by the prediction of RNA-binding regions. catRAPID signature outperforms other algorithms in the identification of RNA-binding proteins and detection of non-classical RNA-binding regions. Results are visualized on a webpage and can be downloaded or forwarded to catRAPID omics for predictions of RNA targets. Availability and implementation: catRAPID signature can be accessed at
IntroductionRNA-binding proteins (RBPs) use RNA-binding domains (RDs) to recognize target RNAs and to regulate co-/post-transcriptional processes. Examples of classical RDs include RNA-recognition motif (RRM), double-stranded RNA-binding domain (dsRRM), K-homology (KH), RGG box and the Pumilio/FBF (PUM) domain (). In addition to classical RDs, recent experimental studies on HeLa (), HEK298 () and mESC () cells, indicate that a number of RNA-interacting proteins contain non-classical RDs (ncRDs) for which annotation is not yet available. Discovery of new RDs is a challenging task: domaindetection tools, such as HMMER () and BLAST () rely on sequence similarity searches to identify annotated RDs and fail to recognize newly discovered RBPs. Similarly, other methods such as RNApred () predict RNAbinding ability using features of annotated RDs that might be different in ncRDs. Alternatives to identify RNA-binding regions include BindN (), PPRInt () and RNAbindR (), but the algorithms have been trained to identify single amino acids and not contiguous regions. catRAPID signature overcomes these limitations by (i) predicting the propensity of a protein to interact with RNA and (ii) identifying RNA-binding regions through physico-chemical properties instead of sequence patterns. The algorithm is an extension of the catRAPID approach () to predict protein-RNA interactions and the cleverSuite algorithm () to classify protein groups using physico-chemical features.
Algorithm and performancesTo build catRAPID signature we exploited a number of physico-chemical properties reported in our previous publication ():

Using a Support Vector Machine with RBF-kernel (online Documentation), we built a method for the (i) identification of ribonucleoproteins and (ii) prediction of RNA-binding regions:
Bioinformaticsi. catRAPID signature shows an AUC  0.76 for discrimination of 950 RBPs from 950 negative cases (10-fold cross-validation; Supplementary,). On an independent test set () comprising 47 mouse proteins harboring ncRDs and same number of negatives (), we obtained accuracy  0.71, sensitivity  0.70, specificity  0.72 and precision  0.70. By contrast, conventional pattern recognition methods such as HMMER and BLAST show poor sensitivity (). Our algorithm outperforms RNApred in both specificity and precision (0.25 and 0.52, respectively;). Moreover, catRAPID signature reliably detects ribonucleoproteins across different kingdoms, including M. pulmonis, E. coli, C. albicans, S. cerevisiae, A. thaliana and A. oryza (Supplementary; online Documentation). ii. The training for the identification of RNA-binding regions has been done on 1115 annotated RNA-binding regions. As negative counterpart we randomly selected 1115 non-binding regions of the same length from each RBP (AUC  0.80 in 10-fold cross-validation; Supplementary). On 102 ncRDs versus 102 negative mouse proteins, catRAPID signature outperforms other algorithms: accuracy  0.67, sensitivity  0.76, specificity  0.60 and precision  0.65 (Supplementary). By contrast, RNABindR  shows accuracy  0.48, sensitivity  0.53, specificity  0.42 and precision  0.48. Similar performances were obtained for BindN  and PPRInt (Supplementary). In addition, we observed high performances on a protein dataset whose RNA-binding sites have been determined through X-ray and NMR (Supplementaryand online Documentation).
Server description and exampleThe input of the server is a FASTA sequence. To illustrate the output with an example, we studied the RNA-binding ability of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein FMRP. catRAPID signature predicts that FMRP binds to RNA (overall interaction score  0.85;;) and correctly identifies two peaks corresponding to the KH domains and one peak in the RGG box () [,B and C; 'classical' score  0.73]. In addition, catRAPID signature indicates that the N-terminus (amino acids 1-215;) has RNA-binding ability ('putative' score  0.74), which is in agreement with very recent evidence revealing the presence of a novel KH domain (). Comparing experimental targets
ConclusionsAs newly discovered RDs are not annotated, traditional domaindetection tools fail their identification. catRAPID signature addresses this limitation by detecting binding regions through physico-chemical features. Our algorithm will be helpful to investigate components of ribonucleoprotein complexes and to identify RNA-binding regions.The server reports the propensity of FMRP for the putative (0.74), classical (0.73) and non-classical (0.57) RBP classes, as well as an overall prediction score (0.85); (B) The profile shows protein regions and their propensity to interact with RNA. catRAPID signature correctly identifies two peaks corresponding to the central KH domains, a region in the RGG boxat the C-terminus () and a recently discovered RD at the N-terminus (). (C) Annotated RDs are shown in a table and linked to PFAM webpages; (D) Annotated and predicted RNA-binding sequences can be downloaded and/or forwarded to catRAPID omics () for further analysis

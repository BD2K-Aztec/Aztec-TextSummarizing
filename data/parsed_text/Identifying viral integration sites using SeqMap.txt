Retroviral integration has been implicated in several biomedical applications, including identification of cancer-associated genes and malignant transformation in gene therapy clinical trials. We introduce an efficient and scalable method for fast identification of viral vector integration sites from long read high-throughput sequencing. Individual sequence reads are masked to remove non-genomic sequence, aligned to the host genome and assembled into contiguous fragments used to pinpoint the position of integration. Availability and Implementation: The method is implemented in a publicly accessible web server platform, SeqMap 2.0, containing analysis tools and both private and shared lab workspaces that facilitate collaboration among researchers.

Finding RISs using SeqMap 2.0(
T.B.Hawkins et al.each read and (iv) identify the appropriate reference genomes to which RISs should be mapped. The rest of the process is completely automated and data are returned to the user through secure login to a saved workspace or by email. Investigators are also able to use SeqMap 2.0 as a collaborative research tool by creating lab workspaces accessible to multiple users. SeqMap 2.0 is available at http://seqmap.compbio.iupui.edu/.

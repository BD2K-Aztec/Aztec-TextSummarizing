The previously disclosed QuantMap method for grouping chemicals by biological activity used online services for much of the data gathering and some of the numerical analysis. The present work attempts to streamline this process by using local copies of the databases and in-house analysis. Using computational methods similar or identical to those used in the previous work, a qualitatively equivalent result was found in just a few seconds on the same dataset (collection of 18 drugs). We use the user-friendly Galaxy framework to enable users to analyze their own datasets. Hopefully, this will make the QuantMap method more practical and accessible and help achieve its goals to provide substantial assistance to drug repositioning, pharmacology evaluation and toxicology risk assessment.

INTRODUCTIONUnderstanding interrelationships between drugs, toxins and other chemicals is an important part of discovering new ways to make better medicines, avoid toxicity or achieve any of a variety of goals for systems chemical biology (). For many applications, chemicals are commonly compared structurally according to computed or measured properties (). Another method is to compare the associations with biological systems. One notable application of this method is the connectivity map, which relates biologically active chemicals to gene-expression data (). Our published QuantMap method explores the connections of chemicals to proteins through proteinprotein networks (). In this article, we adapt the partially manual QuantMap method to a rapid automated system with an easy-to-use interface, opening up for moderately larger datasets as well as integration with other tools in batch analysis.
METHODS
Data sourcesChemical to protein relationships were taken from STITCH 3 () through the 'chemical.aliases.v3.1' and 'protein_ chemical.links.detailed.v3.1' tables available from http://stitch.embl.de. Protein to protein relationships (PPI data) were taken from STRING 9.0 () through the 'protein.links.detailed.v9.0' table available from http://string.embl.de. In both cases, taxonomy was limited to human (designated as 9606) for the current application. MySQL 5.5 (http://www.mysql.com) was used for building the local databases. Chemical identifiers (CIDs) and names generally correspond to PubChem (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) but are strictly limited to those found in STITCH 3.
Tools developedQuantMap automation has been implemented in the Galaxy platform () as a separate tool for data preparation and main calculation. The data preparation tool (named 'QuantMap Prep') was written in Perl (http://perl.org) for ease of text processing. This tool checks the list of input chemicals against the local STITCH database. Common names and CIDs known to STITCH are accepted and a table of acceptable CIDs with names is returned. Chemicals that cannot be found will be omitted from the next stage. The main QuantMap tool (named 'QuantMap Server') was implemented in R (http://www.R-project.org/) for access to network analysis tools. QuantMap Server approximates the procedure and parameters described inand outlined in the Supplementary. For each chemical (CID) cleared in the data preparation step:(1) Retrieve a list of 10 proteins ('seeds') closely associated with the current chemical from the local STITCH database. STITCH's overall score with a minimum confidence of 0.7 is used as the measure of association.(2) Retrieve a list of up to 150 proteins associated with these proteins (PPI data) from the local STRING database. STRING's overall score with a minimum confidence of 0.7 is used as the measure of association.(3) Calculate relative importance of the proteins in the PPI network as described in Section 2.3.(4) Condense the importance calculations to a single list ranked by the median of the importance measures.The ranked lists were combined using Spearman's foot rule (). This array of pairwise distances was analyzed by hierarchical clustering with hclust (complete) from the STATS package of R. *To whom correspondence should be addressed.  The Author(s) 2013.

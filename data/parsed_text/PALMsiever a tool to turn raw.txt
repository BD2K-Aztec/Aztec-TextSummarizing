During the past decade, localization microscopy (LM) has transformed into an accessible, commercially available technique for life sciences. However, data processing can be challenging to the non-specialist and care is still needed to produce meaningful results. PALMsiever has been developed to provide a user-friendly means of visualizing, filtering and analyzing LM data. It includes drift correction, clustering, intelligent line profiles, many rendering algorithms and 3D data visualization. It incorporates the main analysis and data processing modalities used by experts in the field, as well as several new features we developed, and makes them broadly accessible. It can easily be extended via plugins and is provided as free of charge open-source software.

To compensate for the presence of multiple detections of the same molecule in successive frames, PALMsiever also includes a grouping algorithm, where detections are grouped into single molecules according to spatio-temporal proximity. Cluster analysis of interacting biomolecules is enabled by a plugin for the density-based cluster analysis DBSCAN (), which also facilitates noise removal (, showing clustering of GaG-mEos2 data). Many rendering methods are available such as scatterplot, 2D histogram, blurred 2D histogram, automatic kernel density estimation (), Delaunay triangulation, jittered 2D histogram, hue-encoded depth and a novel occluding hue-encoded depth (, in the same order). Thanks to 3D data support across the software, 3D volumes can be easily exported to a TIFF stack, visualized as a 3D isosurface (), explored using slicing, or rendered using either the classical hue-based depth coding, or a novel rendering that correctly accounts for overlapping structures. As an alternative, data can also be exported for visualization with ViSP (El). PALMsiever has been designed with software interoperability in mind, so a number of predefined input file formats have been provided, e.g. QuickPALM (), RapidSTORM (), Leica SR GSD (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany), PeakSelector (courtesy of H.Hess, HHMI), uTrack (), Vutara (Vutara, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA) and Octane (). It can also easily be extended to import other file formats by adding new import filters or incorporate new analyses by writing plugins using MATLAB, and renderings can also conveniently be made available to the system clipboard or saved as TIFFs for inclusion in presentations or publications. The software is open-source and can be downloaded (together with example datasets) at http://code.google.com/p/palm-siever..

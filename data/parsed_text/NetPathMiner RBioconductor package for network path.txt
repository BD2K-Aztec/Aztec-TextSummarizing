NetPathMiner is a general framework for mining, from genome-scale networks, paths that are related to specific experimental conditions. NetPathMiner interfaces with various input formats including KGML, SBML and BioPAX files and allows for manipulation of networks in three different forms: metabolic, reaction and gene representations. NetPathMiner ranks the obtained paths and applies Markov model-based clustering and classification methods to the ranked paths for easy interpretation. NetPathMiner also provides static and interactive visualizations of networks and paths to aid manual investigation. Availability: The package is available through Bioconductor and from Github at
INTRODUCTIONMining subnetworks from genome-scale biological networks is an important step in biological data analysis because as their size and complexity increase, manual analysis becomes infeasible. Various methods for subnetwork mining from experimental data are available, where output subnetworks are expressed as sets of nodes (), frequent subgraphs () or linear paths (). We focus on linear paths, which are particularly useful by carrying an intuitive meaning, as in metabolic reaction paths and signaling cascades. Currently, software for mining paths from networks is hampered by two main challenges: (i) The lack of a universal parsing tool for different pathway types and database file formats. In fact, pathways can be diverse, such as metabolic or signaling, representing chemical conversions or protein interactions, respectively. Also, pathway information in databases can be accessed through different file formats, with each format representing pathway structure and annotation differently. (ii) The lack of effective visualizations for (a) different network types and (b) up to thousands of paths. Currently available tools are either specific to particular pathway types or file formats. An earlier approach, PathRanker (), is limited to mining paths from metabolic networks constructed from KGML files, providing static visualization on one network representation only. Tools like Pathview () and rBiopaxParser () also construct networks from only one file format. We present NetPathMiner, an R package, to overcome the two main challenges.describes the process flow implemented in our package (see next section and Supplementary Materials for details). NetPathMiner implements a flexible module-based process flow for network path mining and visualization, which can be fully integrated with user-customized functions. NetPathMiner enables fast processing for all KGML, SBML and BioPAX formats into genome-scale metabolic or signaling networks (See Supplementary Figures S1 and S2 in detail). NetPathMiner also provides path highlighting over three different representations and interactive visualizations, making the analysis of even thousands of output paths possible.
MAIN FEATURES2.1 Pathway file processing (Step 1 in)summarizes key differences among file formats supported by NetPathMiner. To alleviate these differences, NetPathMiner processes files into either one of the two outputs, regardless of input formats: (i) Metabolic networks, in metabolic representation, as a bipartite graph with metabolites and reactions parts, and edges representing production or consumption of metabolites. (ii) Signaling networks, in gene representation where vertices and edges represent genes and their interactions. NetPathMiner can merge multiple files into a single network.
Networkobjects and annotations. We chose igraph () to represent all constructed network objects in R to efficiently handle large graphs commonly encountered in biology and to allow NetPathMiner to integrate with other network analysis tools. NetPathMiner stores extracted annotations according to MIRIAM guidelines and implements an attribute fetcher using BridgeDb web service (van) to convert between different annotations.
Network representations (Step 2)For metabolic representation, NetPathMiner generates two other representations: (i) Reaction representation, where edges represent successive reactions, (ii) Gene representation, where vertices represent genes and edges represent participation in successive reactions. Multiple representations allow investigation of both chemical and genetic components of metabolic activity. *To whom correspondence should be addressed.
Weighting networks and path ranking (Steps 3, 4)Given a network in reaction or gene representations, edge weights can be computed by Pearson correlation, or a user-defined function, of expression profiles of adjacent genes. If gene expression is measured for different categories (control/treatment), edge weights can be computed for each category separately. From a weighted network, NetPathMiner ranks node sequences by two methods: (i) 'shortest path' () returning a list of k-maximum weighted paths, (ii) 'P-value' () returning the paths of which the sum of edge weights is significantly higher than that of random paths. Path ranking can be used independently or as a part of the entire process.
Clustering and classification of paths (Step 5)NetPathMiner provides machine learning methods to summarize output paths. Using Markov mixture models, paths can be clustered or classified according to their structure or association with a response label, respectively. Both methods are adopted from PathRanker ().
Visualization (Step 6)NetPathMiner provides both static and interactive visualizations of ranked paths using annotation information and machine learning techniques, making manual investigation easier.c show a visualization example of different graph representations using the output of the last step, allowing users to examine metabolic regulation at different biological system levels. Visualization function matches vertices across all input representations and plots them using the same layout. To make visualization of a huge number of paths clearer, NetPathMiner assigns the same color to all paths in each obtained cluster, and assigns the same color to vertices within the same cellular compartment (not shown).and e show vertices in each path as well as probability of each path belonging to clusters. NetPathMiner also supports interactive visualization in Cytoscape by either exporting networks in GML format or using RCytoscape (), which allows thorough investigation of vertex annotations and full customization of network colors and layout.
CONCLUSIONWe present NetPathMiner, an easy-to-use R package for network path mining. NetPathMiner constructs genome-scale networks from KGML, SBML and BioPAX files, overcoming the limitations of current tools. NetPathMiner summarizes output paths using machine learning methods and provides different visualizations, easing manual investigations. All modules in NetPathMiner can be used independently, particularly the pathway file processing module, and replaced with user-customized modules. Future developments include supporting other network representations, such as rule-based modeling formats, as inputs and outputs for broader integration.(rows) and their reactions (columns).

The miRror application provides insights on microRNA (miRNA) regulation. It is based on the notion of a combinatorial regulation by an ensemble of miRNAs or genes. miRror integrates predictions from a dozen of miRNA resources that are based on complementary algorithms into a unified statistical framework. For miRNAs set as input, the online tool provides a ranked list of targets, based on set of resources selected by the user, according to their significance of being coordinately regulated. Symmetrically, a set of genes can be used as input to suggest a set of miRNAs. The user can restrict the analysis for the preferred tissue or cell line. miRror is suitable for analyzing results from miRNAs profiling, proteomics and gene expression arrays.
INTRODUCTIONRecent miRNA discovery techniques confirmed the presence of hundreds of miRNAs in healthy and diseased tissues. Currently, approximately 900 miRNAs are reported in human and approximately 600 in mouse. It was shown that miRNA binding sites are not confined solely to 3-untranslated regions (UTRs), but also are found in coding regions and introns (). Furthermore, multiple features were shown to be imperative in regulation by miRNAs (). This led to a growing number of resources and algorithms that predict the pairing of miRNAs and their targets (). Currently, mirBase () is the most exhaustive collection of miRNAs with over approximately 15 000 mature miRNA sequences. miRBase collection () is based on MicroCosm algorithm. Additional exhaustive miRNA targets predictors include TargetScan () and PicTar (). Other large-scale resources for microRNAtarget pairing includes PITA (), microRNA.org that is based on miRanda algorithm (), DIANA-microT 3.0 (), miRDB () and ElMMO-MirZ (). For * To whom correspondence should be addressed.  The authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the first two authors should be regarded as joint First authors. a subset of miRNAstarget pairs, in vivo experimental validation is available in TarBase database (). We have developed miRror, an interactive tool for analyzing experimental results under the notion of coordination in miRNAs regulation. A coordinated regulation by several miRNAs was proposed [see discussion (. For a set of miRNAs, miRror outputs a ranked list of gene targets according to their likelihood to be targeted by the miRNA ensemble and vice versa for a set of regulated genes. miRror converts all predictor resources results into a unified platform by incorporating a statistical measure according to the hypergeometrical distribution. For example, in miRNAs overexpressing experiments in human cells (), 174 genes (miR-124) and 65 genes (miR-1) were downregulated and were used as input for miRror. The original miRNAs were identified as the top candidates with a P-value <3e-11 and with 9193% of the genes marked as targets for the relevant miRNA. Similar results were obtained by using only 50% of the gene lists, supporting the robustness of the miRror platform.
SYSTEM OVERVIEWmiRror is a platform by which an experimentalist can gain biological insights on sets of molecular entities. Such sets are the product of large-scale experiments such as miRNA profiling, mass spectrometry proteomics and gene expression data. miRror operates at a dual mode where ensemble of (i) miRNAs and (ii) gene targets/proteins are used as the input.
Prediction tools resources integrationDatabase files from multiple miRNAtarget prediction resources were separated to human, mouse and fly. The resources used include TargetScan, MicroCosm implemented in miRBase, PicTar, DIANAMicroT, PITA, ElMMO-MirZ, miRanda-based microRNA.org, TargetRank, miRDB and TarBase. miRror combines the resources following a conversion of the miRNAs and gene targets identifiers. RefSeq and UniProtKB identifiers are indicated as the primary entries. TarBase used as a validation resource rather then a prediction database.
miRtegrate analysismiRtegrate protocol is the core of miRror (). It calculates the probability of matches between miRNAs in the user list and the best set of targets derived from miRNAtarget predictions as reported by each of the selected resources. For each gene, wetake into account the list of miRNAs that were associated with it. We calculated the probability of the gene's interaction with the collection of miRNAs in the user set as opposed to the rest of the miRNAs in that database. The miRNAtargets coverage associated with each of the prediction resources is used for the calculation of a statistical significant threshold. We applied a default value of 0.05 as a threshold and calculated the P-value by considering all probabilities that are more significant that the threshold. P-value for miRNAs as input was performed according to the hypergeometric distribution with a correction for multiple testing. The same principle is applied with genes as input. For more details see the 'Help' section of the website.
microRNAs and their targets
Advanced options and filtrationThe miRror results are a ranked list of best predicted molecules (miRNAs or genes,). A refinement of the results is based on several advanced options. Several background distributions such as different tissues and cell lines can be applied for the miRtegrate calculations. Tissues are annotated by the gene expression data from FlyAtlas () and GNF atlas (). Using these optional backgrounds, new calculation for the P-value is activated to account for the apparent difference in coverage. The user can also select any subset of prediction resources to be used. A default parameter requires that a target will be selected by at least two databases. However, an intuitive option for changing the number of the miRror results is provided to the user by modifying all parameters (P-value threshold, minimal number of miRNAs that bind to each of the targets and minimal number of miRNAtarget databases). The web tool provides multiple sorting options, optional filtration thresholds and downloading options. Furthermore, results that are experimentally validated in TarBase are highlighted. The user can forward the results to a set of analysis tools to represent enriched pathways, networks and functional annotations ().
CONCLUSIONSWe present miRror as a novel integration scheme for a dozen of miRNAtarget prediction resources. miRror provides a double-sided view for ensembles of miRNAs or genes. Based on the notion of combinatorial regulation adopted by miRror, the reported list of targets for a miRNAs ensemble is a small subset of the inclusive list that is produced by the summation of predictors. As some miRNAs are predicted to pair with hundreds of targets, a reduction to a small but significant set of targets is valuable for the experimentalist. miRror application towards a set of genes as input is powerful in proposing potential miRNAs ensemble. Thus, the online tool can be used to generate hypotheses on the role of a specific genes or specific minimal set of miRNAs in any cellular settings.

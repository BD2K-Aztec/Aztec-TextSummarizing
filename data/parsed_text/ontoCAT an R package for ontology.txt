Motivation: There exist few simple and easily accessible methods to integrate ontologies programmatically in the R environment. We present ontoCATâ€”an R package to access ontologies in widely used standard formats, stored locally in the filesystem or available online. The ontoCAT package supports a number of traversal and search functions on a single ontology, as well as searching for ontology terms across multiple ontologies and in major ontology repositories. Availability: The package and sources are freely available in Bioconductor starting from version 2.8:
INTRODUCTIONThe R package ontoCAT was created to support basic operations on ontologies: traversal and search, uniform access to ontologies in OWL () and OBO () formats and to provide R access to major ontology repositories OLS and BioPortal. Several hundreds of public ontologies and numerous private ontologies for describing biological data exist today. Using ontologies in R () is difficult due to the lack of uniform package support. At the same time numerous Java-based ontology projects are available. ontoCAT takes advantage of a standard Java library with the same name 'ontoCAT' () to implement its functionality. The ontoCAT package: @BULLET gives unified, format-independent access to ontology terms and the ontology hierarchy represented in OWL and OBO formats;@BULLET provides basic methods for ontology traversal, such as searching for terms, listing a specific term's relations, showing paths to the term from the root element of the ontology, showing flattened-tree representations of the ontology hierarchy; and @BULLET supports working with groups of ontologies and with major public ontology repositories: searching for terms across * To whom correspondence should be addressed. ontologies, listing available ontologies and loading ontologies for further analysis as necessary.No other package with similar functionality exists at the moment in the R environment. The integration of the above functionality into R allows combining and automating ontology-related tasks. Different examples of ontology-related tasks that can be accomplished with the help of the ontoCAT package are given in the package documentation (http://www.ontocat.org/wiki/OntocatGuide): gene enrichment test and grouping of results, search and re-annotation of free-text to ontology and operations with relationships. ontoCAT has been included into Bioconductor, the main R open source project in bioinformatics. ontoCAT has been downloaded 347 times since its first release in December 2010. There is a large research community already using R to work with Gene Ontology (GO). Working with other ontologies is not as welldeveloped and ontoCAT helps to fill the gap.
METHODSThe ontoCAT R package consists of two main parts, grouping similar methods: @BULLET Single ontology traversal methods. @BULLET Methods to work across multiple ontologies.
Single ontology traversal methodsThe ontoCAT package can load an ontology in OWL or OBO format from a local file or on-the-fly from a URI. Reasoning over ontologies and extracting relationships is supported by using HermiT () reasoner. OBO ontologies are translated by OWL API () into valid OWL format that can be reasoned over. Ontologies can also be loaded from ontology repositories. Two public repositories are supported: BioPortal for accessing and sharing biomedical ontologies (), currently hosting 241 ontologies and the Ontology Lookup Service (OLS) for querying multiple ontologies (), currently hosting 81 ontologies. To load an ontology getOntology(path/accession) method of the Ontology class is available. It takes a single argument, specifying the local filesystem path, the full URI for the ontology file, or its OLS/BioPortal accession. The reference ontology supported by ontoCAT is Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO) (), developed for applications in functional genomics. The latest version of EFO can be loaded by using the method getEFO(). When an ontology is loaded, other ontoCAT methods become available.). In ontoCAT the subsumption 'subclass/superclass' is supported in a user friendly form of 'child  parent' relationship. No distinction is made between universals (classes) and particulars (instances) as they are both treated as ontology terms with parentchild relationship: class is treated as parent, instances are children of the class. The advantage of using a reasoner in ontoCAT is the ability to work with different relationships in addition to subsumption. However, if reasoning over ontology is not desirable getOntologyNoReasoning method should be used instead of getOntology method described above. An example of relationships that can be retrieved by ontoCAT starting from a particular EFO ontology term 'EFO_0000815' (heart) is given in. Below there are several examples of ontoCAT methods: @BULLET searchTerm(Ontology, 'myocardium') returns a list of terms where 'myocardium' is mentioned; @BULLET getTermParentsById(Ontology, 'EFO_0003087') lists parents of the term 'EFO_0003087' (atrial myocardium): 'EFO_0000819' (myocardium) (see); @BULLET getTermById(Ontology, 'EFO_0000819') returns ontology term by its accession: 'EFO_0000819' (myocardium); @BULLET getTermChildren(Ontology, term) lists children of the term 'EFO_0000819' (myocardium): 'EFO_0003087' (atrial myocardium) and 'EFO_0003088' (ventricular myocardium) (see); @BULLET showHierarchyDownToTerm(Ontology, 'EFO_0000819') prints out a flattened-tree representation of the ontology from the root term down to 'EFO_0000819'(A number of self-descriptive methods like showPathsToTerm(Ontology, term), isRoot(Ontology, term) are also available. The full list of methods together with descriptions is provided in online documentation (http://www.ontocat.org/wiki/r) and is included into the package.
Operations on multiple ontologiesontoCAT provides methods to work with groups or 'batches' of ontologies, local or web-based. Users can search for terms across such resources and load specific individual ontologies by accession. To create a local batch of ontologies the getOntologyBatch(path) method of the batch class is provided, taking a single argument: the path to the local directory containing ontology files. By default, a call to getOntologyBatch() without any arguments will load the EFO ontology. Ontologies can be added to an existing batch as needed via the addOntology(The ontoCAT package also provides methods to list ontologies in batches and to list ontologies available in BioPortal and OLS: listLoadedOntologies(batch), listOLSOntologies(batch) and listBioportalOntologies(batch). When the sought terms are found and term-specific operations (parent/child/other relationships retrieval, etc.) are needed, the getOntology(batch,accession) returns the ontology object for the concrete ontology with all single-ontology methods available.
TECHNICAL DETAILSThe package is based primarily on the Ontology Common API Tasks Java library, on the OWLAPI and depends on rJava R package. HermiT reasoner is used to support relationships. ontoCAT R package is open-source and is available under the Apache License Version 2.0. We provide two versions of ontoCAT:@BULLET Light-weight ontoCAT package version is available in Bioconductor (http://bioconductor.org) starting from release 2.7, and includes all single-ontology functionality except for methods to work with multiple ontologies and search in OLS and BioPortal. @BULLET Full version includes batch methods and due to package size limitations are available only from the project website.The package sources and full documentation are available at http://www.ontocat.org/wiki/r.
CONCLUSIONThe ontoCAT R package consists of convenient methods for working with ontologies in the R environment. The package has been successfully used in a number of
projects in the FunctionalPage: 2470 24682470
N.Kurbatova et al.Genomics Group at the European Bioinformatics Institute and this is its first public release. The package provides basic operations on ontologies represented in standard formats and enables searches in online ontology repositories: OLS and BioPortal.

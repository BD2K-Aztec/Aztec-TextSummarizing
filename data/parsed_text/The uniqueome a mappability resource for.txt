Quantification applications of short-tag sequencing data (such as CNVseq and RNAseq) depend on knowing the uniqueness of specific genomic regions at a given threshold of error. Here, we present the 'uniqueome', a genomic resource for understanding the uniquely mappable proportion of genomic sequences. Pre-computed data are available for human, mouse, fly and worm genomes in both color-space and nucletotide-space, and we demonstrate the utility of this resource as applied to the quantification of RNAseq data. Availability: Files, scripts and supplementary data are available from
and 90 nt with varying numbers of mismatches, in both nucleotide-space and color-space (Supplementary Material). To visualize the results, non-unique genomic regions are formatted as bigBED and bigWig files, and these can be loaded directly into the UCSC genome browser (Kuhn et al., 2009). The BED files are also compatible with large-scale genomic analysis using the Galaxy interface (Goecks et al., 2010). Figure 1 illustrates the utility of uniqueome in identifying problematic alignment areas in an RNAseq dataset (Guttman et al., 2010). Table 1 and Supplementary Tables S1S4 describe the proportion of unique start sites and unique coverage for different genomes and different tag lengths in both nucleotide-space and color-space. Interestingly, increasing the length of the tag beyond 50 bp does little to overcome redundancy issues in mammalian genomes, suggesting that short-read technologies do not need to progress significantly beyond their current lengths to achieve optimum utility in fragment datasets.

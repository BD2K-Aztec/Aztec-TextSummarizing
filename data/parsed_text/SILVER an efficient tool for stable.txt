INTRODUCTIONMass spectrometry (MS) has been applied in proteomics research for420 years. The great advantages in resolution, sensitivity and accuracy make MS the dominating technology in proteomics (). As the technology improves, MS-based quantitative proteomics has become an important research field in proteomics. Among the strategies developed for quantitative proteomics, stable isotope labeling strategies have been widely used thanks to their high accuracy and precision. Recently, several software tools have been developed for stable isotope labeling quantification, such as MSQuant () and Census (), the well-known software package MaxQuant () embedded with its own search engine, named Andromeda (), as well as a newly published quantification pipeline IsoQuant (), which was designed especially for stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) (). However, there has been little attention to quantitative quality control among these tools and there is hardly any proper algorithm focused on this issue (). On the other hand, the rapidly growing amount of large-scale quantitative proteomics data requires faster and more efficient tools. Here, we present a new efficient tool, named SILVER for stable isotope labeling data analysis with special considerations for quality control of quantification. SILVER introduces novel quantification confidence filters and indices, which finally result in accurate and robust quantification for stable isotope labeling experiments. Meanwhile, SILVER is fast and flexible by supporting different types of MS data such as the original raw files and the mzXML format files. SILVER takes the quality control results of PeptideProphet () or PepDistiller () as the input and provides user-friendly interfaces for parameter setting, result visualization, manual validation and some useful statistical analyses.
METHODSSILVER is designed for comprehensive labeling MS data analysis. The workflow of SILVER is shown in. The algorithms of SILVER are classified into three levels: the spectrum level, peptide level and protein level. For isotope cluster detection, SILVER uses a novel dynamic isotope matching tolerance algorithm for matching the experimental and theoretical isotope clusters. During the construction of extracted ion current (XIC) (Supplementary), the signal-to-noise ratio of each isotope peak, the goodness of least-square fitting between the theoretical and observed isotope distribution as well as the autocorrelation coefficient of the labeled and unlabeled isotope clusters are determined as quantification confidence filters at the spectrum level (Supplementary Methods). For peptide quantification, SILVER provides two novel quantification confidence indices: the Pearson and the Spearman correlation *To whom correspondence should be addressed. yThe authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the first two authors should be regarded as joint First Authors.coefficients between the labeled and unlabeled XICs, which are calculated as measurements of XIC shape and the intensity variation, respectively. For stable isotope labeling data with fractions such as reverse-phase liquid chromatography separation or sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, SILVER starts by integrating the XIC areas as the peptide quantification result. Then after a global linear normalization () and outliers rejection, a weighted average of peptide ratios () is adopted as the corresponding protein quantification result. Protein abundance is determined as the sum of its unique peptide intensities. Finally, the protein and peptide quantification results are shown in flexible tables (Supplementary), and some statistical analyses can be further performed in user-friendly interfaces (Supplementary Figs S3 and S4). More importantly, the labeled and unlabeled XIC plots of each peptide are provided for quantification validation manually (Supplementary). Meanwhile, to improve the efficiency of SILVER, a new data structure named IdxRaw is defined for fast accession of every spectrum (Supplementary).
RESULTSSILVER was developed for fast and accurate quantification of stable isotope labeling data. The quantitative accuracy of SILVER was evaluated and compared with MaxQuant (v1.3.0.5) and Proteome Discoverer (v1.3, Thermo Scientific) using a large-scale dataset named MaxQuant dataset as well as two standard datasets ( 15 N and 18 O labeling) () with different labeling ratios. For MaxQuant dataset, only commonly quantified proteins by the three tools were evaluated for an objective comparison. As shown in Supplementary, the median ratio of SILVER's result is the closest to the theoretical value compared with the other two software packages. For 18 O labeling dataset, SILVER performs as well as MaxQuant for the 1:1 labeling data, and its results are closer to the theoretical ratio for the 1:2 labeling data (Supplementary). What's more, SILVER can also handle 15 N labeling data that is another advantage over MaxQuant and Proteome Discoverer. There are three different ratios (H/L  1:2, 1:5, 1:10) in the 15 N labeling dataset. The protein ratio medians are all close to the theoretical values, suggesting the high accuracy and sensitivity of SILVER (Supplementary). These results demonstrate that SILVER is able to handle large-scale complex stable isotope labeling data and displays a high quantitative accuracy and sensitivity despite data complexity (Supplementary Methods). In addition, the quantification processing time of the three software tools is compared on MaxQuant dataset. As shown in Supplementary Table S1, the time consumed by SILVER is nearly one third of that consumed by MaxQuant and even nearly one tenth of that of Proteome Discoverer under the same computing conditions. More details are provided in Supplementary Methods.

CONCLUSION In summary, we have developed a new efficient tool named SILVER for stable isotope labeling LC-MS data quantification. By using the quality control methods, SILVER can provide accurate and sensitive quantification results for SILAC, 15 N and 18 O labeling data with effective validation, visualization as well as statistical analysis functions. Other labeling strategies such as isobaric labeling and multiplexed labeling methods will be included in future versions.

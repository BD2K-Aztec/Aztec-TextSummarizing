SMeagol is a software tool to simulate highly realistic microscopy data based on spatial systems biology models, in order to facilitate development, validation and optimization of advanced analysis methods for live cell single molecule microscopy data. Availability and implementation: SMeagol runs on Matlab R2014 and later, and uses compiled binaries in C for reactionâ€“diffusion simulations. Documentation, source code and binaries for Mac OS, Windows and Ubuntu Linux can be downloaded from http://
The purpose of SMeagol is to enable realistic comparisons between the output of advanced analysis methods and known ground truth. SMeagol includes an extended MesoRD (Fange et al., 2012) version for simulation of 3D diffusion in cellular compartments, diffusion limited reaction kinetics, surface adsorption, reactions in membranes and other complex aspects of reaction diffusion kinetics that do occur in cells, but are not considered in SPT analysis algorithms. In addition to the molecules' trajectories, SMeagol integrates the 3D point spread function of the microscope, the kinetics of photoactivation, blinking and bleaching of the simulated fluorophores, background noise and camera specific parameters (Fig. 1, movie S1 and S2). Great flexibility is allowed by the possibility to supply these characteristic parameters either as tabulated experimental data for a particular optical setup, or as theoretical models. The combination of using reaction diffusion kinetics in cellular geometries and physics-based simulations of the emission and detection processes makes the images more realistic than the synthetic data used for example by Chenouard et al. (2014). SMeagol can be used to optimize imaging conditions for specific systems in silico and to benchmark methods for SPT analysis in analogy with the methods that has been developed to benchmark localization methods for non-moving single particles (Sage et al., 2015). In the supplementary material, we explore the robustness against localization errors and motional blur of the vbSPT software, which V C The Author 2016.

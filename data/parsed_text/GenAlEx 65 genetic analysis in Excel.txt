GenAlEx: Genetic Analysis in Excel is a cross-platform package for population genetic analyses that runs within Microsoft Excel. GenAlEx offers analysis of diploid codominant, haploid and binary genetic loci and DNA sequences. Both frequency-based (F-statistics, heterozygosity, HWE, population assignment, related-ness) and distance-based (AMOVA, PCoA, Mantel tests, multivariate spatial autocorrelation) analyses are provided. New features include calculation of new estimators of population structure: G 0 ST , G 00 ST , Jost's D est and F 0 ST through AMOVA, Shannon Information analysis, linkage disequilibrium analysis for biallelic data and novel heterogen-eity tests for spatial autocorrelation analysis. Export to more than 30 other data formats is provided. Teaching tutorials and expanded step-by-step output options are included. The comprehensive guide has been fully revised. Availability and implementation: GenAlEx is written in VBA and provided as a Microsoft Excel
INTRODUCTIONGenAlEx 6 was originally developed as a teaching tool to facilitate teaching population genetic analysis at the graduate level (). GenAlEx operates within Microsoft Excelthe widely used spreadsheet software that forms part of the cross-platform Microsoft Office suite. Packaging genetic analysis within a familiar and flexible environment resulted in quick understanding and effective performance of population genetic analyses. Taking advantage of the rich graphical options available within Excel, GenAlEx offers a wide range of graphical outputs that aid genetic data analysis and interpretation. GenAlEx is now widely used by university teachers at both undergraduate and graduate levels around the world. Moreover, the software has also attracted a large number of researchers who utilize its unique features. Here we provide an update on the new features offered in GenAlEx 6.5 that we believe will be welcomed by students, teachers and researchers. GenAlEx offers population genetic analysis of diploid codominant, haploid, haplotypic and binary genetic data from animals, plants and microorganisms. It accommodates a wide range of genetic markers, including microsatellites (SSRs), singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), amplified fragment length polymorphisms and DNA sequences. Both allele frequencybased and distance-based analysis options are provided. The former includes estimates of heterozygosity and genetic diversity, F-statistics, Nei's genetic distance, population assignment and relatedness. The latter includes Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA), Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA), Mantel tests, TWOGENER, multivariate and 2D spatial autocorrelation. Readers are referred to Peakall and Smouse (2006) for a more comprehensive outline of these standard procedures, data formats and data import options. GenAlEx 6.5 maintains backward compatibility, but it provides access to the expanded spreadsheet of Excel 2007 onward. Thus, the maximum numbers of loci and samples are vastly expanded and only constrained by memory. More than 30 different Excel graphs summarize the outcomes of genetic analyses. Graphics can be further manipulated with Excel options and easily converted to pdf or other publication-quality formats.
NEW FEATURES
New estimators of population structureThere has been much recent debate about the utility of F ST as a measure of population genetic structure (). GenAlEx 6.5 offers the calculation of G 0 ST , G 00 ST and Jost's D est , providingstandardized allele frequency-based estimators of population genetic structure, following Meirmans and Hedrick (2011), testing the null by random permutation and estimating variances via jackknifing and bootstrapping over loci. New AMOVA routines now enable the estimation of standardized F 0 ST , following Meirmans (2006). The calculation of these statistics was validated by comparison with the software GenoDive v2.0b22 ().
Shannon's information statisticsShannon information indices have been widely used in ecology but largely overlooked in genetics despite offering a framework for quantifying biological diversity across multiple scales (genes to landscapes). GenAlEx offers the calculation of a series of *To whom correspondence should be addressed.  The Author(s) 2012. Published by Oxford University Press.

Shannonindices, including the mutual information index S H UA , an alternative estimator of population structure. The methods followwho assessed the performance of Shannon indices for estimating genetic diversity. Smouse andextend to multiple hierarchical levels, with a unique three-level partition option and statistical testing by random permutation offered in GenAlEx 6.5.
Tools for comparing pairwise population statisticsThe Mantel test capability of GenAlEx has been extended to allow multiple comparison among pairwise population statistics such as F ST , F 0 ST , G 0 ST , G 00 ST , D est and S H UA. This will allow informed comparison of the new estimators of population structure.
Heterogeneity testing for spatial autocorrelation
Linkage disequilibrium tests (LD) for biallelic dataDespite its importance, there is no universal test for disequilibrium (). GenAlEx 6.5 offers pairwise tests for disequilibrium between biallelic markers such as SNPs. When phase is known, this includes the calculation of D, D 0 , r and r 2 , following Hedrick (2005). Maximum likelihood estimation is used to calculate D and r when phase is unknown (). The results were validated against GDA (). Inclusion of LD fills an important technical gap, particularly for teachers. For large SNP sets, or multiallelic data, GenAlEx users are encouraged to take advantage of the options to export their data to other packages such as Arlequin 3.5 ().
New allele frequency formatRetrospective calculation of the new estimators of population structure such as G 0 ST , D est and Shannon indices are now possible from published allele frequency data. Teachers will also find this a helpful option for the re-analysis of textbook examples.
Import and export optionsGenAlEx offers data import from several popular formats and tools for importing and manipulating raw data from DNA sequencers. Export to more than 30 other data formats is provided, enabling access to myriad other software packages. For example, direct export is offered to programs such as GENEPOP () and STRUCTURE (), and via these same formats to many other programs, including genetic packages in R such as adegenet () and pegas (). The full list of export options, along with notes on the export process, can found at the website.

SPECIAL FEATURES FOR TEACHING Offering a user-friendly software package for university students and teachers remains an ongoing goal of GenAlEx. We continue to expand the popular step-by-step output options that allow students to follow the steps in the analytical pathway. Teaching-specific menu options are also provided. For example, the Rand menu allows students to permute and bootstrap hypothetical datasets with color tracking, to aid an understanding of how these statistical tests work. Finally, we have made freely available a set of tutorial notes and supporting datasets drawn from the graduate workshops that we have offered (both jointly and independently) around the world. 4 DOCUMENTATION More than 150 pages of documentation are provided. This includes Appendix 1 that outlines the statistical analyses used and their supporting references. The revised guide to GenAlEx 6.5 fully cross-links with the GenAlEx tutorials and Appendix 1. 5 CONCLUSION GenAlEx 6.5 offers a wide range of population genetic analysis options for the full spectrum of genetic markers within the Microsoft Excel environment on both PC and Macintosh computers. When combined with its user-friendly interface, rich graphical outputs for data exploration and publication, tools for data manipulation and export options to many other software packages, we believe that GenAlEx offers an ideal launching pad for population genetic analysis by students, teachers and researchers alike.

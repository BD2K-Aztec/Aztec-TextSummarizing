We recognize that the process is not perfect, and some outstanding work might have been rejected despite our best efforts. Nonetheless, we are hopeful that all authors received helpful feedback on their work and that most believed their submissions were judged fairly and diligently. In total, the two-tier review process involved 896 individual reviews. We are immensely grateful to the Area Chairs, the members of the program committee and the external subreviewers for their outstanding efforts in conducting a thorough review process in just 3 months. Their contribution is at the core of the scientific quality of the conference.

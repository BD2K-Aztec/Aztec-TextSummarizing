The task can be efficiently solved using Dijkstra's algorithm, but neither database is capable of casting queries as dynamic programming problems, although promising results have been achieved with automatic dynamic programming in declarative languages (Zhou et al., 2010). By contrast, the Cypher graph query language has a dedicated function for finding shortest paths, not taking into account edge weights. This leads to a massive speed improvement for this specific task: Neo4j is able to find the shortest path with no length constraint 2441 faster than PostgreSQL can find the shortest path when constraining the maximal path length to two edges.

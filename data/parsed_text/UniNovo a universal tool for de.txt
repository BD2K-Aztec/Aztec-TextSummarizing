Motivation: Mass spectrometry (MS) instruments and experimental protocols are rapidly advancing, but de novo peptide sequencing algorithms to analyze tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra are lagging behind. Although existing de novo sequencing tools perform well on certain types of spectra [e.g. Collision Induced Dissociation (CID) spectra of tryptic peptides], their performance often deteriorates on other types of spectra, such as Electron Transfer Dissociation (ETD), Higher-energy Collisional Dissociation (HCD) spectra or spectra of non-tryptic digests. Thus, rather than developing a new algorithm for each type of spectra, we develop a universal de novo sequencing algorithm called UniNovo that works well for all types of spectra or even for spectral pairs (e.g. CID/ETD spectral pairs). UniNovo uses an improved scoring function that captures the dependences between different ion types, where such dependencies are learned automatically using a modified offset frequency function. Results: The performance of UniNovo is compared with PepNovo√æ, PEAKS and pNovo using various types of spectra. The results show that the performance of UniNovo is superior to other tools for ETD spectra and superior or comparable with others for CID and HCD spectra. UniNovo also estimates the probability that each reported reconstruction is correct, using simple statistics that are readily obtained from a small training dataset. We demonstrate that the estimation is accurate for all tested types of spectra (including CID, HCD, ETD, CID/ETD and HCD/ETD spectra of trypsin, LysC or AspN digested peptides). Availability: UniNovo is implemented in JAVA and tested on Windows, Ubuntu and OS X machines. UniNovo is available at http://proteomics. ucsd.edu/Software/UniNovo.html along with the manual.
INTRODUCTIONDe novo peptide sequencing by tandem mass (MS/MS) spectrometry is a valuable alternative to MS/MS database search. In contrast to the database search approach that utilizes the information from proteome, the de novo sequencing approach attempts to identify peptides only using the information from the input spectrum. Hence, most de novo sequencing algorithms are based on the prior knowledge of the fragmentation characteristics (e.g. ion types and their propensities) of MS/MS spectra (). The fragmentation characteristics are highly dependent on the fragmentation method used to generate the spectrum. Among several fragmentation methods available, the collision-induced dissociation (CID) is the most commonly used method. Accordingly, the fragmentation characteristics of CID have been well studied compared with recently introduced fragmentation methods, such as electron transfer dissociation (ETD) and higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) (). As a result, many de novo sequencing algorithms have been introduced for CID spectra; for example, PEAKS () and PepNovo () are the state of the art de novo sequencing tools for CID spectra. Other fragmentation methods like ETD and HCD have a great potential for de novo sequencing. For example, for highly charged spectra, ETD provides better fragmentation and thus is better suited for de novo sequencing than CID (). Also, more complete fragmentation of peptide ions (especially in low mass regions) in HCD provides a better chance to obtain more accurate de novo reconstructions than CID (). Furthermore, modern mass spectrometers (e.g. LTQ-Orbitrap Velos) allow the generation of paired spectra (e.g. CID/ETD or HCD/ETD spectral pairs). Since CID (or HCD) and ETD spectra provide complementary information for peptide sequencing (), such spectral pairs (or even triplets) enable more accurate de novo sequencing. Several de novo sequencing algorithms were recently presented to take advantage of those new fragmentation methods. For instance,proposed a de novo sequencing algorithm for ETD spectra, which is used by PEAKS. For HCD spectra,introduced a de novo sequencing tool, pNovo, that not only takes advantage of the high precision peaks in HCD spectra but also uses the information of abundant immonium and internal ions. In case of spectral pairs,proposed a greedy algorithm (for CID/ECD spectral pairs) that significantly boosts the performance of de novo sequencing. Datta andpresented Spectrum Fusion, a de novo sequencing algorithm for CID/ETD spectral pairs. Spectrum Fusion constructs a combined spectrum from the input CID/ETD spectral pair using a Bayesian Network. It generates multiple de novo sequences using the combined spectrum and score them by the scoring function in ByOnic ().This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/), which permits non-commercial re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. For commercial re-use, please contact journals.permissions@oup.com algorithm, ADEPTS, for CID/ETD spectral pairs. Given a CID/ ETD spectral pair, ADEPTS first finds 1000 candidate de novo sequences from each spectrum, using PEAKS. The total 2000 candidate sequences are then rescored against the input spectral pair, and the best-scoring peptide is reported. While the above tools perform well for the spectra generated from the fragmentation method(s) that each tool targeted, they often generate inferior results for the spectra from other fragmentation methods. Moreover, if alternative proteases (e.g. LysC or AspN) are used for protein digestion, these tools may produce suboptimal results because different proteases often generate peptides with different fragmentation characteristics (). In case of the database search approach,recently introduced a universal algorithm MS-GFDB that shows a significantly better peptide identification performance than other existing database search tools such as Mascot  Percolator (). However, a universal de novo sequencing tool is still missing. We present UniNovo, a universal de novo sequencing tool that can be generalized for various types (i.e. the combinations of the fragmentation method and the protease used to digest sample proteins) of spectra. The scoring function of UniNovo is easily trainable using a training dataset consisting of thousands of annotated spectra. All information needed for de novo sequencing are learned from the training dataset, and the running time for training is 55 h in a typical desktop environment. Currently, UniNovo is trained for CID, HCD and ETD spectra of trypsin, LysC or AspN digested peptides. We show that the performance of UniNovo is better than or comparable with PepNovo, PEAKS and pNovo for various types of spectra. One of the biggest challenges in de novo sequencing is to estimate the error rate of the resulting de novo reconstructions. Unlike MS/MS database search tools that commonly uses the target-decoy approach () to estimate the statistical significance of the peptide identifications, de novo reconstructions have rarely been subjected to a statistical significance analysis in the past. Several de novo sequencing tools report the error rate of amino acid predictions (e.g. confidence scores in PEAKS), but this is often not sufficient because the overall quality of the sequence cannot be easily determined by the error rates of individual amino acid predictions. To our knowledge, only PepNovo reports the empirical probability that the output peptide is correct. PepNovo predicts the probabilities using logistic regression with multiple features of the reconstructions such as length and score, which are extracted from a training dataset consisting of hundreds of thousands of annotated spectra (). However, PepNovo does not include an automated training procedure (that would allow to easily extend PepNovo for newly emerging mass spectrometry approaches) and is currently trained only for CID [Extending PepNovo beyond CID spectra requires training complex boosting-based re-ranking models for predicting peak ranks and rescoring peptide candidates. PepNovo training includes several manual steps and the availability of a very large corpus of training spectra (. Thus, in case of non-CID fragmentation methods, it remains unclear how to obtain accurate error rate estimation for de novo reconstructions. UniNovo estimates the probability that each reported reconstruction is correct, using simple statistics that are readily obtained from a small training dataset. We demonstrate that the estimation is accurate for all tested types of spectra (including CID, HCD, ETD, CID/ETD and HCD/ETD spectra of trypsin, LysC or AspN digested peptides). This allows UniNovo to automatically filter out low quality spectra.
METHODSSimilar to, we first describe the algorithm on a simplified model that assumes the following: the masses of amino acids are integers (e.g. the mass of Gly is 57). the m/z (mass to charge ratio) of peaks (in spectra) are integers. the intensity of all peaks is 1. only N-terminal charge 1 ions are considered (e.g. b, c, or b  H 2 O ions, but not y-ion series). the parent mass (the mass of the precursor ion) of a spectrum equals to the mass of the peptide that generated the spectrum. While such a simplified model is impractical, we chose to introduce our algorithm on this model for better understanding of the algorithm on a more complex and realistic model. The algorithm on a more realistic model is described in the Supplementary section S2.
Terminology and definitionsLet A be the set of amino acids with (integer) masses m(a) for a 2 A. A peptide a 1 a 2    a k is a sequence of amino acids, and the mass of a peptide is the total mass of amino acids in the peptide. We represent a peptide a 1 a 2    a k with mass n by a Boolean vector P  P 1 ,. .. , P n , where P i  1 if i  P j t1 a t for 05j5k, and P i  0 otherwise. If P i  1, we call a mass i a fragmentation site. For example, suppose there are two amino acids A and B with masses 2 and 3, respectively. Then, the peptide ABBA has the mass of 2  3  3  2  10 and is represented by a Boolean vector (0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0). The fragmentation sites of this peptide are, thus, 2, 5 and 8. A spectrum is a list of peaks, where each peak is specified by an m/z. We represent a spectrum of parent mass n by a Boolean vector S  S 1 ,. .. , S n , where S i  1 if the peak of m/z i (or simply the peak i) is present and S i  0 otherwise (Representing peptides and spectra as vectors allows us to represent the generation of spectra from peptides by simple vector operations.). A peptide-spectrum match (PSM) is a pair P, S formed by a peptide P and a spectrum S. Given an integer called an ion type and a PSM P, S, we say a peak i is a-ion peak (with respect to P) if i  is a fragmentation site, that is, P i  1. In this model, the ion type can be any integer. In the connection to the experimental MS/MS spectra, ion types can represent common singly charged N-terminal ions; for example, the ion types 1 and 27 represent b and a ions, respectively. Given an integer f called a feature and a spectrum S, we say that a peak i satisfies f if another peak i  f is present in the spectrum, that is, S if  1. For instance, a peak 30 satisfies a feature f  18, if S 3018  1. In experimental spectra, various ions are often observed along with neutral losses (e.g. b-ion and b  H 2 O-ion) or with related ions (e.g. b-ion and a-ion). A feature describes the relation (the shift of m/z values in this simplified model) between two peaks that may correspond to a neutral loss or a mass gain/loss between related ions. For example, since we are dealing with only charge 1 ions, a water loss (from any ions) is represented by the feature f  18, and the mass gain from a-ion to b-ion is represented by the feature f  27. The possible interpretations of selected features are found in Supplementary Tables S5S37 in the Supplementary section S12.
Peptide-spectrum generative modelWe model how a peptide P of mass n generates a spectrum S. Apart from a 1-step generative model inor Kim et al. (2009a), we introduce a more adequate 2-step probabilistic model in which the dependency between different ions can be described. Assume that we are given the set of ion types (the ion type set ) and the set of features (the feature set F). For simplicity, we consider the case where only one ion type  0 is in  and one feature f is in F. Given a peptide P, a partial-spectrum s is generated per each element P i of P as follows: The probability that s i  1 is given by if P i  1 or by otherwise (the first generation step). This first step can be characterized by a 2  2 matrix called the ion type matrix (). When s i  1, the probability that s if  1 (i.e. the peak i satisfies f) is given by if P i  1 or otherwise (the second generation step). The second step is characterized by the feature-ion type matrix () (Given s i  0, the probability that s if  1 is assumed to be 0.). The second step can describe the dependency between different ions (or an ion and its neutral loss) from the same fragmentation site. If multiple ion types and multiple features are considered, the ion type matrix should be defined per ion type, and the feature-ion type matrix per ion type and per feature. The spectrum S is generated by taking elementwise OR operation for the generated partialspectra s.
Training UniNovoSince the ion type matrices and feature-ion type matrices fully describe the generation of a spectrum, in the training step, UniNovo learns these matrices from the training dataset (a set of PSMs). To define these matrices, the ion type set  and the feature set F should be formed. Using the offset frequency function introduced in, we collect frequently observed ion types and form the ion type set . To form the feature set F, we define the feature frequency function with which one can count how many times each possible feature is observed in the training dataset (see the Supplementary section S1.2). Using the feature frequency function, we collect frequently observed features and form the feature set F. From here on, we only consider ion types in the ion type set  and features in the feature set F. Next UniNovo learns the ion type and feature-ion type matrices that characterize the generative model of the PSMs in the training dataset. For example,  Prs i  1jP i  1 can be empirically determined if partialspectra s are given. However, it is not clear how to decompose a spectrum S into partial-spectra s (since partial spectra may share peaks in the spectrum). As a compromise, we learn PrS i  1jP i  1 for estimation of. Other probabilities are also empirically determined similarly by substituting the partial-spectra by the spectrum. We emphasize that all the above probabilities can be learned from a small set of PSMs (e.g. 5000 PSMs per charge state are often sufficient to avoid overfitting; see the Supplementary section S15) even if there are many ion types in  and features in F because each probability is associated to an individual ion type or a combination of an ion type and a feature, not a combination of multiple ion types and multiple features. Lastly, we compute the probability that a random element of a peptide vector is a fragmentation site, i.e., PrP i  1 [When masses of amino acids are rounded to integers, PrP i  1 % 1 121:6. However, if we consider more accurate amino acid masses (for the spectra of high resolution), this probability should be learned from the training dataset.. This probability is called the prior fragmentation probability and denoted by p. The detailed description of UniNovo training is given in the Supplementary section S1.
How to infer fragmentation sites from a spectrumGiven a spectrum S of parent mass n, our goal is to predict the fragmentation sites of the (unknown) peptide P that generated S. For simplicity, assume that there exists a single ion type  0 is in the ion type set  (but multiple features in the feature set F). Given a peak i, define H as the set of features that the peak i satisfies. Then the fragmentation sites are predicted by solving the following Bayesian inference problem. Fragmentation inference problem: Given the set of features H and P i such that PrP i  1  p (the prior fragmentation probability), derive the posterior probability PrP i  1jS i  S if  1 for f 2 H. Since we assumed that there is only one ion type, we have only one ion type matrix. On the other hand, per each feature we have a featureion type matrix. Let f and f denote and associated to the feature f, respectively. If we can assume that all features are independent(a) The generation of a partial-spectrum s for P i. One ion type  0 and one feature f are considered. The probability that s i  1 is given by if P i  1 or by otherwise. When s i  1, the probability that s if  1 (i.e., the peak i satisfies f) is given by if P i  1 or by otherwise. The spectrum is generated by taking elementwise OR operation for generated partial-spectra for all elements of P. (b) The calculation of the fragmentation probability vector F PV from a spectrum S (without knowing the peptide P that generated S). We consider one ion type  0 and two features f 1 and f 2. The events 'a peak satisfies f 1 ' and 'a peak satisfies f 2 ' are assumed to be independent. To derive F PV i , first we examine which features the peak i satisfies in the spectrum S. Denote the features the peak i satisfies by H. Second, given H, we calculate the probability that P i  1 [using the probabilities given in ion type matrix and feature-ion type matrixsee the equation(i.e., the events 'S i  S if  1 for f' are independent for f 2 H), we obtainwhere  PrP i  1jS i  1  p p1p (see the Supplementary section S3 for derivation). Denote the obtained probability in (1) as i. We define a fragmentation probability vector (F PV) as a vector with n elements such that F PV i  i if S i  1 0 otherwise 2 for i  1,. .. , n  1, and F PV n : 1 (see). F PV i is an estimated probability that P i  1 (see Supplementary Figs S3 and S4, blue bars). We use F PV for the generation of de novo reconstructions. The equation (1) is based on a simplified model in which a single one ion type and multiple independent features are used. However, some features are known to be strongly dependent on each other (e.g. a feature describing a single water loss and a double water losses), and usually multiple ion types are present in the ion type set. Thus, in practice, per each peak, UniNovo automatically selects a small number of features (510 out of thousands of features in the feature set) that are weakly correlated yet effective to determine the ion type of the peak. Assuming that the selected features are mutually independent, F PV is calculated per ion type using the equation (1), and then the final F PV is given by a weighted summation of the F PV's of different ion types. Note that there are many possible combinations of features due to the large number of all the features in the feature set (even if the number of the features to calculate F PV per peak is510). Since different combinations of features are selected for different peaks, UniNovo is able to use more diverse relations between different ions as compared with other tools that typically use fixed dependencies between ions (e.g. PepNovo). The detailed description and an example of the feature selection method and the calculation of F PV are given in the Supplementary section S3.
Generating de novo reconstructionsTo generate de novo reconstructions, we first construct a spectrum graph (). Given a spectrum S of parent mass n from an unknown peptide P, the spectrum graph GV, E is defined as a directed acyclic graph whose vertex set V consists of 0 (the source), n (the sink) and integers i such that F PV i 40. Two vertices i and j are connected by an edge i, j if j  i equals to the mass of an amino acid or the total mass of multiple amino acids (a mass gap). Any path from 0 (the source) to n (the sink) in a spectrum graph corresponds to a peptide (possibly containing mass gaps). We say that a vertex i is correct if P i  1 and an edge i, j is correct if both vertices i and j are correct. We also say that a path r is correct if all vertices in r are correct. The length of a reconstruction is defined by the total number of amino acids and mass gaps in the reconstruction. To score a de novo reconstruction, we use an additive (i.e., the score of a path is the sum of scores of vertices of the path) log likelihood ratio scoring [similar to. Given a vertex i, let F PV i  x. The likelihoods of the following two hypothesis for the outcome F PV i  x are tested: (i) the vertex i is correct and (ii) the vertex i is incorrect. Let PrP i  1jF PV i  x  x. Then, we haveThe score of the vertex i with F PV i  x is defined by Scorei : log x 1x  1p p  where  denotes the rounding to the nearest integer. Given a path r, the score of the path r is defined by P i2r
Scorei.Since an additive scoring is used, top scoring reconstructions can be efficiently generated using a dynamic programming as in. We did not exclude symmetric paths in the spectrum graph that usually correspond to incorrect reconstructions. Considering only the antisymmetric paths would further enhance the performance of UniNovo (). After generating the reconstructions, a probability that each reconstruction is correct (termed the accuracy of the reconstruction) is predicted, using Hunter's bound () (see the Supplementary section S4 for the definition of the accuracy of reconstructions). Hunter's bound can be calculated from relatively simple statistics that are readily learned from a small set of PSMs (about 5000 PSMs). Supplementary Figures S2 and S3 (green bars) in the Supplementary section S9 show that the accuracy of a reconstruction is a conservative estimate of the empirical probability of the reconstruction being correct.
RESULTS
DatasetsTo benchmark UniNovo, we used 13 different datasets with diverse fragmentation methods (CID/ETD/HCD), digested with diverse proteases (trypsin, LysC and AspN), and having diverse charge states (see) at 1% peptidelevel FDR without allowing any modification except the carbamidomethylation of Cys (C  57) as a fixed modification [In the Supplementary section S13, we also re-analyzed the dataset reported inthat contains doubly charged CID spectra identified using Sequest () and PeptideProphet (. Out of all identified spectra, we selected 1000 spectra (or pairs of spectra) from distinct peptides randomly and formed the 13 datasets listed in. The unselected identified spectra (about 5000 to 20 000 spectra depending on the type of spectra) were used for the training of UniNovo. The peptide contained in the training dataset were not contained in the above 13 datasets. See the Supplementary section S10 for the detailed description of these datasets.
Benchmarking UniNovoWe benchmarked UniNovo, PepNovo (ver. 3.1 beta) (), PEAKS (ver. 5.3, online) () and pNovo (ver. 1.1) () using the datasets in. For each tool, we generated N de novo reconstructions per each spectrum for N  1, 5 and 20. We say that a spectrum is correctly sequenced if at least one of N reconstructions generated from the spectrum is correct. To evaluate the performance of each tool, the number of correctly sequenced spectra and the average length of correct reconstructions were measured for each tool (Since mass gaps are allowed for reconstructions, often multiple correct reconstructions were reported for a spectrum. To calculate the average length of correct reconstructions, only the top scoring correct reconstruction was counted per a spectrum.). For UniNovo, the maximum number of mass gaps in a reconstruction was set to 2. UniNovo was tested for all datasets. For PepNovo, also N top scoring reconstructions were generated per spectrum. PepNovo was used for CID2, CIDL2, CIDA2, HCD2 and HCD3 datasets. In case of PEAKS, we first generated 500 top scoring reconstructions per each spectrum. Then, for each reconstruction we converted amino acids with the local confidence 530% into mass gaps. Such conversion is adopted because PEAKS generates reconstruction without mass gaps while UniNovo and PepNovo generate reconstructions with up to two mass gaps. In this procedure, multiple reconstructions without mass gaps were often converted into the same reconstruction with mass gaps. The score of a converted reconstruction is defined as the highest score of the reconstructions before conversion. Out of the converted reconstructions, N top high scoring (distinct) ones were chosen and used for further analysis. PEAKS was tested for all datasets except for HCD2 and HCD3 datasets. For pNovo, N top scoring reconstructions were generated per a spectrum (pNovo also generates reconstructions without mass gaps. However, the conversion of reconstructions as in PEAKS could not be applied to pNovo because pNovo does not report any local score.). Only HCD2 and HCD3 datasets were analyzed by pNovo. The parameters of each tool for each dataset is provided in the Supplementary section S8. We also indirectly compared UniNovo with MS-GFDB (), as both tools were developed to analyze diverse types of spectra. We replaced the scoring function of UniNovo with that of MS-GFDB and generated reconstructions using the replaced scoring method. More precisely, the spectrum graph was generated by MS-GFDB per each spectrum, and the reconstructions were generated by UniNovo on that spectrum graph (instead of the spectrum graph generated by UniNovo). This generation method is specified by MS-GFDBScore. All experimental parameters for MS-GFDBScore were the same as for UniNovo.shows the comparison results for different datasets. UniNovo found the largest number of correctly sequenced spectra among all the tested tools in most datasets. In particular, for ETD spectra, UniNovo reported significantly more correctly sequenced spectra than PEAKS. For example, in case of ETD2 or ETDL4 dataset, the number of correctly sequenced spectra was more than twice for UniNovo than for PEAKS. For CID spectra, UniNovo and PepNovo showed similar results. When N  1, UniNovo and PepNovo found about the same number of correctly sequenced spectra in CID2 and CIDL2 datasets, but UniNovo found about 35% more correctly sequenced spectra than PepNovo in CIDA2 dataset. While trypsin and LysC-digested peptides generate the spectra of similar fragmentation characteristics, AspN-digested peptides generate spectra with distinct fragmentation propensities. UniNovo worked well with AspN-digested peptides, but PepNovo showed suboptimal results for the spectra of AspN-digested peptides [Training of the parameters for the Bayesian network of PepNovo () for the CID spectra of AspN-or LysC-digested peptides would lead to better results; however, as mentioned above, the re-ranking models of PepNovo (), which are crucial for the superior performance of PepNovo for CID tryptic spectra (see the Supplementary section S14), cannot be readily trained.]. The length of correct reconstructions for PepNovo was slightly longer than for UniNovo. The results on HCD spectra also demonstrate that UniNovo finds the largest number of correctly sequenced spectra in general. The reconstructions reported by pNovo were, however, longer than those by UniNovo (and PepNovo) by two to three amino acids. This suggests that UniNovo still has room for improvement for HCD spectra (e.g. introducing features better reflecting the high mass resolution and information from immonium or internal ions). The results from UniNovo were superior to MS-GFDBScore in both terms of the number of correctly sequenced spectra and the average length of the correct reconstructions in all datasets. For each dataset, we drew the Venn diagrams of the correctly sequenced spectra (and Supplementary Figs S5S12) to see the overlaps of the spectra between different tools. For all datasets, the overlaps between different tools increase as N grows, as expected. Relatively small overlaps are observed for ETD spectra (as compared with CID or HCD spectra). It indicates that UniNovo may have been using some valuable featuresU n i N o v oof ETD spectra missed by PEAKS (and vice versa) and suggests that combining UniNovo and PEAKS results may potentially lead to a promising de novo sequencing approach. While the above results measure the sequence level accuracy, they do not directly show the amino acid level precision or recall. To measure the amino acid level precision and recall, the top scoring reconstruction was generated per spectrum for each tool (i.e. N  1). For this experiment, MS-GFDB was not tested, and the reconstructions of PEAKS were not converted using the local confidence. From the generated reconstructions, the number of (predicted) fragmentation sites and the number of correct fragmentation sites are counted. Also, since the spectra are annotated, we can count the number of all fragmentation sites in test sets. The precision and recall are defined by precision  #correct fragmentation sites #predicted fragmentation sites 4 recall  #correct fragmentation sites #all fragmentation sites in test sets : 5shows the precision and recall values of the tested tools for different datasets. For all datasets, UniNovo showed the highest precision value. But the recall values of UniNovo tended to be lower than others in particular for CID spectra. For ETD2 and ETDL4 datasets, UniNovoFig. 2. Comparison of de novo sequencing tools [as well as a database search tool MS-GFDB () tweaked for de novo sequencing]. Per each spectrum, N top scoring reconstructions were generated by), PEAKS (), pNovo () and MS-GFDBScore. MS-GFDBScore provides UniNovo with MS-GFDB's scoring function. The number of reported reconstructions per a spectrum (N) is set to 1, 5 and 20. A reconstruction is correct if all the fragmentation sites of the reconstruction are correct, and a spectrum is classified as correctly sequenced if at least one of the reconstructions generated from the spectrum is correct. Figures on the left side (a, c and e) show the number of correctly sequenced spectra in each dataset, and figures on the right side (b, d and f) show the average length of the correct reconstructions had higher precision and recall than PEAKS. These observations are consistent with the sequence level results above; higher precision of UniNovo resulted in more accurate reconstructions, and lower recall resulted in shorter reconstructions.Both the sequence level and amino acid level results suggest that specific types of spectra are more suitable for de novo sequencing than others. For instance, in general, HCD spectra generated more accurate and longer reconstructions (or higher precision and recall in amino acid level) than ETD spectra. Further evaluation. The Venn diagrams of the correctly sequenced spectra for CID2 (ac), ETD3 (df) and HCD2 (gi) datasets. For all datasets, the overlaps between different tools increase as N grows, as expected. Relatively small overlaps are observed for ETD spectra when compared with CID or HCD spectra. The Venn diagrams for other datasets are found in Supplementary Figures S5S12 in the Supplementary section S11Fig. 4. Comparison of de novo sequencing tools in terms of amino acid level precision (a) and recall (b). The definitions of precision and recall are given in (4) and (5), respectively of the scoring function (i.e., spectrum graph) of UniNovo for different spectrum types is found in the Supplementary section S14, where we also compared the spectrum graphs from UniNovo, PepNovo and MS-GFDB for CID2 dataset.
De novo sequencing of paired spectraUniNovo also can be used to sequence paired spectra (e.g. CID/ ETD spectral pairs). Given multiple spectra from the same precursor ion, UniNovo first generates a spectrum graph from each of the spectra and next merges the spectrum graphs into a combined spectrum graph, on which the reconstructions are generated (refer to the Supplementary section S5 for the spectrum graph merging algorithm). To benchmark UniNovo in de novo sequencing of paired spectra, CID/ETD2 and CID/ETD3 datasets were analyzed by UniNovo. From CID/ETD2 dataset, two additional datasets were generated: CID/etd2 and cid/ETD2 datasets. CID/etd2 dataset was formed by taking only CID spectra, and cid/ETD2 dataset by taking only ETD spectra in CID/ETD2 dataset. CID/ etd3 and cid/ETD3 datasets were generated similarly. For each dataset, we generated N  1, 5 and 20 top scoring reconstructions. The results are shown in. When precursor ions were doubly charged, the performance boost from the paired spectra was very modest. For N  1, 5, and 20, UniNovo reported 5% more correctly sequenced spectral pairs in CID/ETD2 datasets than in CID/etd2 dataset. The average length of correct reconstructions for CID/ETD2 dataset was slightly longer than for CID/etd2 dataset. In contrast, for triply charged spectra, the use of paired spectra was highly beneficial for generating more accurate reconstructions. For example, when N  1, UniNovo reported 100 and 50% more correctly sequenced spectral pairs in CID/ETD3 dataset than in CID/etd3 and cid/ETD3 datasets, respectively. The length of correct reconstructions typically increases by 12 amino acids by using the CID/ETD paired spectra.
De novo sequencing with quality filteringGiven a set of reconstructions generated from a spectrum, UniNovo estimates the probability that at least one reconstruction in the set is correct (i.e., a probability that the spectrum is correctly sequenced) based on the accuracies of reconstructions. The estimated probability is called the set accuracy (When multiple de novo reconstructions are reported, it is important to guarantee that one of them is correct.). Denote the set of reconstructions by R  fr 1 ,. .. , r N g. If the events 'r i is correct' for i  1,. .. , N are independent, the set accuracy is simply given by 1  Q N i1 1  Accuracyr i . However, since the reconstructions are often similar to each other, the dependency between reconstructions should be taken into account. To model this dependency, we assume Markov property between the events 'r i is correct' for i  1,. .. , N and compute the set accuracy. The derivation of the set accuracy is given in the Supplementary section S6. When the parameter N is set, one may want to choose N reconstructions with the highest accuracies to maximize the set accuracy. However, such a selection often results in a set of short reconstructions (because short reconstructions have relatively high accuracies). Since short reconstructions are not very useful in many cases (e.g. in follow-up homology searches), UniNovo uses a greedy algorithm to select long and accurate reconstructions. The inputs to the algorithm are the parameters SetAccuracyThreshold and N. The algorithm tries to form an output set of N reconstructions of set accuracy higher than SetAccuracyThreshold while maximizing the minimum length of the reconstructions (see the Supplementary section S7 for the description of the algorithm). If UniNovo fails to generate a set of N reconstructions with the set accuracy higher than SetAccuracyThreshold, it filters out the query spectrum. We set SetThreshold  0:8 and reanalyzed the datasets in. The maximum number of mass gaps per each reconstruction was set to 10. For each dataset, we measured the number of unfiltered spectra (termed qualified spectra) and the percentage of qualified spectra that were correctly sequenced (which is expected to be 80% since SetAccuracyThreshold  0:8). The average length of correct reconstructions was also measured.The results are given in. For all datasets, the number of qualified spectra increases sharply as the number of reconstructions N grows (). For example, UniNovo reported only few qualified spectra (55) from CIDA2 dataset when N  1. When N  20, it reported 4900 qualified spectra from the same dataset. In contrast to the dramatic changes in the number of qualified spectra, the percentage of qualified spectra that were correctly sequenced hardly changed across the datasets and the values of N (). As expected, the percentage was around 80% for all cases (including the datasets containing CID/ETD spectral pairs), which shows that the set accuracy reported by UniNovo is reliable.shows the average length of correct reconstructions. As N decreases, the average length also decreases. This is because shorter reconstructions (with higher accuracies) are chosen by UniNovo when N is small to achieve high set accuracy.
CONCLUSIONWe presented a universal de novo sequencing tool UniNovo that works well for various types of spectra. UniNovo can be easily trained for different types of spectra using only thousands of PSMs that typically can be obtained from a single MS/MS run. The experimental results show that UniNovo generates accurate and long de novo reconstructions from spectra of CID, ETD, HCD and CID/ETD fragmentation methods and spectra of trypsin, LysC or AspN digested peptides. We also showed that UniNovo is better than or comparable with other state of the art tools. As pointed out by Ma and Johnson (2011), de novo sequences not only are valuable for the analysis of the novel peptides that are not present in proteome databases but also can facilitate the homology-based database searches. Since the reconstructions reported by UniNovo contain mass gaps representing the total mass of multiple amino acids [termed gapped peptides (, MS-BPM algorithm () can be used for fast exact or homology searches (UniNovoMS-BPM). MS-BPM enables searches against a sequence database using gapped peptides as queries. Currently MSBPM takes gapped peptides generated by MS-GappedDictionary () (MS-GappedDictionaryMS-BPM). However, the reconstructions from UniNovo are usually longer than those from MS-GappedDictionary (89 versus 56). Since the search time of MS-BPM strongly depends on the length of gapped peptidesthe longer gapped peptides, the shorter search timethe running time of UniNovoMS-BPM is smaller than MS-GappedDictionaryMS-BPM by an order of magnitude in a blind search against the IPI Human proteome database ver.3.87 () (data not shown).. De novo sequencing with qualify filtering of spectra. Given a spectrum, if the parameter SetAccuracyThreshold is set, UniNovo attempts to achieve set accuracy (an estimated probability of the spectrum being correctly sequenced) exceeding SetAccuracyThreshold. If it fails to generate such a set, the spectrum is filtered out. An unfiltered spectrum is called a qualified spectrum. We set SetAccuracyThreshold  0:8.

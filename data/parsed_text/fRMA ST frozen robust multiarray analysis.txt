Frozen robust multiarray analysis (fRMA) is a single-array preprocessing algorithm that retains the advantages of multiarray algorithms and removes certain batch effects by downweighting probes that have high between-batch residual variance. Here, we extend the fRMA algorithm to two new microarray platforms—Affymetrix Human Exon and Gene 1.0 ST—by modifying the fRMA probe-level model and extending the frma package to work with oligo ExonFeatureSet and GeneFeatureSet objects. Availability and implementation: All packages are implemented in R. Source code and binaries are freely available through the Bioconductor project.

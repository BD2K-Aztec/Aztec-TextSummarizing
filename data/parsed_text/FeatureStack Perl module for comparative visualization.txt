INTRODUCTIONComparative analysis of gene structures is important for understanding gene function and evolution. To facilitate gene structure comparison, multiple related gene models need to be shown side by side in a single compact image. In addition, sequence features such as protein domains should be highlighted for functional annotation and to provide reference points for comparison (). Few specialized tools have been developed for the comparative visualization of gene structures, including FancyGene (), GECA () and GSDS (). FancyGene provides rich annotation options but is limited to the display of a single genomic locus and image generation cannot be automated. Conversely, GECA and GSDS allow rapid image generation for many genes, but options to highlight sequence features on top of gene models are limited. Here, we present two Perl modules, Bio::Draw::FeatureStack and Bio::Graphics::glyph::decorated_gene, which build upon existing BioPerl () and BioGraphics () functionality for the highly generic and versatile visualization of multiple gene structures. When used in combination, these two modules allow for fully automated and yet highly configurable image generation, which greatly facilitates comparisons of many gene structures.
METHODOLOGYFeatureStack takes an array of BioPerl feature objects as input; projects them onto a common coordinate space; flips features on the negative strand (optionflip_minus), removes untranslated regions (optionignore_utr); left-aligns them by start codon, protein domain or a user-defined offset (option feature_offsets); sets a fixed intron size (optionintron_size); removes unwanted transcripts (optiontranscripts_to_skip) and then draws a SVG or PNG image of the so transformed features using a user-specified glyph (optionglyph). Below is a brief synopsis for the use of FeatureStack:$feature_stack  new Bio::Draw::FeatureStack (-features 4 \@features # feature array-ref-glyph 4 'gene',-flip_minus 4 1,-ignore_utr 4 1,-panel_params 4 { # passed on to panel-width 4 1024,-pad_left 4 80,-pad_right 4 20,-grid 4 1 },-glyph_params 4 { # passed on to glyph-utr_color 4 'white',-label_transcripts 4 1,-description 4 1 } ); $png  $feature_stack-4png; # or-4svgInput features can represent BioPerl genes or transcripts with a three-tier (gene!mRNA!CDS/UTR) or two-tier (mRNA!CDS/UTR) level structure, respectively. The way features are retrieved is FeatureStack-independent and can, for example, be achieved using Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store or Bio::DB::GenBank, both BioPerl modules. FeatureStack was designed with the goal of providing maximum flexibility in image generation. As such, the user can control the output both via FeatureStack's own options and by providing panel-and glyph-specific parameters to fine-control all aspects of the rendering process.

Protein features can be specified in amino acid coordinates and will be automatically mapped to nucleotide coordinates. Please refer to the CPAN module description of decorated_gene for a detailed documentation of glyph options.showcases the functionality of FeatureStack and decorated_gene on the example of the regulatory factor X (RFX) transcription factor gene family (). Genes were ordered by their phylogenetic distance and automatically aligned horizontally by the start of the DNA-binding domain (shown in black), which represents their most conserved feature. Note that exons were drawn to scale, whereas introns were displayed with a fixed size of 50 bp to accommodate for the large intron size differences between species. By default, FeatureStack draws both exons and introns to scale. Differences in gene structure and features become evident once gene models are displayed with FeatureStack as shown in. For example, the DNAbinding domain can be encoded by one to three exons, and the transcription activation domain is only conserved in some human and fly genes. FeatureStack can also be used (optionalt_feature_type) to display various types of features associated with gene models, such as cis-regulatory elements or genomic variations. SupplementaryshowsFinally, we want to emphasize FeatureStack's usefulness in identifying atypical members of a gene family, pointing towards biologically interesting family members or gene prediction errors (Supplementary).

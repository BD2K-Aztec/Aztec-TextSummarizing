				<p>Motivation: Cytosine DNA methylation is one of the major epigenetic modifications and influences gene expression, developmental processes, X-chromosome inactivation, and genomic imprinting. Aberrant methylation is furthermore known to be associated with several diseases including cancer. The gold standard to determine DNA methylation on genome-wide scales is &apos;bisulfite sequencing&apos;: DNA fragments are treated with sodium bisulfite resulting in the conversion of unmethylated cytosines into uracils, whereas methylated cytosines remain unchanged. The resulting sequencing reads thus exhibit asymmetric bisulfite-related mismatches and suffer from an effective reduction of the alphabet size in the unmethylated regions, rendering the mapping of bisulfite sequencing reads computationally much more demanding. As a consequence, currently available read mapping software often fails to achieve high sensitivity and in many cases requires unrealistic computational resources to cope with large real-life datasets. Results: In this study, we present a seed-based approach based on enhanced suffix arrays in conjunction with Myers bit-vector algorithm to efficiently extend seeds to optimal semi-global alignments while allowing for bisulfite-related substitutions. It outperforms most current approaches in terms of sensitivity and performs time-competitive in mapping hundreds of millions of sequencing reads to vertebrate genomes.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Cytosine DNA methylation is one of the major epigenetic modifications in eukaryotes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Esteller, 2005</ref>). The epigenetic modification pathways governing DNA methylation and histone modifications are strongly coupled with each other (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cedar and Bergman, 2009</ref>). Hypermethylations in promotors of genes are associated with stable repression of its activity (as in case of * To whom correspondence should be addressed. X-chromosome inactivation) that can be maintained throughout cell divisions (<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Weber and Schübeler, 2007</ref>). During mammalian development, methylation patterns are largely rearranged. In very early stages, methylation marks are erased to allow flexible short-term regulation by histone modifications, while wide-spread de novo methylations in later stages enable long-term silencing of pluripotency-related or imprinted genes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Reik, 2007</ref>). In mammalian genomes, DNA methylation also ensures genomic integrity by inactivating and immobilizing transposable elements and hence preventing chromosomal instability, translocation, or gene disruption (<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Weber and Schübeler, 2007</ref>). In cancer cells, this overall stable landscape of DNA methylations is heavily distorted by widespread and massive hypomethylations, e.g. in repetitive sequences, and by silencing of tumor-suppressor genes by hypermethylating their promotors (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Esteller, 2007</ref>). Capturing DNA methylations on genome-wide scales in high resolution has become technically and economically feasible only with the advent of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies. DNA methylations are commonly captured either by sequencing methylated DNA that was isolated by antibodies or proteins, as in methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Weber et al., 2005</ref>) and methyl-CpG binding domain-based (MBD) isolated genome sequencing (<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Serre et al., 2010</ref>), or by sequencing DNA reads treated with sodium bisulfite to selectively convert unmethylated cytosines to uracils (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Frommer et al., 1992</ref>). Since the first approach merely enriches sequencing reads with methylation marks by pull down with antibodies or proteins, it is not possible to accurately pinpoint frequency, exact location, and sequence context of the modifications. The isolation procedure is further biased towards enrichment of highly methylated regions (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lister and Ecker, 2009</ref>). Sequencing techniques based on bisulfite treatment, on the other hand, facilitate single-base resolution, so that the methylation state of each single cytosine can be analyzed. Thus, they are capable of detecting intermediate methylation levels in heterogeneous samples or imprinted genes. One drawback of this method is the fact that hydroxymethylated cytosines, present in some mammalian cell types, cannot be distinguished from methylation marks after conversion with sodium bisulfite. The role of the hydroxymethylation is not yet known but it might be involved in demethylation or alterations of the chromatin structure (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Huang et al., 2010</ref>). Due to its high resolution and the possibility of unbiased genome coverage, bisulfite sequencing has been established as the 'gold<ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. Possible read types (+FW, +RC, −FW and −RC) in bisulfite sequencing protocols. Methylated and unmethylated cytosines in the genomic sequence (left) are coloured in red and blue, respectively, and positions in the read sequences (right) derived from genomic cytosines are coloured correspondingly. Note that the intermediate conversion of unmethylated cytosines into uracils after bisulfite treatment is omitted standard' method to capture DNA methylation. In the earliest approach of this type, reduced representation bisulfite sequencing by<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Meissner et al. (2005)</ref>, genomic regions with CpG dinucleotides are enriched by prior digestion with MspI. More recent protocols avoid this bias. Both methylC-seq (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lister et al., 2009</ref>) and BS-seq (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cokus et al., 2008</ref>) are protocols for the construction of the bisulfitetreated libraries for HTS. They mainly differ in their amplification procedure: while methylC-seq involves only a single amplification, BS-seq uses two amplification steps to ensure only fully bisulfiteconverted sequences to be amplified and hence sequenced. In BS-seq, first, adapters containing unmethylated cytosines are ligated to the DNA fragment. After treatment with sodium bisulfite, the first amplification is performed using primers complementary to fully bisulfite-converted adapters, then digested with DnpI and again amplified using common Solexa adapters. This results in four different types of bisulfite reads: +FW and +RC from the plus strand and −FW and −RC from the minus strand (<ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>). In case of methylC-seq, only two of these read types (+FW and −FW) may occur and are expected to be sequenced at similar rate. Beyond the extensive study of<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lister et al. (2009)</ref>as part of the UCSD Human Reference Epigenome Mapping Project, the methylomes of silkworm (<ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Xiang et al., 2010</ref>), honey bee (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lyko et al., 2010</ref>); and Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Li et al., 2010</ref>) have been analyzed by means of bisulfite sequencing. Moreover, this technology has been applied to identify methylation variations in epigenetic domains across cancer types (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hansen et al., 2011</ref>). Standard DNAseq mapping algorithms may run into problems when dealing with the potentially high number of converted cytosines in bisulfite sequencing reads: the bisulfite conversion causes a large number of mismatches between read and reference genome that should not be penalized. The asymmetry of the resulting matching rule, i.e. a genomic cytosine should match a thymine in the read but not vice versa, complicates the issue. Early bisulfite mapping methods used very time-consuming strategies. BSMAP (<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Xi and Li, 2009</ref>), for instance, iterates over all possible C/T conversions, CokusAlignment (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cokus et al., 2008</ref>) uses an exhausting tree search with base probability vectors. More recent methods either allow for asymmetric bisulfite-related mismatches, typically implemented by means of hash-tables as in MAQ (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Li et al., 2008</ref>) and RMAP (<ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Smith et al., 2009</ref>), or use a collapsed alphabet so that the asymmetry is disregarded altogether. In the latter type of methods, each cytosine is converted to a thymine (or guanine to adenine to match the minus strand) in the reads and in the genomic sequence. Both BS Seeker (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chen et al., 2010</ref>) and Bismark (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Krueger and Andrews, 2011</ref>) use Bowtie (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Langmead et al., 2009)</ref>to map the converted strings using different alignment policies. The resulting alignments are then post-processed to recover the methylated positions. None of the available tools can account for insertions and deletions (indels) in the read alignment. This is a major drawback since indels are known to be the predominant error type in 454 sequencing data and small indels contribute significantly to the genetic variation in human (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mills et al., 2011</ref>). Overall, currently available bisulfite mappers may not be able to cope with higher error rates potentially caused by erroneous PCR clones, low-quality reference genomes, extensive allelic variations, or mapping to the genome of a closely related organism. For example, the amphioxus genome exhibits substantial allelic variation with 3.7% SNPs and 6.8% polymorphic indels (<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Putnam et al., 2008</ref>). In the Ciona intestinalis, another important model organism, the average SNP rate is 1.2% but the variations are not uniformly distributed and locally increase to 10–15% within windows of 100 nt (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Dehal et al., 2002</ref>). segemehl is an efficient read mapping tool based on suffix arrays that readily accommodates indels using an extended version of the matching statistics (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hoffmann et al., 2009</ref>). In this study, we demonstrate that the mapping of bisulfite sequencing data can be incorporated into the framework using a hybrid approach that combines seed searches in the suffix array on a collapsed alphabet with optimal semi-global alignments around seed matches using a specialized extension of Myers bit-vector algorithm.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Seed search on collapsed alphabet</head><p>Our matching strategy uses seeds that serve as anchors for subsequent semi-global alignments (see Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S1</ref>). The seed search is efficiently facilitated in segemehl by an enhanced suffix array (ESA;<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abouelhoda et al., 2004</ref>). The ESA data structure supports exact query searches with an effort proportional to the length m of the query sequence and largely independent of the size of the reference genome. Our method aims to identify seed matches starting at each position. To improve the sensitivity of the seed search in the presence of sequencing errors, a limited number of mismatches as well as indels (insertions and deletions) is evalutated. For the technical details, we refer to<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hoffmann et al. (2009)</ref>. To facilitate efficient mapping of bisulfite-treated sequencing data, it is necessary to cope with a high number of bisulfite-related mismatches. To overcome this issue, the nucleotide alphabet is collapsed to three characters. To enable the seed search on both strands, two reference genomes and their corresponding ESAs, one with C-to-T and one with G-to-A conversions, are created. Since forward (C-to-T) and backward (G-to-A) ESA can be used consecutively, only disk storage but not core memory is affected. The reduced alphabet requires somewhat longer seeds to ensure unambiguous matches, leading to an increase in runtime by a small constant factor compared to ordinary read matching.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Myers bit-vector algorithm</head><p>After seed matching, segemehl calculates semi-global alignments of the query with the reference genome loci indicated by the seeds using the fast bit-vector algorithm of Myers (1999). To prevent spurious hits, segemehl uses a user-defined accuracy threshold (option-A) specifying the minimal required percentage of matchesmismatches + indels at a rate of 5% were randomly introduced into the bisulfite reads. The recall rate is the relative number of mapped reads where the score of the best alignment is found to be unique and the original position on the artificial reference was recovered correctly. The recall rate was estimated on subsets of the artificial reads with limited number of introduced mismatches or mismatches + indels. The overall recall rate of each program with the entire query dataset is given in the legend. Note that the preprocessing time is not included in the measurement within the calculated read alignment. By default, segemehl reports all read matches where the minimal accuracy criteria is met. In case of best-only (option-H 1), only those read matches are reported whose alignment contains the minimal number of errors (mismatches+insertions+deletions) among all matches. To efficiently cope with bisulfite conversions, we further extended the bit-vector algorithm of Myers to fully support the nucleic acid code of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) which encodes nucleotide ambiguity, e.g. the IUPAC nucleotide symbol 'Y' denotes either cytosine or thymine. By means of the IUPAC nucleotide code, bisulfite-sensitive alignments can be computed where asymmetric bisulfite-related conversions are implicitly treated as matches. The overhead of this extension of Myers' algorithm is only nominal, see Methods for further details. Overall, the major advantage of this mapping strategy is that, in contrast to other bisulfite mappers, no post-processing of the mapping is required.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Evaluation on artificial data</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mapping of bisulfite-treated sequencing data</head><p>physical memory is lower than the virtual memory consumption. For example, segemehl requires ∼ 5.2 GB of virtual but only 3.2 GB of physical memory. To verify that the superior sensitivity of segemehl does not lead to a substantial loss of mapping specificity, we counted the number of false positive mappings in each artificial benchmark. Among the uniquely mapped reads with &lt; 13 mismatches+indels, segemehl does not report a single false positive mapping. Thus, by limiting the number of permitted errors and restricting to uniquely mapped reads, segemehl does not lose specificity while achieving very high sensitivities. To assess whether higher mapping sensitivities may also assist in calling the methylation state more accurately, we assembled additional methylation calling benchmarks. The datasets with an expected 10-fold coverage were composed of 2.5 million bisulfite reads, mimicking the methylC-seq protocol, which were randomly selected from a 10 MB large reference sequence where 50% of the cytosines on each strand have been artificially methylated. Furthermore, errors (mismatches or mismatches + indels) were introduced in the read sequences at different rates (5, 10 and 15%). To assess the performance of re-calling, these artificial methylation states using the mapping output, we mapped each dataset with each of the bisulfite mapping tools, filtered out ambiguously mapped reads and determined the methylation states using simple majority voting under a minimal coverage of 5, see Section 4 for further details. For each dataset and mapping tools, recall rates and false discovery rates at different score cutoffs were estimated (see<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>and Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. S3</ref>). Overall, the methylation calls using segemehl's mapping output obtained higher recall rates at a lower false discovery rate in every setting compared with the other mappers. For example, with low and medium error rates (5% and 10%), it is possible to recover &gt; 95% of the methylation marks correctly with segemehl whereas the recall rates of methylation calls using the output of RMAP, MAQ and Bismark vary between 80% and 90%. In the most challenging scenarios with high error rates (15%), the mapping output of segemehl can still be used to infer the methylation state of &gt; 84% and 93% of the cytosines with D = 0 and D = 1, respectively, while retaining FDRs &lt; 0.1%. In addition, we simulated bisulfite reads from an artificial genome containing sites with four different methylation rates (20, 40, 60 or 80%). We estimated the methylation rates and calculated the differences from the simulated levels (error) for the alignments of each program. Errors of the segemehl based estimator were compared with estimators based on other alignment methods. Overall, with segemehl alignments, the accuracy of the estimated methylation rates is superior to the other tools tested—in particular in benchmarks with higher error rates (see Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S4 and S5</ref>). We emphasize that methylation calling is primarily a statistical problem inherently distinct from read mapping. Hence, we used here simple benchmark settings with uniform methylation patterns and sequencing errors. Partial chemical conversion, for instance, may reduce the sensitivity of a simple methylation calling procedure such as majority voting and call for a more sophisticated statistical model. It does not affect, however, the mappability of individiual reads.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Mapping of real-life data</head><p>Next, we compared the bisulfite mapping tools on two real-life datasets. Both SRR019048 (15 331 851 reads of length 87) and</p><p>(a) ( b), with each program to a 10 MB large reference sequence, see Section 4 for details on generation and evaluation of the datasets. The inlay in the left panel magnifies the area where the FDR is close to zero (same units on axes). Note that the same colours and symbols are used in both panels. The peak recall rates with 10% mismatches (left panel) are 0.966 and 0.952 for segemehl with D = 1 and D = 0, respectively, 0.8 for RMAP, 0.9 for MAQ and 0.871 for Bismark. In case of 15% mismatches (right panel), the peak recall rates are 0.933 and 0.843 for segemehl with D = 1 and D = 0, respectively, 0.385 for RMAP, 0.614 for MAQ and 0.52 for Bismark SRR019597 (5 943 586 reads of length 76) are part of the whole genome shotgun bisulfite sequencing dataset of the human H1 cell line by<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lister et al. (2009)</ref>. segemehl clearly outperforms the other programs in both datasets by reporting more mapped reads with a lower number of errors. The results including running time, memory usage, fraction of unique best mapped reads and fraction of unique best mapped reads at a given maximum error cutoff are given in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. The latter measure makes it possible to determine whether a higher overall number of mapped reads is merely reached by allowing more errors in the read alignment or whether it is obtained by also mapping more reads with few errors indicating better mapping capabilities of the method. segemehl is able to map an additional number of ∼ 234000 and ∼ 88000 reads from the datasets SRR019048 and SRR019597, respectively, with only up to two mismatches, insertions or deletions. Only a small difference in the number of mapped reads is observed between segemehl's D = 0 and D = 1 options. Similar to the artificial benchmarks, the number of mapped reads with BS Seeker is significantly lower compared with RMAP, MAQ and Bismark, which show similar results in both real-life datasets. By allowing non-unique mappings, segemehl is able to obtain mappings for &gt; 98% of the reads in each of the real-life datasets. In addition to these rather challenging datasets due to their poor base calling qualities, we analyzed a recent bisulfite dataset with good base calling qualities by<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lister et al. (2011)</ref>and obtained concordant results (see Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table S1</ref>). Strikingly, the running time of segemehl is lower compared with RMAP, MAQ and Bismark even for the sensitive D = 1 parameter setting. The increase varies from 13% to 189% for SRR019048 and SRR019597. The less sensitive setting comes with a 26-fold and 18-fold decrease in the running time compared with MAQ. In addition, RMAP and MAQ, in contrast to the other programs including segemehl, do not support multi-threading and hence cannot benefit from commonly available multi-core machines. ThisThe tests assessed the performance of segemehl with D = 0 or D = 1 (-F 1,-H 1,-A 70), BS Seeker (-t N,-e 80,-m 3), RMAP (-B,-m 20), MAQ (-M c,-n 3,-e 500) and Bismark (–directional,-n 3,-e 500) by mapping two lanes of a whole genome shotgun bisulfite sequencing dataset of the human H1 cell line (published by<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lister et al. 2009</ref>) against the human genome in terms of running time (in user mode), peak virtual memory consumption and fraction of unique best mapped reads (overall or subdivided by the maximal number of mismatches + indels in the alignment). Note that last measure only considers read mappings where the score of the best alignment is found to be unique. The best value in each measure, e.g., lowest running time, lowest memory consumption or highest number of unique best mapped reads, is printed in boldface. The real-life datasets consists of 15 331 851 reads of length 87 nt and 5 943 586 reads of length 76 nt in case of SRR019048 and SRR019597, respectively. Note that the preprocessing time is not included in the time measurement. Details on the selected parameters of each program are given in Section 4. a Virtual memory consumption shown whereas the required physical memory considerably less. For example, segemehl uses only ∼ 52 GB of physical memory. b RMAP and MAQ do not provide multi-threading. is a major technical shortcoming in the light of the size of datasets to be mapped. The high mapping accuracy and speed is paid for by the rather high memory consumption, which exceeds that of the other tools by a factor of five to ten: the ESA of the human genome used by segemehl consumes ∼ 73 GB of virtual memory but only 53 GB of the physical memory. The software thus requires equipment at the top end of what at present can be considered standard hardware. At the cost of higher running time, it is also possible to run segemehl on each chromosome separately with a peak memory consumption of 6 GB of RAM. Detailed information on merging the mapping output of each chromosome, updating sequence alignment map (SAM) tags, and enforcing (if desired) the best-only matching strategy is given on our website together with the necessary tools.</p></div>

Due to the short read length of ancient sequencing data, trimming of 5 and 3 end of reads may not be adequate and impede their mappability. By simply adjusting the conversion functions, this version of segemehl can also be applied to datasets generated with the PAR-CLIP protocol where protein binding sites can be identified genome-wide at high resolution by use of UV cross-linking and photoactivatable nucleosides such as 4SU or 6SG. These are specifically converted near cross-linking and hence binding sites and might assist in post-processing to reduce the number of false positives. By regarding these specific conversions as matches, segemehl becomes insensitive to the number of these conversions under any parameter setting. We have not investigated the performance of segemehl on these types of sequencing data so far. They are, however, a natural objective of future research.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Seed search</head><p>In segemehl, the seed search is facilitated by use of the ESA as described in<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hoffmann et al. (2009)</ref>. In brief, the concept of suffix array is based on lexicographically sorting all suffixes of the genomic sequence. By additionally using lcp-table and child table, the ESA is equivalent to a suffix tree (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abouelhoda et al., 2004</ref>). The suffix tree is a directed rooted tree in which edges are labeled with a non-empty string such that each suffix is formed by the concatenation of edge labels of exactly one path from the root to a leaf. Hence, a simple seed search in the ESA can be imagined as topdown traversal of the corresponding suffix tree with the query sequence. To facilitate imperfect seed searches and hence allow for mismatches, insertions and deletions, it is possible to enumerate alternative paths along the perfect matching path. However, the number of alternative matching paths increases exponentially with higher numbers of permitted errors. Hence, for the sake of time efficiency, the number of errors during seed search is limited. To perform seed searches at each query position, a greedy substring search was implemented. This approach uses suffix link information on previously computed matching paths and hence avoids recomputations. To construct an ESA, first, the suffix array table is generated by sorting all suffixes of the genomic sequence using the algorithm introduced by<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ko and Aluru (2003)</ref>. Second, the additional tables, namely lcp table, child table, and suffix link table, can be efficiently constructed according to<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abouelhoda et al. (2004)</ref>. Overall, the construction of an ESA index requires O(n) in time where n denotes the length of the genomic sequence. For DNAseq and RNAseq reads, the seed search is performed on a fourletter nucleotide alphabet, DNA ={A,C,G,T }, in both read and genome sequence. In the case of mapping bisulfite sequencing reads, the substitutions of genomic cytosines to thymines in the read sequence need to be taken care of during the search and should not be penalized as errors. Considering these bisulfite conversions explicitly would imply a potentially exponential enumeration and hence hamper the mapping performance considerably. We therefore introduce two conversion functions f C→T and f G→A such that</p><formula>f C→T (x) = T x = C x otherwise f G→A (x) = A x = G x otherwise</formula><p>where x ∈ DNA. In the first stage of the algorithm, the f C→T converted reads are mapped to a reference that has been converted with f C→T. To consider bisulfite conversion on the minus strand, it is necessary to additionally map the read converted with f G→A to the f G→A converted reference in the second stage because DNA methylations are strand-specific. Note that by mapping the four-letter alphabet to a three-letter alphabet bisulfite-related conversions appear as matches but at the same time the asymmetry of the substitution leads to an implicit underestimation of the edit distance.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig.2.</head><figDesc>Fig. 2.

			<note place="foot">To evaluate the performance of the bisulfite version of segemehl, we compared it with existing methods on artificial and real-life datasets. The artificial query datasets were composed of 10 million reads of length 80 nt randomly selected from a 200 MB large reference sequence. The reference itself was generated with a uniform nucleotide distribution and randomly methylated cytosines on both strands at a rate of 50%. To mimick the methylC-seq protocol, only +FW and −FW reads were generated from each strand of the reference. The sodium bisulfite treatment was simulated by converting each unmethylated cytosine on the reference into a thymine. We remark that segemehl can also map bisulfite sequencing data generated with the BS-seq library preparation protocol of Cokus et al. (2008). In this case, the mapping is extended to both strands with each of the alphabet conversions rather than only C-to-T on the plus strand and G-to-A on the minus strand of the genome sequence. The sensitivity of segemehl on artificial datasets mimicking the BS-seq library preparations are very similar to the results on methylC-seq datasets (data not shown). To consider genomic aberrations such as mutations and polymorphisms as well as sequencing errors, we further introduced random sequence errors into the bisulfite reads at different error rates (5 and 10%) and for error types (mismatches or mismatches and indels at the ratio 4:1). In our benchmark, we compare segemehl v0.1 with RMAP v2.05, BS Seeker, MAQ v0.7.1 and Bismark v0.5.1. We executed all programs with default parameters but adjusted some options, e.g. error limits and filtering constraints, to obtain more sensitive mappings and hence to assess the capability of each approach to cope with more difficult settings, see Section 4 for further details on parameters and the evaluation procedure. Overall, segemehl obtained recall rates &gt; 92% (with D = 1 difference allowed in the seed) and 81% (for exact seed matches) in every setting and hence outperforms all other programs in this respect. In the least challenging scenario with low mismatch rate (5%), all programs except for BS Seeker are able to recover the original position of &gt; 89% of the reads correctly (Supplementary Fig. S2a). By increasing the mismatch rate (10%), the recall rates of other programs drop considerably down to 60 and 70%. segemehl still achieves a recall rate &gt; 93% (D = 1) and 82% (D = 0). Among the other programs, MAQ performs best and is only slightly inferior to segemehl in its less sensitive setting (Fig. 2a). As for the introduction of indels into the read data, segemehl largely retains its good performance, while a substantial loss is observed with the other tools (Fig. 2b and Supplemantary Fig. S2b). This is also true in case of the artificial dataset with the low error rate (5%) including only few indels (Fig. 2b). In more challenging scenarios, the recall rates of these programs even drops &lt; 40% (Supplemantary Fig. S2b). segemehl obtains the higher recall rates at the cost of a reduced time performance. On average, segemehl with D = 1 is ∼ 5fold slower than with D= 0. Hence, the choice of this parameter is a tradeoff between speed and recall and is dependent on the user&apos;s requirements. The running times of MAQ and BS Seeker are comparable to segemehl with lower sensitivity whereas RMAP is about four times faster. In terms of memory, the programs consume between 2.6 GB (in case of BS Seeker) and 5.6 GB of virtual memory (in case of MAQ). Note that the actual amount of used</note>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> DISCUSSION The analysis of bisulfite sequencing data has remained a challenging problem. Existing tools either do not provide an all-in-one solution but are based on post-processing output of common mapping tools (e.g. Bowtie) leading to losses in sensitivity, or show undesirable runtime performance—in particular for vertebrate datasets. In addition, none of the existing tools is able to consider insertions or deletions and even very few indels, e.g., originating from sequencing errors or genomic variations, effectively obstruct the mapping of sequencing reads. We have presented here a novel approach to this problem based on segemehl to efficiently perform bisulfite mapping with high sensitivity. Our method is insensitive to contaminations and handles insertions and deletions already during the initial seed search. Compared with competing methods, our approach provides significantly higher recall rates as measured on artificial datasets. Although the recall rate of most other tools is drastically reduced by a larger number of mismatches or a few indels in the read data, these effects only slightly affect the sensitivity of segemehl. This increase in sensitivity does not come at the cost of specificity and may finally result in better performance in calling methylation state or methylation level as well. The algorithm is specifically designed to map also ambiguous reads. In some application scenarios, these reads are of interest and convey useful biological information. For example, repetitive elements were reported to be hypermethylated (Weber and Schübeler, 2007) but may be extensively demethylated during development (Gehring et al., 2009) or tumorgenesis (Esteller, 2007; Watanabe and Maekawa, 2010). Due to its highly time-efficient index structure, segemehl has strong advantages over the existing methods in mapping real-life datasets of human both in terms of sensitivity and running time, at the expense of a higher memory requirements. By supporting multithreading, the software can furthermore take full advantage of multiprocessor architectures and completes mapping of &gt; 540 million sequencing reads (SRX006240 dataset by Lister et al., 2009) on the human genome in only around three and a half days using a two Quad-core machine with 64 GB of core memory. It further supports mapping of bisulfite sequencing data from both currently existing library protocol, methylC-seq and BS-seq, and provides output in standardized SAM format for which various post-processing utilities are available such as samtools (Li et al., 2009). In addition to mapping bisulfite sequencing data, our approach might also assist in mapping ancient DNA (Briggs et al., 2007;</note>

			<note place="foot" n="4">.2 Bisulfite-sensitive semi-global alignment Following the seed search in the ESA, segemehl extends the seeds to semi-global alignments. In contrast to the seed search on the converted references, the alignment should use the asymmetric bisulfite matching rule where a genomic cytosine and thymine in the read produces a match but not vice versa. For this purpose, we extended the highly efficient bitvector algorithm of Myers (1999). Instead of computing only one entry in the dynamic programming matrix at a time, this algorithm computes w entries simultaneously where w as the word size of the machine. It takes advantage of the high efficiency of low-level bit operations due to bit-level parallelism in common processors. Thus, the core of Myers&apos; bitvector algorithm is entirely based on bit operations including differentiating between matches and mismatches which are initially precomputed and stored in bit-vectors. For each character x of the alphabet DNA , a bit-vector B x of length m is constructed where m denotes the length of the read sequence r. Subsequently, the bit-vectors are initialized by a function in such a way that i-th bit in B x is set iff x and the i-th character of r produce an alignment match. This algorithm has runtime of O((m/w)·l) where l is the length of the read and reference substring. In our implementation, the reference substring is bounded by m+2·k where k is defined by the maximal permitted errors in the read alignment. Hence, the algorithm has a runtime complexity of O((m/w)·(m+2·k)) in time. Since w = 64 in our implementation, the algorithm runs in O(m+2·k) for reads of size up to 64. Commonly, the function to differentiate matches and mismatches simply tests for character equality. Here, it was extended to fully support the IUPAC nucleotide code. For example, the IUPAC symbol Y, denoting a pyrimidine, produces a match with both C and T. By converting Ts into Ys within the read sequence, the asymmetric bisulfite matching rule is implicitly integrated. Again, due to the strand specificity of DNA methylations, read sequences matching to the minus strand are translated differently, i.e., every adenine in the read is converted into an R, the IUPAC symbol for a purine. Overall, the necessary modifications only concern the initialization procedure and hence result merely in nominal overhead.</note>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Benchmarking procedure</head><p>With a few exceptions, all programs were executed with default parameters for artificial and real-life datasets. Some options, such as error limits and filtering constraints, were adjusted to obtain a higher sensitivities. We executed segemehl in default mode, where at most one mismatch or indel is permitted in the seed (option-D) and where the maximum expectation value (option-E) is set to five. In addition, we also executed segemehl in a less sensitive but more time-performant configuration with-D 0. Seeds with &gt; 500 matches in the genome are dismissed by default (option-M). Due to the high number of read errors, the minimal required alignment accuracy (option-A) was adjusted to 80% and 70% in artificial and reallife benchmarks, respectively, and segemehl was set to report best-scoring hits only. For BS Seeker, MAQ, and MAQ, we permitted the maximum of three mismatches to obtain optimal sensitivity and adjusted the option-e in BS Seeker to the largest read length occurring in the benchmarks. In the same vein, the maximum number of mismatches was used for RMAP (-m 20). To avoid hits to be discarded due to the sum-of-base-qualitiespolicy, MAQ was executed with the option-e 500. The parameters were set analogously for Bismark. In contrast to BS Seeker, RMAP or Bismark, where non-unique best mapped reads (regarding their alignment score) are dismissed by default, MAQ reports a best hit in any case but assigns a mapping quality of zero in case multiple hits with equal score (sum of base qualities at mismatch positions) were found. Such ambiguously best mapped reads were rejected before any of the evaluations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C.Otto et al.</head><p>For each program, artificial, and real-life datasets, we assessed running time (in user mode), peak virtual memory consumption and recall rate in mapping the different datasets on the same machine with two 2.27 GHz 64-Bit Quad-Core CPUs and 126 GB of RAM. The time and the memory measurements were performed using unix ps. Note that the preprocessing times for generating index structures like the ESA or Burrows–Wheeler transform are not included in the measures. We estimated the recall rate as the relative number of reads where the score of the best alignment is found to be unique (i.e. unique best mapped reads) and the original position on the artificial reference was recovered correctly. However, optimal read alignments under the unit cost model may become ambiguous with insertions and deletions. Therefore, any reported position with a deviation of less than 11 nt from its original position was deemed as correct. In addition to the overall recall rate of each program in the datasets, we calculated the recall rates at a given maximum number of read errors (mismatches or mismatches+indels). Note that the number of errors in the optimal read alignment may be smaller than the number of introduced errors. For example, an unmethylated cytosine that is converted to thymine during the bisulfite treatment but subsequently called as cytosine due to a base calling error will not affect the alignment score. For each program, we illustrated the overall running time and memory consumption as well as the recall rate of these subdatasets as function of their maximal number of introduced errors (and Supplementary). In the artificial methylation benchmarks, all programs were executed as described earlier and the mapping output of each mapper was used to call the methylation states. To ensure a fair comparison, we implemented a simple methylation caller based on majority voting. Given the position of a cytosine, the list of bases within read sequences, which uniquely map to this position on the same strand, commonly denoted as cross-section, is extracted and the most frequent base in the cross-section is determined. If there is a tie or the most frequent base is neither C nor T, the cytosine is not called and hence counted as false negative (FN). If the most abundant character is C or T, the cytosine is called methylated or unmethylated, respectively. The methylation call is counted as true positive (TP) if the call matches the artificial methylation state and counted as false positive (FP) otherwise. To limit the number of false positives, only cytosine sites were called where the coverage on the strand exceeded a given minimal value. We further calculate the methylation rate, that is the fraction of non-converted over the sum of non-converted and converted bases. The entire methylation caller is by construction unaware of any particular features of the mapping tools. We provide the methylation caller as additional file. It uses the output generated by mpileup from the samtools package which can easily be created from any SAM-or BAM-formatted mapping output. By estimating the recall rate, that is TP/(TP+FN), and false discovery rate, that is FP/(TP+FP), we can compare the performance in methylation calling using the mapping output of each bisulfite mapper.</p></div>

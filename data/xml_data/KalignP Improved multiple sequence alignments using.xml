				<p>Kalign2 is one of the fastest and most accurate methods for multiple alignments. However, in contrast to other methods Kalign2 does not allow externally supplied position specific gap penalties. Here, we present a modification to Kalign2, KalignP, so that it accepts such penalties. Further, we show that KalignP using position specific gap penalties obtained from predicted secondary structures makes steady improvement over Kalign2 when tested on Balibase 3.0 as well as on a dataset derived from Pfam-A seed alignments. Availability and Implementation: KalignP is freely available at</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The alignment of multiple sequences is essential for many tasks in sequence analysis, e.g. protein structure and function prediction, similarity search and phylogenetic analysis (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Pei, 2008</ref>). Due to the importance of multiple sequence alignment (MSA) in a variety of biological applications, a number of programs have been developed. Three aspects are usually considered when developing an MSA program, the alignment accuracy, the computational speed and the memory usage. Kalign2 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Lassmann et al., 2009</ref>) is one of the fastest MSA methods, and still the alignment accuracy is comparable to many of the slower methods. Moreover, it produces high quality alignments consistently when aligning large number of sequences, i.e. Kalign2 is well suited for MSA tasks in large-scale genome analysis. However, in contrast to other methods such as ClustalW (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Thompson et al., 1994</ref>), Kalign2 does not allow externally supplied position specific gap penalties (ESPSGP).<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Thompson et al. (1994)</ref>showed that gaps occur far more often between major secondary structure elements than within. Also gaps are much more frequent in disordered regions of proteins. For integral transmembrane (TM) proteins, residues are more conserved at TM regions and few gaps are allowed within (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Kauko et al., 2008</ref>). * To whom correspondence should be addressed. Further, the inclusion of ESPSGP allows some inclusion of expertise knowledge into the alignment procedure. Here, we introduce KalignP as a modified version of Kalign2 that accepts ESPSGP. Unlike ClustalW, where ESPSGP is only applicable to profile alignments, KalignP incorporates ESPSGP into sequences and forward them to the full progressive alignment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Implementation of KalignP</head><p>KalignP inherits the syntax of Kalign2 but extends its functionality for protein sequence alignment. The ESPSGP can be supplied in the Enhanced Fasta format (see Supplementary Material) so that gap penalties are set individually for each position. The default gap penalties will be replaced by ESPSGP when aligning two single sequences. Gap penalties of profiles (consensus of sequences) are calculated in the same way as Kalign2 but ESPSGP will be used instead of the constant gap penalty. KalignP also inherits one of the best merits of Kalign2: low memory consumption. Since KalignP uses the same progressive method as Kalign2, it consumes almost the same amount of memory as Kalign2. KalignP takes about 50% more CPU time than Kalign2 for the alignment itself. The KalignP package, including automatic secondary structure prediction and ESPSGP calculation from secondary structures predicted by PSIPRED_single (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Jones, 1999</ref>) (version 3.2), is about 15 times slower than Kalign2, but this speed is still comparable to many other MSA programs such as ClustalW and Muscle (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Edgar, 2004</ref>), see<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>and Supplementary Material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Estimation of ESPSGP from predicted secondary structure</head><p>The principle to estimate ESPSGP from the predicted secondary structure is simple: increase the gap penalty at helices and sheets while lowering the gap penalty at coils. ESPSGP for position i is set as</p><formula>ESPSGP(i) = GP default * 1.0+m(i) (1)</formula><p>where m(i) is a variable to adjust the gap penalty at residue i based on the predicted structural information, see Supplementary Material for details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RESULTS</head><p>We benchmarked KalignP using gap penalties from predicted secondary structure with other methods on Balibase 3.0. KalignP outperformed Kalign2 on all five reference-sets (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). The results were evaluated by SP (Sum-of-Pairs) score and TC (Total Columns) score (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Thompson et al., 2005</ref>). SP score is the sum of scores of the projected pairwise alignments and TC score is the sum of scores of each column for a multiple alignment. The4.51e-5 and 0.0167 for SP and TC scores, respectively, with the alternative hypothesis that true difference in the means of Kalign2 and KalignP is less than 0. The paired t-test was performed by R. Here, KalignP were optimized on Balibase 3.0 using a 3-fold crossvalidation (see Supplementary Material). The largest improvement was made on RV50 (for proteins with insertions) where KalignP made a 2.0% improvement for SP score and 2.4% for TC score (see Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table S1</ref>). Only two methods in the benchmark outperformed KalignP, T_coffee (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Notredame et al., 2000</ref>) and Probcons (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Do et al., 2005</ref>) but these methods are much slower. Note that the speed of KalignP for alignment alone is comparable to Kalign2. However, including the time for secondary structure prediction and ESPSGP calculation it is slower but still comparable to<ref type="bibr">ClustalW and Muscle (Edgar, 2004</ref>). KalignP made a steady improvement on the alignment of TM proteins as well. As shown in the benchmark on ref7 (for TM proteins) of Balibase 3.0, KalignP outperformed Kalign2 by 1.6% for SP score and 1.8% for TC score (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>). However, the significance of the improvement as shown by the t-test is not strong (P-values are 0.0623 and 0.278 for SP and TC scores, respectively). This is most likely because the sample size is too small. The Balibase 3.0 ref7 contains only eight alignments and the results for KalignP were obtained by optimizing parameters on all these alignments. Therefore, over-training might be an issue here. To test the robustness of KalignP on the alignment of TM proteins, we created another reference dataset PfamA-mem which was derived from Pfam-A (version 24.0) seed alignments and filtered by matching the key word 'transmembrane' in the 'DE' record. The same parameters optimized from ref7 were used to test these 51 alignments in PfamA-mem (see Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S3</ref>for a list of these 51 Pfam-A alignments). A similar improvement of KalignP over Kalign2 was obtained (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>). The P-values for paired t-test are 2.75e-4 and 3.85e-3 for SP and TC scores, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>Here, we present KalignP, a method that allows externally supplied position specific gap penalty, and maintains the high speed and accuracy of Kalign2. Using gap-penalties from predicted secondary structures a steady improvement is seen. Further, KalignP is more flexible than Kalign2, as researchers can modify the behavior of alignment using other knowledge.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><figDesc>Funding: Swedish Research Council (VR-NT 2009-5072, VR-M 2007-3065); SSF (the Foundation for Strategic Research); the EU 7'th Framework Program by support to the EDICT project (contract No: FP7-HEALTH-F4-2007-201924).

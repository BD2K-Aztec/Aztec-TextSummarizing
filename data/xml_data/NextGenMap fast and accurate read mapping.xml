			<abstract>
				<p>When choosing a read mapper, one faces the trade off between speed and the ability to map reads in highly polymorphic regions. Here, we report NextGenMap, a fast and accurate read mapper, which reduces this dilemma. NextGenMap aligns reads reliably to a reference genome even when the sequence difference between target and reference genome is large, i.e. highly polymorphic genome. At the same time, NextGenMap outperforms current mapping methods with respect to runtime and to the number of correctly mapped reads.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>High-throughput sequencing technologies produce several million reads per run, with read lengths ranging from 36 to 41000 bp. The increasing read length and the advent of technologies like Ion Torrent and MiSeq drive the need for new efficient read mapping methods. In addition, the demand increases for methods that can cope with high sequence divergence and at the same time are user-friendly. Two main groups of read mapping programs are distinguished based on their indexing methods (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Nielsen et al., 2011</ref>). First, Burrows Wheeler transformation (BWT)-based methods, e.g. BWA (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Li and Durbin, 2009</ref>), which are fast but optimized for short reads and genomes with low polymorphism. Second, hashbased methods like Stampy (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Lunter and Goodson, 2011</ref>), which are slow but also suited for highly polymorphic genomes. Thus, a method that combines speed and accuracy provides a quantitative and qualitative improvement of current methods.</p><p>To this end, we introduce NextGenMap, a method that is faster than current BWT-based methods and at the same time handles short and long reads independent of the number of differences between reads and reference genomes. NextGenMap implements new techniques to efficiently identify genomic regions in the reference genome that share a sequence similarity with a read. To achieve a short runtime and to reliably map the reads, NextGenMap automatically estimates important parameters (like the number of alignment score computations required for each read). Additionally, NextGenMap makes use of multicore CPUs and, if available, any OpenCL-enabled graphic card (GPU). NextGenMap supports fasta, fastq, SAM and BAM as input formats; and outputs SAM and BAM files. Furthermore, NextGenMap maps single-end and paired-end data, offers a local (Smith Waterman) and an end-to-end alignment mode and supports aligning bisulfite-treated reads (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Dinh et al., 2012</ref>). The peak memory consumption of NextGenMap ranged from 5 to 6 GB, depending on the read length.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">METHODS</head><p>NextGenMap comprises three steps. First, it splits the reference genome into overlapping k-mers and stores the positions in a hash-table. Second, NextGenMap identifies the genomic regions, where a read potentially maps to. To this end, the k-mers from each read are extracted and putative genomic locations are retrieved from the hash-table. Only regions on the genome where the number of k-mer matches exceeds a certain threshold are considered as candidate mapping regions. Unlike other methods, NextGenMap automatically determines a read-specific threshold, rather than one threshold for all reads. Third, NextGenMap computes the alignment score for the candidate mapping regions. For the candidate region(s) with the highest alignment score, the full alignment is computed and reported. This final step is performed using an extended implementation of the MASon library (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Rescheneder et al., 2012</ref>). The Supplementary Section 1 provides a more detailed description on how NextGenMap aligns reads.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Benchmark data</head><p>To study NextGenMap's performance on re-sequencing projects, we used real datasets and simulated datasets (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S4</ref>). Three Illumina (R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 ), one Ion Torrent (R 4 ) and one 454 dataset (R 5 ) from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA-NCBI) served as benchmark data. To assess the mapping accuracy, we simulated four read sets using Mason (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Holtgrewe, 2010</ref>): S 1 (150 bp reads), S 2 (250 bp reads) derived from the human genome, S 3 (100 bp reads) from the Arabidopsis thaliana *To whom correspondence should be addressed. y The authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the first two authors should be regarded as joint First Authors. genome and S 4 (100 bp reads) from the Drosophila melanogaster genome. In all datasets, we introduced a 1.2% sequencing error and assumed a genomic polymorphism (SNPs, insertion and deletions) of 0.1% (S 1 , S 2 ) and 2% (S 3 , S 4 ). Finally, we simulated 11 datasets (A 0 ,. .. , A 10 ) based on the A.thaliana genome with an increasing degree of genomic polymorphisms (0–10%). Based on the article by<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Nielsen et al. (2011)</ref>, we compared NextGenMap with four popular mapping methods. Representatives of BWT-based methods were BWA (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Li and Durbin, 2009</ref>), its extension for longer reads BWA-SW (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Li and Durbin, 2010</ref>) and Bowtie2 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</ref>). As hash-based representative we selected Stampy (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Lunter and Goodson, 2011</ref>). Similar to<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Fonseca et al. (2012)</ref>, we executed all programs using default parameters. For further details, see Supplementary Sections 2 and 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>In terms of runtimes, NextGenMap outperformed all analyzed mappers (see Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S5a</ref>and S6a) on all real (R 1 ,. .. , R 5 ) and simulated datasets (S 1 ,. .. , S 4 ). NextGen Map's CPU implementation was 1.1–2.3 times faster than Bowtie2, the fastest method so far. The GPU implementation further reduces the runtime (1.6–4.9 times faster). If we compare the runtimes of the methods that showed the highest accuracy, NexGenMap is between 2.9 and 5.8 times faster than BWA-SW. Stampy, although very accurate for highly polymorphic genomes (2.0%), shows the longest runtimes (maximum 37 h) compared with NextGenMap (65 min for the same dataset). Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S6b</ref>displays the mapping accuracies for the simulated data. For low genomic polymorphism (0.1%), BWA-SW shows 0.1% and 0.2% more correctly mapped reads compared with NextGenMap for S 1 and S 2 , respectively. However, for genomic polymorphism of 2%, the hash-based mappers (NextGenMap, Stampy) are the best with a mapping accuracy of 97.6% and 85.5% for S 3 and S 4 , respectively. To further elucidate the influences of polymorphic genomes on the mapping accuracy, we varied the degree of genomic polymorphism from 0% to 10% for A.thaliana (A 0 ,. .. , A 10 ).<ref type="figure">Figure 1a</ref>displays the decline in mapping accuracy for BWTbased methods and also shows that accuracy is unaffected by degree of genomic polymorphism for the hash-based mappers (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S7</ref>). However, Stampy can only retain the accuracy with the expense of an increased computing time (<ref type="figure">Fig. 1b</ref>), whereas NextGenMap shows no substantial increase in runtime (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S8</ref>). In summary, NextGenMap maps reads very accurately and independent of the amount of genomic polymorphism (up to 10%). At the same time, NextGenMap exhibits the fastest runtime. We also note that graphic cards provide additional speedup. However, a strong effect is only observed when the number of alignment computations is high, as is the case for highly polymorphic genomes ( 8%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">CONCLUSION</head><p>Here, we showed with real and simulated data that NextGenMap maps high-throughput sequencing reads accurately and fast at the same time. This fact was already exploited in studies of miRNA (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Vesely et al., 2012</ref>) and bisulfite-treated data (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Dinh et al., 2012</ref>). Finally, the automatized estimation of the required number of alignment score computations per read and the automatic adaptation to the hardware result in a reliable and fast read mapper that requires minimal user interaction. This allows NextGenMap to reliably map reads even to highly polymorphic genomes (10%). Thus, it may also be used to map reads from nonstandard organism to a phylogenetically close reference genome or to apply it to metagenomics data.</p><formula>(a)</formula><p>divergence<ref type="bibr">[%]</ref>mapped<ref type="bibr">[</ref><ref type="figure">Fig. 1.</ref>(a) Percentage of correctly (solid) and incorrectly (dashed) mapped reads and (b) running times for different degree of genomic polymorphisms between read and reference genome for five million 100 bp A.thaliana reads (A 0 ,. .. , A 10 ).

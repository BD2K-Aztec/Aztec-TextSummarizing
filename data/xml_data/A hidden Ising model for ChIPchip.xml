				<p>Motivation: Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with tiling microarray (chip) experiments have been used in a wide range of biological studies such as identification of transcription factor binding sites and investigation of DNA methylation and histone modification. Hidden Markov models are widely used to model the spatial dependency of ChIP-chip data. However, parameter estimation for these models is typically either heuristic or suboptimal, leading to inconsistencies in their applications. To overcome this limitation and to develop an efficient software, we propose a hidden ferromagnetic Ising model for ChIP-chip data analysis. Results: We have developed a simple, but powerful Bayesian hierarchical model for ChIP-chip data via a hidden Ising model. Metropolis within Gibbs sampling algorithm is used to simulate from the posterior distribution of the model parameters. The proposed model naturally incorporates the spatial dependency of the data, and can be used to analyze data with various genomic resolutions and sample sizes. We illustrate the method using three publicly available datasets and various simulated datasets, and compare it with three closely related methods, namely TileMap HMM, tileHMM and BAC. We find that our method performs as well as TileMap HMM and BAC for the high-resolution data from Affymetrix platform, but significantly outperforms the other three methods for the low-resolution data from Agilent platform. Compared with the BAC method which also involves MCMC simulations, our method is computationally much more efficient. Availability: A software called iChip is freely available at</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Identification of the sites of interactions between proteins and genomic DNA is one of the most important topics in biological research. The emergence of high-density tiling microarrays has made it possible to create high-resolution global maps of the in vivo interactions between specific proteins and genomes. Tiling arrays use millions of short oligonucleotide probes with various resolutions to interrogate genomic regions of interest. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-chip analysis has become a powerful technique used to determine the binding sites of DNA-binding * To whom correspondence should be addressed.</p><p>proteins at a genome-wide basis (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cawley et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Boyer et al., 2005</ref>). It is a challenge to analyze ChIP-chip data, due to the huge amount of probes, the small number of replicates and various noises introduced in the experiments. The most important feature of ChIPchip data is the neighboring dependency of the probe intensities. Quite a few of existing methods in the literature make efforts to incorporate the dependence structure of ChIP-chip data into various statistical models. Sliding window methods may be the most straightforward ones. These methods are to test a hypothesis for each probe or region using the statistic that is built based on all the probes' information within a sliding window of certain genomic distance. The test statistics used are varied. For example,<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cawley et al. (2004)</ref>used Wilcoxon's rank sum statistics,<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Keles et al. (2006)</ref>used the moving average of classical t-statistics, Ji and<ref type="bibr">Wang (2005)</ref>used the moving average of empirical Bayesian t-statistics and<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Buck et al.(2005)</ref>used the moving average of log2 ratios. Since a huge number of tests are performed and the test statistics are not independent, these approaches leave with a difficult problem for multiple hypothesis testing adjustment. Two significant variants of the sliding window methods are the joint binding deconvolution (JBD;<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Qi et al., 2006</ref>) and the model-based deconvolution (with the software MeDiChI) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Reiss et al., 2008</ref>), which fit a local regression for each probe with the nearby probes within a sliding window used as explanatory variables, and the inference is made based on the fitted regression coefficients. Hidden Markov models (HMMs;<ref type="bibr">Ji and Wang, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Li et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Munch et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Humburg et al., 2008</ref>) are appealing approaches to model the dependency of ChIP-chip data. However, in most of the existing implementations of HMM methods, parameter estimation for the models is typically either ad hoc or suboptimal for ChIP-chip data. For example,<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Li et al. (2005)</ref>estimated the model parameters using the results from a previous Affymetrix SNP array experiments.<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Munch et al. (2006)</ref>estimated the model parameters using the Baum–Welch algorithm (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baum, 1972</ref>).<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Humburg et al. (2008)</ref>used the Baum–Welch algorithm (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rabiner, 1989</ref>) plus Viterbi training (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Juang and Rabiner, 1990</ref>) to estimate the model parameters. The major limitation of these algorithms, as pointed out by<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Humburg et al. (2008)</ref>, is that the Baum–Welch algorithm tends to converge to a local maximum of the likelihood function and the Viterbi training algorithm even fails to converge to a local maximum of the likelihood in some cases. Therefore, the parameter estimates and followed inference are often suboptimal to the problem. Markov random fields is a natural generation of Markov processes in which a space index is used to replace the time index. Markov random field models are appealing alternative approaches for ChIP-chip data because the spacial dependency can be naturally modeled.<ref type="bibr">[15:02 19/2/2010 Bioinformatics-btq032.tex]</ref>Page: 778 777–783</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Q.Mo and F.Liang</head><p>The Bayesian hierarchical model proposed by<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gottardo et al. (2008)</ref>modeled the probe intensities using a mixture of normal distributions, and the spatial dependency of the probes through a Markov random field prior, which is a Gaussian intrinsic autoregression model (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Besag and Kooperberg, 1995</ref>). The important feature of this model is that neighboring probes are encouraged to be in the same state (enriched or non-enriched), which is a typical characteristic of ChIP-chip data. The inference is based on the joint probability of neighboring probes, which in fact is an off-model remedy because the model itself is not able to completely simulate the spatial dependency of ChIP-chip data. A limitation of the model used by<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gottardo et al. (2008)</ref>is that it is very computationally intensive: for a dataset with 300 000 probes, it needs about 10 h for 15 000 iterations on a personal computer. We note that the locally self-clustering behavior of the ChIPchip data is extremely similar to the phenomenon observed in ferromagnetic materials, which has been extensively studied by physicists. In ferromagnetic materials, many electrons act cooperatively and spin in the same direction. The Ising model, named after the German physicist Ernst Ising, was designed to investigate whether local forces can cause a large number of the electrons to spin in the same direction. For further details of the Ising model, we refer the reader to<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kindermann and Snell (1980)</ref>. Here, we just briefly describe the concept. The 1D Ising model considers a sequence of points on a line. At each point, there is an atom of a magnetic material which at any given moments is in one of two states, 'up' and 'down'. If we think of each probe along the chromosomes is in one of two states, enriched or nonenriched, then the Ising model could be a good fit to ChIP-chip data. In this article, we propose to model ChIP-chip data through a hidden ferromagnetic Ising model. The rationale underlying this modeling will be explained further in later sections. Our method differs from the existing methods that also model the spacial dependency such as HMMs (<ref type="bibr">Ji and Wang, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Li et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Munch et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Humburg et al., 2008</ref>) and the Bayesian hierarchical model (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gottardo et al., 2008</ref>) in several respects. First, unlike the existing HMM methods, we model ChIP-chip data in a fully Bayesian framework and simulate the posterior distributions of the model parameters using the Metropolis within Gibbs sampler. Second, our method naturally takes into account the dependence structure of the data, does not need off-model remedy for inference and is computationally much more efficient as compared with the Bayesian hierarchical model (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gottardo et al., 2008</ref>). Third, our method makes little assumption about the size of IP-enriched regions, and it is able to detect IP-enriched regions with few to numerous probes. As a result, our method significantly outperforms the existing methods for the data with low-genomic resolutions. We will demonstrate these advantages of our method using three real and various simulated datasets. The remainder of this article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe our new Bayesian hierarchical model and its Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) implementation. In Section 3, we compare our method to three closely related methods, namely TileMap HMM (<ref type="bibr">Ji and Wang, 2005</ref>), tileHMM (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Humburg et al., 2008</ref>) and BAC (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gottardo et al., 2008</ref>) using three experimental datasets. In Section 4, we comparatively evaluate the performances of our method and the three alternative methods by a series of simulation studies. In Section 5, we conclude this article with a brief discussion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">THE MODEL</head><p>Let y = (y 1 ,...,y n ) be a realization of relative enrichment measurements Y = (Y 1 ,...,Y n ) on n probes along chromosomes. Here, the definition of Y i is flexible. It could be any appropriate measurement for comparison of treatment (IP-enriched) and control (non-enriched) samples. For example, y i could be a log 2 ratio of IP-enriched and control samples for an experiment with single replicate, or a summary statistic constructed at the probe level for an experiment with multiple replicates. The proposed method is designed to model the probe enrichment measurements, instead of the probe intensities, as the latter may have sequence-specific effects due to different binding affinities. A wisely designed statistic of enrichment measurement could remove the sequence-specific effects in preparation of the data y, for example, by subtracting the probe intensities of the control samples from that of the IPenriched samples. We let each probe associate with a binary latent variable X i ∈{−1,1}, where X i = 1 denotes that the probe belongs to a enriched region, and −1 a non-enriched region. We assume, conditioning on X i = x i , Y i follows a normal distribution</p><formula>y i | x i ∼ N(µ a ,σ 2 ) if x i =−1, N(µ b ,σ 2 ) if x i = 1.</formula><formula>(1)</formula><p>Furthermore, we assume, conditioning on X = (X 1 ,...,X n ), Y 1 ,...,Y n are independent.

Only when β&gt;0, the proposed model reflects the structure of ChIP-chip data. Therefore, we restrict β to be positive. A large positive value of β gives rise to large clusters of probes. Here, we only consider the interactions among the nearest neighbors. When the interaction is beyond the nearest neighbors, the model turns into a high-order Ising model, and Z(β) become intractable. For a high-order 1D Ising model, sampling from the posterior distribution of β is extremely difficult considering the huge number of probes that are needed to be processed. The rationale underlying the model (4) can be justified from the perspective of ChIP-chip experiments as follows. In ChIP-chip experiments, genomic DNA is sheared into fragments with various lengths, typically ranging from 200 to 1000 bp. The DNA fragments bound by binding proteinsPage: 779 777–783</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ChIP-chip data analysis</head><p>are enriched through immunoprecipitation (IP). After amplification and labeling, the IP-enriched DNA fragments are further chopped to smaller pieces for hybridizations. As a result of this process, all probes in the vicinity of the binding sites have chances to hybridize to the IP-enriched DNA fragments, resulting in consecutive probes with relatively high intensities. In contrast, if the DNA fragments do not contain binding sites, it is expected that the probe intensities in that genomic regions represented by consecutive probes are primarily composed of background intensities. Therefore, the probes along the chromosomes tend to form clusters, which are made of consecutive probes of the same state (enriched or non-enriched). The cluster sizes depend on the genomic resolution and the lengths of sheared DNA fragments. For example, for an array with 35 bp resolution, each IP-enriched region may consist of approximately 10–58 probes; and for an array with 280 bp resolution, each IP-enriched region may consist of approximately 1–7 probes. This locally self-clustering phenomenon of ChIP-chip data is extremely similar to the cooperative behavior of magnetic materials, which has been modeled by Ising models in physics. If we code the probes belonging to the enriched and non-enriched regions by 1 and −1, respectively, then the hidden state vector introduced in (1) can be viewed as a configuration of an Ising model and can thus be modeled by (4). We note that an analogy of our model in 2D space, where Y is observed on a rectangular lattice, has often been used in image analysis and segmentation (see, e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hurn et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ibanez and Simo, 2003</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">A comparative evaluation of the four methods</head><p>Both TileMap HMM (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Ji and Wong, 2005</ref>) and tileHMM (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Humburg et al., 2008</ref>) use a two-step approach for the data with multiple replicates. In the first step, probe-level statistics that measure the relative abundance of DNA fragments in the treatment and control experiments are calculated. In the second step, the regularized t-statistics are used to build a HMM, in which they are treated as the outcomes of enriched and non-enriched hidden states. Following these approaches, we also used a two-step approach for the data with multiple replicates. We first calculated a statistic for each probe and then modeled the statistics using the proposed method. Regarding the probe-level statistics, there are several choices available, for instance, the moderated t-statistic (<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Smyth, 2004</ref>), the empirical Bayes t-statistic (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Ji and Wong, 2005</ref>) and the shrinkage t-statistic (Opgen<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Rhein and Strimmer, 2007</ref>). All these statistics are constructed by borrowing information from all probes on the microarray to estimate individual variances, resulting in increased performance compared with the ordinary t-statistic. To compare the performances of the proposed method and the alternative methods, we used the same statistic for all the three methods. Here, we chose the moderated t-statistic, which has been implemented in the limma package in R (http://www.bioconductor.org/). For this reason, we will call the moderated t-statistic limma t-statistic. The limma t-statistic has a robust behavior and good performance even for small numbers of replicates (<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Smyth, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Opgen-Rhein and Strimmer, 2007</ref>). Therefore, we used this statistic as the enrichment measurement of DNA fragments. For comparison of our method and the three alternative methods, we first evaluated these methods using a high-genomic resolution dataset—the p53 chromosome 22 data, and then two low-genomic resolution datasets— the Nanog and Oct4 data. To use our method, we need to initialize two model parameters, the latent vector X and the interaction parameter β.For both parameters, prior information can be used to set the initial values. It is generally known that the enrichment measurement of an enriched probe is typically several standard deviations (SDs) higher than the mean value. Therefore, we set the initial sate of each probe to 1 if its limma t-statistic is &gt;2 SDs of the mean value and 0 otherwise. The parameter β plays an important role on the model (4). It affects the cluster number and size of the probes. A probe cluster is defined as consecutive probes in the same state (enriched or non-enriched). We can think of a genome that is partitioned into a series of segments, non-enriched and enriched regions, and each of the segments is a cluster. When β is small, the neighboring effect of probes is weak. As a result, the probes tend to form many small clusters. When β increases, the number of probe clusters decreases, and the cluster size increases. We set the initial value of β to 3.0 and updated β using the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm with a Gaussian random walk proposal with SD 0.01. The other parameters were updated using a cyclic Gibbs sampler. To apply TileMap HMM and BAC to ChIP-chip data, an important parameter to be determined in advance is the size of the sliding window. Both TileMap HMM and BAC have been used to analyze the p53 data, thus we just used the default parameters given by the authors. For the Agilent Oct4 and Nanog data, we followed the suggestions by the authors, adjusting the sliding window size according to the probe resolution and the average length of the sheared DNA fragments.<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Boyer et al. (2005)</ref>reported that the maximum sheared DNA fragment size was ∼550 bp, which suggests that the DNA fragments would approximately cover three to five probes, given that the probe resolution is ∼280 bp. In fact, we have tried different window sizes for the two methods and found the results were best when the size was set to this range. This is consistent with our estimation. The tileHMM method uses t emission distribution in the HMM, thus it needs to choose a degree of freedom for the t-distribution. We also tried different values in order to obtain the best results. Therefore, for the three alternative methods, we report the best results we could obtain. For our method, we let the Metropolis within Gibbs sampler run for 50 000 iterations (the first 10 000 used as burn-in<ref type="bibr">)</ref>for the p53 and Nanog data, and 70 000 iterations (the first 30 000 used as burn-in) for the Oct4 data.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>shows the histograms of the β samples generated from their posterior distributions. The means and standard errors (in the parentheses) of the β parameters are 3.55(0.026),2.58(0.013) and 2.96(0.024) for the p53, Nanog and Oct4 data, respectively. We compared our methods with the three alternative methods using the validated regions or high-confidence enriched regions as the gold standard. For the p53 chromosome 22 data, there were nine RT-PCR validated enriched regions. For the Nanog and Oct4 data, although there were not RT-PCR validated regions, the authors (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Boyer et al., 2005</ref>) reported 367 potentiallyenriched regions on 353 genes that were co-occupied by the three TFs, Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2. To detect enriched regions,<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Boyer et al. (2005)</ref>calculated a score for each probe using the so-called whole-chip error model. A single probe P-value (SPP) was then calculated for each score, and a probe set P-value (PSP) was calculated for the average score of each probe and its two immediate neighbors. A probe set is said to be enriched if its PSP &lt;0.001 and two of the SPPs&lt;0.005, or the center SPP&lt;0.001 and one of the flanking SPPs&lt;0.1. Although the false discovery rate (FDR) was not estimated for the 367 regions, they still should be a good standard for the comparison considering that these regions are detected by all the three experiments. To ease comparison, we selected fixed posterior probability and FDR cutoffs. The latter was calculated using a direct posterior probability approach as described in<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Newton et al. (2004)</ref>. Following the approach used by<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cawley et al. (2004)</ref>, we merged adjacent enriched probes separated by 500 bp or less into the same enriched region. The results are summarized in<ref type="figure">Table 1</ref>, where 'Ising' refers to our method. For the p53 data, at the posterior probability cutoff 0.9 and FDR cutoff 0.05, all the four methods detect the nine validated enriched regions. Although tileHMM detects all the nine validated regions, it essentially fails for the p53 data. For example, it detects 15 027 enriched regions, which are obviously dominated by false enriched regions. We further looked into the ranking performance of these validated regions. The nine validated regions on chromosome 22 are found by Ising, TileMap HMM and BAC in their top 60 regions. However, none is found by tileHMM, which further supports that most of the enriched regions detected by tileHMM are false positives. For the Oct4 and Nanog data, at the fixed posterior probability and FDR cutoffs, our approach detects much more gold regions and total enriched regions than TileMap HMM and BAC. BAC essentially fails for</p></div>

It is pretty clear that most of the enriched regions are not detected by TileMap HMM and BAC for the Oct4 and Nanog data. Although tileHMM detects more gold regions than our method, it achieves this at the expense of a lot of false positives. Therefore, based on these real examples, our approach seems to perform at least as well as the others for the high-resolution data, but significantly outperform the others for the low-resolution data. To get a better sense of the performance of these methods, it may be necessary to show the results in a typical genomic region.<ref type="figure">Figures 2 and 3</ref>show the posterior probabilities of probes in enriched state against the genomic positions for a small portion of the p53 and Oct4 data. In general, the posterior probabilities produced by TileMap HMM, BAC and our methods tend to be dichotomized, either close to 0 or 1. As expected, most of the posterior probabilities are close to 0, which corresponds to the non-enriched state. This indicates a clear classification of enriched and non-enriched probes. In contrast, the posterior probabilities generated by tileHMM are notdichotomized, indicating that it is not able to produce a clear classification of enriched and non-enriched probes. For the high-resolution p53 data, TileMap HMM, BAC and our method work well. The two confirmed enriched regions are successfully detected by all the three methods (<ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>). However, most of the posterior probabilities generated by tileHMM are close to 1, and this is obviously unrealistic (<ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>). For the low-resolution data, as shown in<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>, our method detects more potential enriched regions than TileMap HMM and BAC. TileHMM also fails for this data, because the posterior probabilities generated by that are not dichotomized and have too many high values in the non-enriched regions.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>shows the typical enriched regions detected by our method for the data with high-and low-genomic resolutions. Due to different genomic resolutions, the numbers of probes used to interrogate the enriched regions are much different. The enriched region for the p53 data in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>are composed of about 19 probes. In contrast, there are only 4–5 probes in the Nanog enriched region. Our method is able to detect enriched regions with few to numerous probes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">SIMULATION STUDIES</head><p>In order to have a thorough evaluation of the performance of the Ising model in comparison with the other three methods, we carried out a series of simulations. For a fair comparison, we tried to generate simulated data that reflect the underlying structure of ChIP-chip data, instead of generating particular data to satisfy each model. The probe enrichment measurements in a enriched region typically form a triangular or bell-shaped structure (e.g. see<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4</ref>), where the peak location is usually closest to the actual binding site. Following<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gottardo et al. (2008)</ref>, we used the function given by M exp(−4D 2 p /L 2 ) to model the probe intensities in the enriched regions, where M is the value of the peak, D p is the genomic distance between probe p and the peak and L is the length of the enriched region. To generate simulated data with high-and low-genomic resolutions, we used the first 40 000 genomic positions of the Affymetrix chromosome 22 and the Agilent chromosome 1 as the genomic coordinates, respectively. The binding site of a TF istypically about several base pairs, thus a probe can completely cover it. Therefore, it is appropriate to choose the genomic position of a probe as a peak position. To generate data for enriched regions, we randomly selected 40 genomic positions as the peak positions. The values for the peaks were randomly generated from a uniform distribution between 3 and 8, and the length of the enriched regions (parameter for L) were randomly generated from a uniform distribution between 400 bp and 1000 bp. The probes in a given enriched region were set to the values according to the function M exp(−4D 2 p /L 2 ) if the distances between the probes and the peak are ≤L/2 bp, and zero otherwise. In addition, we also added background noises to the probes in the enriched regions. Background noises were generated from the normal distributions with mean 0 and variances of 1, 2.25 and 4, respectively. For the probes in the nonenriched regions, their values were set to pure background noises. We simulated 60 high-resolution and 60 low-resolution datasets. Each dataset contained three replicates for both control and treatment conditions, and each replicate contained 40 000 probes. Among the 60 high-or low-resolution datasets, 20 were created using the background noise with a variance of 1, another 20 with a variance of 2.25 and the rest 20 with a variance of 4. In summary, we generated six different datasets corresponding to the six combinations: two different genomic coordinates × three different background noises. We evaluated the performance of the four methods by comparing the receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curves for each simulation scenario. The ROC curves show the average number of positive regions against the average number of false positive regions detected by each method when varying the posterior probability cutoff (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 5</ref>). For the simulated high-resolution data (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 5A</ref>, C and E), regardless the amount of noise added to the data, all the methods perform almost equally well. The area under ROC curve (AUC) is around 1 for each method. This indicates that all the four methods are quite robust to the noise. For the simulated low-resolution data (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 5B</ref>, D and F), our method performs the best when the level of noise is low (the variance of noise are equal to 1 or 2.25). When the variance of noise increases to 4, BAC performs the best, followed by TileMap HMM and our method. TileHMM performs the worst for the simulated low-resolution data with an extremely large false positive rate. This can be seen from<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5B</ref>, D and F, where the corresponding curves are almost flat and close to the horizontal axis. For the low-resolution data, the deteriorated performance of the these methods with increase of the background noise is quite understandable, because the enriched regions typically contain only a few probes, and are thus more easily affected by the noise.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">DISCUSSION</head><p>In this article, we have presented a simple, but powerful Bayesian hierarchical method to model ChIP-chip data through a hidden ferromagnetic Ising model. This approach naturally takes into account the intrinsic dependency of ChIP-chip data, and can be used to analyze data with various genomic resolutions and sample sizes. We comparatively evaluated our method and three closely related methods using three real and various simulated datasets. The results showed that our method performed as well as TileMap HMM and BAC in terms of sensitivity and specificity in detecting IPenriched regions for the high-resolution data. However, our method significantly outperformed the alternatives for the low-resolution data. The results showed that tileHMM did not work consistently. It essentially failed for the p53, Nanog and Oct4 data because it was not able to distinguish enriched and non-enriched probes (see<ref type="figure">Figs 2</ref>, 3 and<ref type="figure">Table 1</ref>). The regions detected by tileHMM are obviously dominated by false positives. However, it worked as well as the three alternative methods on the simulated highresolution data (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 5A</ref>, C and E). For the simulated low-resolution data, tileHMM had extremely high false positive rates at various posterior probability cutoffs (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 5B</ref>, D and F). Since all the four methods essentially make efforts to estimate the state (enriched or non-enriched) of each probe, ideally it is expected that probelevel posterior probabilities should be dichotomized, either close to 1 (for the enriched state) or 0 (for the non-enriched state), which can be used as a criterion for evaluating the performance of these methods. In terms of dichotomization, our method performed the best, followed by TileMap HMM and BAC, and tileHMM performed the worst. The three alternative methods used for comparison in this article are closely related to the Ising model we use. The Markov model is essentially a 1D Ising model (for details see<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kindermann and Snell, 1980</ref>). Vice versa, the model we proposed can also be treated as a HMM in which the transition matrix is determined by the interaction parameter β, and the emission probabilities are determined by the Equation (9). In addition, the Gaussian intrinsic auto-regression model used by<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gottardo et al. (2008)</ref>can also be viewed as a continuous extension of the Ising model. Since all the four methods basically use the same idea to model ChIP-chip data, why does our method outperform the others for the low-resolution data? This could be owed to the way we model the data and the algorithm used for parameter estimation. In our method, Metropolis within Gibbs sampling algorithm is used to estimate the model parameters, which is known to converge to their target distributions when the number of iterations becomes large.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ChIP-chip data analysis</head><p>Our method allows for a more precise estimation of the model parameters, which in turn, leads to an improvement in detecting IPenriched regions. In contrast, tileHMM is a non-Bayesian method, where the parameters are estimated using the Baum–Welch and/or Viterbi training algorithm. It is known that the Baum–Welch algorithm tends to converge to a local maximum of the likelihood function, and the Viterbi training algorithm may not even converge to the local maximum. The inconsistent performance of tileHMM on the real and simulated data indicates that the inferiority of tileHMM is mainly due to its training algorithm. In TileMap HMM, the model parameter estimation is typically ad hoc. It assigns a fixed value to the transition probability from an enriched probe i to a non-enriched probe i+1 if the two adjacent probes are in a predefined window with certain genomic distance. For example, for the array with 35 bp resolution and average DNA fragments ∼1000 bp, TileMap HMM sets the transition probability to 1/28 because it assumes that typical IP-enriched regions contain about 28 probes and 1/28 matches the mean length of a segment in an enriched region. In addition, TileMap HMM tends to be conservative in detecting IPenriched regions. BAC models the spatial dependency of probes via a Gaussian intrinsic auto-regression model, as aforementioned, which can be viewed as a continuous extension of the Ising model. To further make use of information of neighboring probes,<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gottardo et al. (2008)</ref>included in BAC an extra step to estimate the joint posterior probability of the probes in a sliding window. However, as demonstrated by our numerical examples, this off-model remedy is not very effective, especially for the low-resolution data. In addition, BAC directly models the probe intensity using a mixed-effect model. It assumes that each probe has a probe-specific background intensity, enrichment effect and random error. As a result, there are a huge number of parameters needed to be estimated, which not only significantly increases the computational burden but also makes the model potentially over-fitted, especially when the number of replicates is small. In summary, we have proposed a hidden ferromagnetic Ising model for ChIP-chip data analysis. The proposed method models the data in a fully Bayesian framework, which enables the model parameters to be estimated in a precise way. This overcomes the difficulty in parameter estimation for the existing HMM methods, leading to a significant improvement in detecting IP-enriched regions, especially for the low-resolution data. In contrast, the parameter estimation in most of the existing HMM methods, is typically either ad hoc or suboptimal. BAC also models the ChIPchip data in a fully Bayesian framework. Compared with BAC, our model is much simpler and the computational burden is significantly reduced. For example, for a dataset with 500 000 probes, to run 15 000 iterations on a 64-bit Linux machine with 2.4 GHz CPU, our method needed ∼15 min, but BAC needed ∼20 h. In addition, our method makes little assumptions about the size of the IP-enriched regions, and it can be used for the data with various levels of genomic resolution. Finally, we would like to point out that, with minor modifications, the proposed method may be applicable to other spatially correlated data such as ChIP-seq data (see, e.g. Park, 2009 for a review). To accommodate the discreteness of ChIP-seq data, a Poisson-like model can be used for the summary measurement Y.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><figDesc>[15:02 19/2/2010 Bioinformatics-btq032.tex]</figDesc></figure>

The Ising, TileMap HMM and BAC detect all the nine validated (V) regions for the 
p53 data at fixed posterior probability and FDR cutoffs; tileHMM essentially fails for 
the p53 data. For the Oct4 and Nanog data, the Ising method detects much more gold 
(G) regions and total enriched regions than TileMap HMM and BAC; tileHMM detects 
more gold regions than Ising at the expense of big false positives.

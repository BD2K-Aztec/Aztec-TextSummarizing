				<p>Non-linear calibration is a widely used method for quantifying biomarkers wherein concentration-response curves estimated using samples of known concentrations are used to predict the bio-marker concentrations in the samples of interest. The R package nCal fills an important gap in the open source, stand-alone software for performing non-linear calibration. For curve fitting, nCal provides a new implementation of a robust, Bayesian hierarchical five-parameter logistic model. nCal supports a simple graphical user interface that can be used by laboratory scientists, and contains functionality for importing data from the multiplex bead array assay instrumentation. Availability: The R package &apos;nCal&apos; is available from http://cran.r-pro ject.org/web/packages/nCal/ under GPL-2 or later. Contact: yfong@fhcrc.org Supplementary information: Supplementary information is available in the form of an R package vignette at the above repository and an FAQ at http://research.fhcrc.org/youyifong/en/resources/ncal.html.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Non-linear calibration is a widely used method for quantifying biomarkers in biomedical studies. There are two stages in nonlinear calibration. In the first stage, a concentration-response curve is estimated for each assay run using observed outcome for standard samples with known concentrations. An assay run refers to a batch of samples run closely in time and space, e.g. all samples run on a single microplate. In the second stage, point estimates and confidence bounds are estimated for the biomarker concentrations in the samples of interest. Many laboratories use commercial software for performing non-linear calibration. These include general purpose programs like GraphPad Prism and StatLIA, as well as assay-specific programs like MasterPlex and Bio-Plex Manager for the multiplex bead array assay, which is becoming a common assay for quantifying protein concentrations. Besides being expensive and hard to automate, these programs provide relatively simple singlecurve fitting methods. Furthermore, they often lack proper precision estimates for the estimated concentrations. The R package nCal provides two sets of curve-fitting methods. The first, implemented through another R package drc (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ritz and Streibig, 2005</ref>), is an estimating equation-based method that is equivalent to those available from most existing non-linear calibration software. The second, implemented within nCal, is a robust Bayesian random effects model-based approach (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Fong et al., 2012</ref>). It allows borrowing of information across multiple assay runs for the same biomarker, incorporates prior information regarding the curve-to-curve variability and provides flexible models for the experimental noise. After obtaining a curve fit via either approach, nCal estimates the biomarker concentrations in the samples of interest and computes variance estimates for the estimated concentrations. nCal does not have as extensive a graphical user interface as its commercial counterparts do, but it does contain a simple graphical user interface based on the R package gWidgets that allows non-R users to perform non-linear calibration. nCal also provides a function that imports data from the Excel files of Luminex Õ results that have been output by a Bio-Plex instrument's software.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">METHODS</head><p>Sigmoid-shaped concentration-response curves can be approximated well by five-parameter logistic (5PL) curves. Let Y ik denote the experimental outcome, where i indexes assay runs and k indexes standard samples. Let f 5PL Á; i ð Þ denote the 5PL function with parameter i. Estimating equation-based methods solve the following optimization problem for each assay run:</p><formula>^ ¼ argmin i X k g Y ik À f 5PL t k ; i ð Þ È É ,</formula><p>where g is a penalty function. For least square method, g x ð Þ ¼ x 2 ; for robust method, g x ð Þ can be x j j, a trim function or a winsorization function (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ritz and Streibig, 2005</ref>).

The experimental noise " ik can be modeled as having a normal distribution; for robust methods, it can be modeled as having a Student's t-distribution, a mixture of two normal distributions or a latent first-order autoregressive process (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Fong et al., 2012</ref>). We assume weakly informative priors on 0 and the parameters of the noise distribution, and substantive priors on (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Fong et al., 2012</ref>). The hyperparameters are listed in the Supplementary Information. Posterior samples are drawn using Just Another Gibbs Sampler (JAGS) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Plummer, 2003</ref>). We take the median of the posterior samples of i to be its point estimate, and the median of the posterior samples of f À1 5PL y; i ð Þto be the estimated concentration for a sample with observation y. As in<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Davidian and Giltinan (1995)</ref>, the variance of the estimated concentration can be decomposed into two components. The first component assumes that the concentration-response curve is perfectly known and the variability comes from the variability of y. It can be estimated as ^ 2 @f À1 5PL y; ^ i =@y n o 2 for both sets of curve fitting *To whom correspondence should be addressed. ß The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press.

The second component assumes that y is perfectly measured and the variability comes from the variability of the curve estimate.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">EXAMPLE SESSIONS</head><p>We illustrate the use of nCal through two examples (see Supplementary Information for the complete R code and more detailed explanation of the output).

From the two figures, we see that both curve fitting methods lead to similar calibration results for this example.

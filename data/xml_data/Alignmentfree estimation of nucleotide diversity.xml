				<p>Motivation: Sequencing capacity is currently growing more rapidly than CPU speed, leading to an analysis bottleneck in many genome projects. Alignment-free sequence analysis methods tend to be more efficient than their alignment-based counterparts. They may, therefore, be important in the long run for keeping sequence analysis abreast with sequencing. Results: We derive and implement an alignment-free estimator of the number of pairwise mismatches, π m. Our implementation of π m , pim, is based on an enhanced suffix array and inherits the superior time and memory efficiency of this data structure. Simulations demonstrate that π m is accurate if mutations are distributed randomly along the chromosome. While real data often deviates from this ideal, π m remains useful for identifying regions of low genetic diversity using a sliding window approach. We demonstrate this by applying it to the complete genomes of 37 strains of Drosophila melanogaster, and to the genomes of two closely related Drosophila species, D.simulans and D.sechellia. In both cases, we detect the diversity minimum and discuss its biological implications. Availability: pim is written in standard C and its sources can be downloaded from</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The study of sequence diversity within natural populations provides a powerful link between raw sequence data and functional knowledge. Such population genetic studies have traditionally been centered on a few transcribed loci. However, the exponential decay of sequencing costs over the past two decades has recently made it possible to carry out population genetics on a genome scale. In a comprehensive early example of such studies,<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Begun et al. (2007)</ref>surveyed the resequenced genomes of six Drosophila simulans lines with the closely related D.yakuba serving as outgroup. They described the large-scale patterns of within population diversity and between species divergence along the three major D.simulans chromosomes. While diversity declined toward the telomeres and centromeres, where recombination rates are low, divergence, and thus mutation rates, remained constant across the chromosomes, which is a classical hallmark of selection at linked sites (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Begun and Aquadro, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Charlesworth et al., 1993</ref>). * To whom correspondence should be addressed.</p><p>Similar genome-wide studies of population genetic processes are poised to become the norm. There are currently several projects under way aimed at sampling 1000 genomes of single model species. This shift to genome-scale sequence comparison has sparked interest in new population-centered sequence analysis methods. These fall into two categories: alignment-based and alignment-free. As to alignment-based methods, a number of recent studies have focused on the problem of estimating population mutation and recombination rates from aligned shotgun reads (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Haubold et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hellmann et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Jiang et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Johnson and Slatkin, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lynch, 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lynch, , 2009</ref>). The main challenge in this work is to account for variable coverage and the errors introduced by the diverse chemistries of next-generation sequencing approaches. In contrast, alignment-free methods of sequence comparison usually start from finished genomes or contigs. Given two homologous sequences, the most popular approaches are based on one of two kinds of measurements: the correlation between the frequencies of short 'words' such as 5mers found in each sequence (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chapus et al., 2005</ref>), and the lengths of matches between sequences (<ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Ulitsky et al., 2006</ref>). In Bioinformatics, such methods have a long tradition due to their superior computational efficiency when compared with sequence alignment (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ferragina et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Martinez, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Vinga and Almeida, 2003</ref>). However, until recently a disadvantage of alignment-free sequence comparison was that word frequencies or match lengths could not be transformed into mutation rates. In order to combine the computational efficiency of alignmentfree sequence comparison with the biological relevance of alignment-based divergence estimation,<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Haubold et al. (2009)</ref>have derived and implemented a moment-based estimator of the substitution rate from match lengths. This estimator can be used to rapidly compute meaningful phylogenies from closely related genomes ranging in size from 10 4 to 10 8 bases (Domazet<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Lošo and Haubold, 2009</ref>). Here, we extend this work by deriving a maximum likelihood estimator of pairwise nucleotide diversity that can be computed without alignment. We explore the accuracy of this estimator using simulations. In addition, we survey the genetic diversity along the chromosomes of 37 strains of D.melanogaster and the genome-wide divergence between D.simulans and D.sechellia.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Derivation of estimator ( π m ) without recombination</head><p>Our estimator of nucleotide diversity, π m , is based on the distribution of the lengths of exact matches between a pair of DNA sequences.

For each suffix in the query, we look up the length of the shortest prefix that is absent from the subject.<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Haubold et al. (2005)</ref>designated these absent prefixes SHortest Unique subSTRINGS (shustrings) and showed how to look them up efficiently using an enhanced suffix array (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abouelhoda et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Domazet-Lošo and Haubold, 2009</ref>). In our analysis, we assume that the shustring in the query is homologous to the corresponding substring in the subject. Note that we do not need to know the position of the homologous substring. To express diversity as a function of shustring lengths, let π be the number of mismatches per site between a pair of sequences. Under the infinite sites model, where each mutation affects a hitherto unchanged site, π is a proxy for the rate of mutation per site. In the absence of recombination, the probability of observing a shustring of length X = x is therefore the probability of observing a mutation terminating a shustring preceded by x −1 constant positions :</p><formula>P{X = x} = π(1−π) x−1</formula><p>≈ πe −π(x−1) .</p><formula>(1)</formula><p>We generalize this to calculate the probability of the shustring lengths found at every position in a query,</p><formula>P{X i = x i ∀i}≈ i πe −π(x i −1) ,</formula><formula>(2)</formula><p>where we ignore dependencies between shustrings at different positions, and where X i is the (random) shustring length at position i. Equivalently, log(P{X i = x i ∀i}) ≈ i logπ −π(x i −1).</p><formula>(3)</formula><p>To find the value of π that maximizes this expression, we differentiate with respect to π</p><formula>0 = ∂ ∂π i logπ −π(x i −1) = i 1 π −(x i −1),</formula><formula>(4)</formula><p>which leads to our maximum likelihood estimator of π,</p><formula>π m = |Q| i X i −1 ,</formula><formula>(5)</formula><p>where |Q| is the length of the query sequence. Notice that π m is approximately the inverse of the average shustring length. As a consequence of the ergodic theorem [e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Durrett (2010)</ref>, Section 6], π m ≈ π for large |Q|.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">π m with rcombination</head><p>Here, we derive the basic property that π m is downwardly biased in the presence of recombination. For this, we use the approximation that the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are generated by a Poisson point process in the absence of recombination and tend to cluster in the presence of recombination.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>shows 100 SNPs distributed along a single pair of sequences of arbitrary length simulated with or without recombination. In the absence of recombination, the time to the most recent common ancestor is constant along the sequences and hence the SNPs are distributed according to a constant rate Poisson process (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1A</ref>). In contrast, with a rate of recombination that is similar to the mutation rate, which is the case in most eukaryotes, the time B Ato the most recent common ancestor varies widely along the sequence (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1B</ref>). As a consequence, young, long segments contain fewer SNPs than old segments, which have had more time to both mutate and recombine, and SNPs cluster along the sequence (<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Wiuf and Hein, 1999</ref>). For our exploration of the mathematical properties of π m with recombination, we assume that the SNPs arise at (random) positions</p><formula>Z 0 &lt; Z 1 &lt; .... Clearly, if Z k &lt; i &lt; Z k+1</formula><p>, we find X i = Z k+1 −i+1. We denote by W = Z i+1 −Z i the waiting time between two SNPs (which by homogeneity does not depend on i). Any random site in the DNA is located between two SNPs separated by some distance W. The distribution of W is given by the size-biased distribution of W , since there is a higher chance to pick a site between two distant SNPs [see e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kallenberg (1984)</ref>]:</p><formula>P[ W = w]= wP[W = w] E[W ] .</formula><p>Moreover, given W , X is uniformly distributed between 1 and W. Therefore,</p><formula>E[X]=E[E[X| W ]] = E W 2 = ∞ w=1 w 2 P[W = w] 2E[W ] = E[W 2 ] 2E[W ] .</formula><p>Assume</p></div>

Moreover, it shows that the size of the bias is determined by the deviation of V<ref type="bibr">[W ]</ref>from 1/π 2. However, the function that relates V<ref type="bibr">[W ]</ref>to the rate of recombination is unknown.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Algorithm and implementation</head><p>We have implemented the computation of π m based on a publicly available software library for text indexing (<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Manzini and Ferragina, 2002</ref>). The resulting program, pim, can compute π m for two closely related, unaligned DNA sequences in FASTA format. In addition, it efficiently carries out the sliding window analyses described in the Section 3. The software is written in standard C, runs on the UNIX command line and its documented source code is freely available from http://guanine.evolbio.mpg.de/pim/</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Raw data and data analysis</head><p>At the time of our analysis, the Drosophila Population Genomics Project had released version 1.0 of its dataset. This contained the following 37 strains collected in Raleigh, NC, USA: RAL-301_1, RAL-303_1, RAL-304_1, RAL-306_1, RAL-307_2, RAL-313_1, RAL-315_1, RAL-324_1, RAL-335_2, RAL-357_1, RAL-358_1, RAL-360_1, RAL-3 62_2, RAL-365_1, RAL-375_1, RAL-379_1, RAL-380_2, RAL-391_2, RAL-399_1, RAL-427_1, RAL-437_1, RAL-486_1, RAL-514_1, RAL-517_1, RAL-555_1 , RAL-639_1, RAL-705_1, RAL-707, RAL-714_1, RAL-730_1, RAL-732_1, RAL-765_1, RAL-774_1, RAL-786_1, RAL-799_1, RAL-820_1, RAL-852_1. We downloaded the corresponding aligned sequence data from http://www.dpgp.org.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RESULTS</head><p>In the following sections, we apply π m to simulated data with and without recombination and to two empirical datasets: 37 genomes of D.melanogaster and the genomes of the two closely related Drosophila species D.simulans and D.sechellia.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Simulations</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Without recombination</head><p>We started our exploration of the properties of π m by simulating pairs of 500 kb sequences with a fixed number of mismatches.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>shows that when the mutation rate is close to the inverse of the sequence length, π m overestimates π, while for mutation rates &gt;0.03 it underestimates π. However, for population genetically relevant intermediate values of π, the theory closely approximates the simulations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">With recombination</head><p>The population recombination rate is expressed as ρ = 2N e c, where N e is the effective number of chromosomes in the population and c is the probability of a recombination affecting a given stretch of sequence per generation. As explained in Section 2, π m is based on the distances between pairs of mutations. Recombination causes these distances to deviate from uniformity (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>), which makes π m sensitive to recombination. In agreement with these theoretical considerations,<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>shows that even low rates of reciprocal recombination lead to strong underestimation of π due to an 'excess' of long, young tracts of low diversity. This means that π m in its current form is not generally suitable as a global measure of the number of pairwise mismatches. However, as we demonstrate in the next paragraph, it is still useful as an indicator of local fluctuations in π.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3">Sliding window analysis</head><p>We began our study of the local properties of π m with a sliding window analysis of one pair of 500 kb sequences without recombination. In<ref type="figure">Figure 4A</ref>, the average value of π m is 1.007 × 10 −2 , which is close to the average value of π, 1.001 × 10 −2. In addition, π m closely tracks the true diversity (Pearson's correlation r = 0.76; root mean square error, Page: 452 449–455</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Genetic diversity in a sample of D.melanogaster</head><p>We carried out a sliding window analysis of π m along the five chromosomal arms of the 37 D.melanogaster strains contained in the sample from Raleigh, NC, USA. It is important to realize that in an alignment-free sliding window analysis sequence coordinates can only refer to a single query sequence. As a result, of the 37 2 possible pairwise comparisons only 36 comparisons between an anchor sequence and the other members of the sample can be carried out. We arbitrarily used the first sequence in the dataset, RAL-301_1, as this anchor query, but apart from numerical detail our results are unaffected by the choice of anchor sequence [see (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Haubold et al., 2009</ref>) for a more thorough discussion of shustring-based metrics].<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>shows the distribution of the π m values compared with the corresponding π values computed from the aligned original dataset. As expected from<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>, the two distributions clearly differ with π m having a mean±SD of 0.0041±0.0001 and π a mean of 0.0056±0.0017. However, the tails of the two distributions are remarkably similar with almost identical ranges (0.00085 ≤ π m ≤ 0.001,0.00097 ≤ π ≤ 0.001). In our subsequent analysis, we concentrated on the lower tail of the distribution and located the global minimum of π m at the telomeric tip of chromosome 3L (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 6A</ref>).<ref type="figure">Figure</ref>diversity minimum with π m = 7.8×10 −4 centered on nucleotide 199 799. Significantly, the lowest of the corresponding π values was exactly centered on the homologous region located using π m. We analyzed 5 kb around this point from all 37 strains and identified 37 segregating sites in the region. Of these, 31 were singletons. Since a completed selection event (selective sweep) is characterized by an excess of singletons, we quantified the deviation from neutrality by computing a statistic commonly used to test the null hypothesis of neutral evolution called Tajima's D, D T (<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Tajima, 1989</ref>). It is proportional to the difference between the average number of pairwise differences and the normalized number of SNPs in a sample of DNA sequences. Under neutrality, these two quantities are equal and hence the neutral expectation of D T is zero, while after a complete selective sweep D T is expected to be transiently negative.In our case, D T is significantly negative (D T =−2.54;P = 0.00013). Since 9 of the 31 singletons were due to strain RAL-427_1, we recalculated D T in its absence and found a still significant value of D T =−2.42 (P = 0.00045). The D.melanogaster genome sample is released in aligned form. This allowed us to check the accuracy of π m by comparison to its alignment-based analogue, π. However, it does does not make a compelling case for alignment-free analysis and we therefore go on to demonstrate bona fide alignment-free genome comparison in the next section.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Comparison between D.simulans and D.sechellia</head><p>Drosophila simulans has diverged from D.sechellia for only approximately 1 million years (<ref type="bibr">Drosophila 12 Genomes Consortium, 2007</ref>). In the Comparative Assembly Freeze 1 of the 12 Drosophila genome sequencing project, the genome of D.simulans was released in fully assembled form while the genome of D.sechellia consisted of 14 730 contigs. The combined size of these two datasets was 308 982 892 bp. We analyzed these data with D.simulans serving as query in a 150 kb sliding window analysis of divergence from D.sechellia. This took 22 min and 44 s on an AMD Opteron 2.3 GHz processor. In order to compare this to the time requirement of the equivalent alignment-based analysis, we aligned these two genomes using the fast genome aligner MUMmer (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kurtz et al., 2004</ref>) on the same machine, which took 1 h, 32 min, 42 s. Again, we focus our analysis of the sliding window scan on regions of exceptional similarity between the two genomes and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7A</ref>shows the sliding window analysis for chromosome 2L, which contains the global minimum of π m at position 13 965 000. In contrast to the diversity minimum (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 6A</ref>), the divergence minimum is far from either the centromere or the telomere. In<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7B</ref>, we zoom into this region and show in addition to the 150 kb sliding windows 10 kb sliding windows, which reveal a number of conserved regions. The most highly conserved of these regions intersects with the protein-coding gene pickpocket (ppk), A Bwhich is involved in larval locomotion and development (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ainsley et al., 2008</ref>). To investigate whether the D.sechellia 12 genomes ppk reference allele is typical for D.sechellia, we compared it to the allele from an unrelated D.sechellia line (SynA, provided by E. Earley and C. Jones). The nucleotide divergence between the two D.sechellia lines is 6.4×10 −3 (14 unambiguous SNPs in a 2198 bp alignment), which is higher than expected for D.sechellia in general (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Legrand et al., 2009</ref>), but is still much lower than typical of divergence between D.sechellia and D.simulans (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 7</ref>). This confirms that there is no reason to suspect that the ppk allele we identified in the D.sechellia reference genome is the result of an assembly error.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DISCUSSION</head><p>Much has recently been written about the impressive speed of next-generation sequencing equipment (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Shendure and Ji, 2008</ref>), which is driving the current generalization of population genetics to population genomics (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Begun et al., 2007</ref>). However, technology change in sequence analysis algorithms has been equally remarkable. A substantial portion of these advances is based on the progressive abstraction of suffix trees (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gusfield, 1997</ref>) to enhanced suffix arrays (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abouelhoda et al., 2002</ref>) and, more recently, to highly memory efficient FM indexes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ferragina et al., 2008</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A</head><p>BHere we point out that the distances between SNPs can quickly be looked up using suffix tree and that these distances are connected to the number of mismatches by Equation (1). This suggests our new estimator of pairwise genetic diversity, π m , given in Equation (5). Our implementation of this estimator is based on an enhanced suffix array. The efficiency of the resulting software is best judged by comparing it to an alignment tool that uses the same data structure, such as MUMmer (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kurtz et al., 2004</ref>). As we report in the Section 3, pim is four times faster than MUMmer when applied to the genomes of D.sechellia and D.simulans. This comparison ignores that the MUMmer result would still need to be processed to yield the desired diversity values. It should also be borne in mind that alignmentfree approaches are bound to outperform alignment-based methods as the latter need to carry out far more steps than the former. The important question about an alignment-free estimator such as π m is therefore how useful it is for quantifying genetic diversity in real genomes. We show through simulations that for mutation rates greater than the inverse of the sequence length and less than 0.03, our estimator is very precise (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref>). This is the range of mutation rates relevant for analyzing genomes sampled from populations or closely related species. Recombination causes fluctuations in the time to the most recent common ancestor along a chromosome, which results in clustering of mutations (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>). As a consequence, the aggregate shustring length increases, which leads to an underestimation of π in the presence of even low levels of recombination (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>) and for biologically relevant recombination rates (ρ ≈ π), the effect on π m is rather strong. While this makes π m unsuitable for the estimation of global π in recombining genomes, our sliding window analyses of simulated sequences demonstrate that π m accurately tracks local fluctuations in nucleotide diversity (<ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>) and is reasonably robust to the choice of window length (Figs 6B and 7B; see also Supplementary Material). We have compared the results of our alignment-free estimator to the corresponding alignment-based measure wherever possible. The sequences published by the Drosophila Population Genomics Project allowed this comparison to be made for a substantial empirical dataset, as the newly released genomes are distributed aligned with respect to the reference genome. Such a comparison comfirms that π m tends on average to underestimate π, while preserving the range of true diversity values (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5</ref>). However, there is a reassuring correspondence between the empirical distributions of π and π m (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5</ref>) and the simulation with recombination (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>): we surmise that the regions where π m ≈ π are those of exceptionally low recombination, like the subtelomeres, and those of exceptionally high recombination. In between these two extremes, π m is less than π and in Section 2.2 we show that the difference between π and π m is determined by the degree to which the variance in inter-SNP distance (V<ref type="bibr">[W ]</ref>) exceeds its theoretical minimum of 1/π 2. In agreement with this interpretation of our statistic, we correctly identified the global diversity minimum at the telomeric tip of chromosome 3L (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 6A</ref>). This region is also known to have reduced genetic diversity and recombination in D.simulans (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Begun et al., 2007</ref>). The region of lowest diversity intersects the gene Enhancer of bithorax, E(bx) (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 6B</ref>). Not only is this gene among the most monomorphic in the genome, it also contains a significant excess of rare mutations, as expressed by the highly significant rejection of the standard neutral model (P = 0.00013). Our interspecific genome comparison identified a highly conserved gene (ppk), which may be closely tied to a behavioral peculiarity of D.sechellia: on its native islands, the Sychelles, it feeds on the toxic fruit of the non-native Indian mulberry (Morinda citrifolia), while its sister species D.simulans and most other fruit files avoid this plant (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dworkin and Jones, 2009</ref>). It is therefore likely that D.sechellia has recently undergone a shift in its breeding environment (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lemeunier and Ashburner, 1984</ref>). This biological background makes it intriguing that the region that is most similar between D.sechellia and D.simulans, and is thus a candidate for recent introgression, contains a gene that affects larval foraging behavior. Population genomics projects tend to be based on a well-curated reference genome that serves as the subject sequence to which new reads are aligned. This is certainly the approach of the Drosophila Population Genomics Project. Given such data, there might appear to be no case for alignment-free methods when dealing with samples of genomes drawn from closely related individuals. However, resequencing is often only a first step on the way toward full de novo assembly. Moreover, our divergence scan of D.simulans versus D.sechellia shows that unaligned genomes from closely related species can be compared efficiently and used to rapidly identify diversity outliers for further investigation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">BACKGROUND</head><p>The discovery of phosphorylation motifs helps to understand the underlying regulation mechanism and to facilitate the prediction of unknown phosphorylation sites. Several methods have been proposed to detect phosphorylation motifs from phosphoproteomics datasets. A recent article (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Wang et al. 2012</ref>) published in Bioinformatics developed a new method MMFPh (Maximal Motif Finder for Phosphoproteomics Datasets), which aims at identifying all statistically significant motifs and returns the maximal ones (those not subsumed by motifs with more fixed amino acids). The empirical comparison with Motif-X (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Schwartz and Gygi, 2005</ref>) and Motif-All (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">He et al. 2011)</ref>showed that MMFPh is able to find more important motifs than Motif-X and return less false positives than Motif-All. Both Motif-All and MMFPh claimed that they can identify all statistically significant motifs. However, the lack of a precise problem definition and the 'completeness' definition may bring some confusions for users to select the appropriate method for their tasks. In this letter, we like to clarify the difference of these two methods and show that MMFPh cannot find all (maximal) statistically significant motifs even with respect to their own completeness definition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">PROBLEM DEFINITION</head><p>Fundamental to any algorithmic problem, the first step is to provide a precise problem definition with clearly stated input and output.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">P1: significant and frequent motif discovery</head><p>The problem P1 is defined and investigated in Motif-All, with the following input and output. @BULLET Input: a set of phosphorylated peptides F (foreground data), a set of unphosphorylated peptides B (background data), the significance threshold θ sig and the support threshold θ sup. Suppose we use sig(m) to denote the statistical significance evaluation function and use sup(m) to denote the support calculation function for each motif m.In the input of problem P1, it is assumed that sig(m) returns a probability value like p-value for each motif m: the smaller sig(m) is, the more significant the motif m is. Intuitively, sig(m) measures the over-expressiveness of m in F against B. For instance, the binomial probability model is used in MMFPh for this purpose. The support for a motif m is defined as the percentage of phosphorylated peptides that can match this motif, i.e. sup(m) = occ(m)/|F|, where occ(m) is the number of peptides from F that match m and |F| denotes the size of the set F. Now we prove the following lemma: Lemma 1: Motif-All is complete for the P1 problem formulation. In other words, this algorithm finds all motifs that have support values larger than or equal to θ sup and significance values smaller than or equal to θ sig. Proof : the completeness of Motif-All can be shown by the following two facts. The first is that the Apriori algorithm (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agrawal and Srikant 1994</ref>) is complete; that is, all frequent motifs are enumerated in the 1st step of Motif-All. The second fact is that the 2nd step of Motif-all only prunes motifs whose significance values are larger than θ sig. In contrast, the MMFPh algorithm is unable to achieve such a completeness property for problem P1. Suppose m is a motif that has k fixed positions. We use m 1 (−1) , m 2 (−1) ,..., and m k (−1) to denote the motifs that are subsumed by m, and each of them has exactly k −1 fixed positions. That is, the only difference between m and m i (−1) is that the i-th fixed position in m is non-fixed in m i (−1). If all m i (−1) s are not significant, MMFPh's motif growing algorithm (Algorithm 1 in the supplementary document of their paper) will not check m since each m i (−1) has no chance to enter the queue for possible extension. However, it is possible that m is statistically significant even though all m i (−1) s are not significant at all. As a result, MMFPh may miss some motifs that are both frequent and significant, although all its constituent motifs are not significant. Here, we use a simple example to show this fact. Example 1. Suppose we have the foreground and background data set as shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. We set the significance threshold θ sig = 0.1 and the support threshold θ sup = 0.5 (i.e. the occurrence threshold is 5 in MMFPh). Under such a parameter setting, three frequent motifs are listed in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>together with their support values, significance values and overall scores. The significance value and overall score are calculated according to Equations (1) and (2) in (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Wang et al. 2012</ref>), respectively. According to MMFPh's motif growing algorithm, it is obvious that motif (I.....S......) and (.K....S....</p></div>

Clearly, MMFPh misses at least one motif which is both statistically significant and frequent in this simple example. Since the objective of MMFPh is to return all maximal, statistically significant and sufficiently frequent motifs, which has a different output from problem P1. Here, we use P2 to denote this new problem and check if MMFPh can achieve completeness with respect to P2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">P2: Maximal, significant and frequent motif discovery</head><p>If one motif m is subsumed by another motif n with more fixed animo acids, we use m ⊆ n to denote such relationship. According to<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Wang et al. (2012)</ref>, the problem P2 has the following input and output. @BULLET Input: a set of phosphorylated peptides F (foreground data), a set of unphosphorylated peptides B (background data), the significance threshold θ sig and the support threshold θ sup (MMFPh uses θ occ , where θ occ = θ sup ·|F|). @BULLET Output: a set of motifs G, where each m ∈ G satisfies:</p><formula>(1) sig(m) ≤ θ sig ; (2) sup(m) ≥ θ sup ; (3)</formula><p>for any motif n, if m ⊆ n, then sig(n) &gt;θ sig or sup(n) &lt;θ sup. To claim the completeness of MMFPh with respect to P2, one has to show that it will not miss any motif that satisfies all three requirements in the output. Unfortunately, this is also not true. As shown in Example 1, (IK....S......) is such a maximal, significant and frequent motif that cannot be reported by MMFPh. This fact illustrates the reason that MMFPh is faster than Motif-All since it reduces the search space at the cost of missing some significant and frequent motifs. From the viewpoint of solving P2, the current implementation of MMFPh should be regarded as a fast algorithm that can approximately identify most of target motifs. To identify all maximal, statistically significant and sufficiently frequent motifs with MMFPh, one has to use a new significance evaluation function that has the so-called 'downward-closure property' (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agrawal and Srikant, 1994</ref>). In other words, it can be proved that MMFPh is able to guarantee the completeness if and only if its significance evaluation function sig(m) has the following property: if sig(m) &gt; θ sig , then sig(n) &gt;θ sig for any m ⊆ n. Unfortunately, most statistical significance evaluation functions do not have such a property. Alternatively, one general solution is to post-process the output of Motif-All. More precisely, we first find the set of all frequent motifs R using the Apriori-like algorithm. Then, the significance value of each frequent motif in R is calculated to derive a new set of frequent and significant motifs RS. Finally, each motif in RS is returned if it is not subsumed by any other motif from the same set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Summary</head><p>Although the MMFPh method is useful, it may miss some (maximal) statistically significant and frequent motifs. Users should be aware of such risk in selecting the appropriate method for their tasks. Meanwhile, the complete search of Motif-All may generate many false positive motifs. To distinguish truly meaningful phosphorylation motifs from false ones, one needs to perform more rigorous statistical validation such as permutation test (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Gong and He, 2012</ref>). However, the problem of accurately and efficiently assessing the statistical significance of phosphorylation motifs still remains unsolved. More research efforts should be devoted to this direction in future research.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig.1.</head><figDesc>Fig. 1.

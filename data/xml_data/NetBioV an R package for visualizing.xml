<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Modern research in the biological and biomedical sciences is driven by technological progress that routinely allows interrogating genetic or molecular entities on a genomic scale. For the analysis and interpretation of high-throughput genomics experiments, frequently networks are used because they enable a systems approach. However, the graphical representation of networks for reasons of their exploratory analysis, interpretation or merely as a visualization is far from being trivial, especially for large networks containing hundreds or thousands of genes. For this reason, several software visualization tools have been developed. In the Supplementary File, we compared our visualization software NetBioV with Cytoscape, VisANT and yEd (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Hu et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Shannon et al., 2003</ref>). In summary, NetBioV is fully integrated into R, the gold standard in the computational biology community, and hence can use all of its functionality for user-specific expansions. Furthermore, NetBioV provides (i) global, (ii) module, (iii) information flow and (iv) hierarchical layout styles, discussed in the following, not available in this form in other packages. Importantly, the provided layout styles run efficiently, even for large networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">METHODS</head><p>The graphical representation of NetBioV is based on the igraph package (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Csardi and Nepusz, 2006</ref>) by using elementary visualization capabilities, thereof allowing the composition of advanced graph layouts. NetBioV provides four principle types of layout styles—(i) global, (ii) modular, (iii) information flow and (iv) hierarchical layouts. These can be used either separately or combined with each other, in a nested way. The reason for this conceptual subdivision is that, first, networks contain a multitude of information that cannot be visualized assuming just one specific perspective. Second, it is generally acknowledged that biological gene networks have a hierarchical and modular organizational structure (Barab asi and<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Oltvai, 2004</ref>). For this reason, selecting a layout from one of the four main categories allows to highlight a certain biological aspect of a network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Global layout styles</head><p>NetBioV provides six different style functions for generating global layouts: mst.plot, mst.plot.mod, plot.NetworkSpherical.startSet, plot. NetworkSpherical and plot.spiral.graph. The first two functions extract, initially, a minimum spanning tree (MST) from a network and, then, use a forced-based algorithm (either Fruchterman–Reingold or Kamada– Kawai) for the MST to generate the coordinates for the nodes. Finally, all remaining edges are added. In<ref type="figure">Figure 1A</ref>, we show an example using the mst.plot.mod function. White edges correspond to the MST, all other edges are in shades of orange and a darker color corresponds to more distant nodes. Furthermore, the color of the nodes reflects the expression of the genes (blue low, red high). This approach is different to all other network visualization software because by using an MST in the first step one gains a considerable advantage in the computing time it takes to calculate the coordinates of the nodes in large networks (for a numerical comparison see Supplementary File Section S3.1 and S4.5). The function plot.NetworkHubView provides a hub-view of a network placing the nodes according to their degree in a circular order, and the remaining three functions produce a star-, spherical-and spiral-view of a network (see Supplementary File).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Modular layout styles</head><p>NetBioV offers four different style functions for modular layouts: splitg.mst, plot.abstract.module, plot.abstract.nodes and plot.modules. All of these functions require as an input, information about the partitioning of the nodes in the form of modules. Modules can be identified either with module detecting algorithms (included in NetBioV) or from biomedical databases, e.g. from gene ontology (GO). For instance, the function split.mst expands the global style function mst.plot to the module level maintaining the same computational advantages using an MST. The function plot.modules allows the module-wise specification of the *To whom correspondence should be addressed. layout style representing each module, which means that it is possible to select a different layout style for each module in a network. The function plot.abstract.nodes provides an abstraction of a network, representing each module by a single node, and edges between modules are collapsed into a single edge. The size of the nodes and edges can be chosen to be proportional to the total number of nodes in a module and the edges between modules, respectively (see<ref type="figure">Fig. 1B</ref>). The resulting visualization is module-centric, and hence allows masking the connectivity on the gene level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Information flow and hierarchical layout styles</head><p>An information flow layout style highlights the shortest paths between two or more modules, or gene sets. The available functions are plot.modules and level.plot. The available function plot.modules used in<ref type="figure">Figure 1C</ref>shows the information flow between two modules. In this view, the shortest path from an initial set of nodes (red) to a destination set of nodes (yellow) is color highlighted. A large variety of features can be userspecified to enhance a desired visualization effect. Finally, we provide 2 functions (level.plot, level.plot.spread) allowing a hierarchal representation of networks. These functions assume an initial node set, N i , and plot their adjacent neighbors (measured by the Dijkstra distance) of these nodes iteratively on different levels considering the directionality of the edges (if available). For a directed network, 'level.plot.spread' shows all generations of ancestors and offsprings of N i .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Interfacing with R and object-oriented structure</head><p>For the presented examples in<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, we used various R packages for (i) identifying the modules of the protein–protein interaction (PPI) network and (ii) obtaining information about the enrichment of the modules for GO terms. Owing to the integration of NetBioV into R, interfacing with the large package repositories CRAN or Bioconductor is naturally enabled allowing to use a multitude of different features that may be used as part of the visualization of the network. Aside from this, NetBioV has an object-oriented structure allowing to combine different types of layouts seamlessly with each other. For example, it is possible to specify for each module in a network a different layout style or color scheme. That means, each of the global layout styles can be used independently as a layout style for a module.<ref type="figure">Figure 1C</ref>shows an example, where a different edge and node color are chosen for the two modules and the connecting path. For the visualization of the activity of genes or proteins, we provide a function that allows to map the expression levels onto the network by representing activity levels by different node colors to identify easily, e.g. differentially expressed genes (see<ref type="figure">Fig. 1A</ref>). Importantly, the final output of a plot can be saved as a vector graphics format (eps or pdf).</p></div>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> EXAMPLES Figure 1 shows three different network visualizations, two for the PPI network of Arabidopsis thaliana (Breitkreutz et al., 2008) (Fig. 1A and B) and one for the gene regulatory network of B-cell lymphoma, inferred with BC3NET (de Matos Simoes and Emmert-Streib, 2012) (Fig. 1C). Figure 1C can be reproduced by the following code. In the Supplementary File, we provide additional examples. 4 CONCLUSION NetBioV allows the efficient visualization of large biological networks by emphasizing important aspects of biological information processing, e.g. modularity, information flow or hierarchy. The organization of NetBioV is highly flexible enabling individualized network visualizations. Part of the functionality of NetBioV comes from its integration into R to borrow strength from existing package repositories and to ensure reproducible research by saving source code for the network visualization coordinates and parameters.</note>

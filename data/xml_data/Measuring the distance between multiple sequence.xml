				<p>Motivation: Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a core method in bioinformatics. The accuracy of such alignments may influence the success of downstream analyses such as phylogenetic inference, protein structure prediction, and functional prediction. The importance of MSA has lead to the proliferation of MSA methods, with different objective functions and heuristics to search for the optimal MSA. Different methods of inferring MSAs produce different results in all but the most trivial cases. By measuring the differences between inferred alignments, we may be able to develop an understanding of how these differences (i) relate to the objective functions and heuristics used in MSA methods, and (ii) affect downstream analyses. Results: We introduce four metrics to compare MSAs, which include the position in a sequence where a gap occurs or the location on a phylogenetic tree where an insertion or deletion (indel) event occurs. We use both real and synthetic data to explore the information given by these metrics and demonstrate how the different metrics in combination can yield more information about MSA methods and the differences between them. Availability: MetAl is a free software implementation of these metrics in Haskell. Source and binaries for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X are available from http://kumiho.smith.man.ac.uk/whelan/software/ metal/.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Many methods used in bioinformatics require one or more accurate multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) as input. Each MSA arranges a set of homologous amino acid or nucleotide sequences in a matrix, where each column of the matrix corresponds to a set of characters that are homologous, functionally related or superposable in a protein structure (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Edgar and Batzoglou, 2006</ref>). These definitions may coincide when the sequences are closely related, but may conflict as the sequences diverge. Methods of phylogenetic tree reconstruction (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Felsenstein, 2003</ref>), structure prediction (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Arnold et al., 2006</ref>), functional annotation (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Eisen, 1998</ref>) and the creation of profile hidden Markov models for database searching (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Eddy, 2009</ref>) all depend on an alignment, and the performance of these methods depends inevitably on the accuracy of these alignments. A variety of MSA methods have been developed over the past two decades that are still in active use (<ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Notredame, 2007</ref>), including methods that co-estimate trees and alignment (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hagopian et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Liu et al., *</ref>To whom correspondence should be addressed.</p><p>2009;<ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Redelings and Suchard, 2005</ref>). These algorithms vary in their objective function and the heuristic used to find the best MSA. The performance of MSA methods is frequently assessed by their ability to recover a reference alignment (e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Golubchik et al., 2007</ref>), which may be produced from biological information, such as a conserved structure (<ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Thompson et al., 2005</ref>). The output of each method can then be scored against the reference alignment, either by the fraction of residue pairs in the reference alignment that are correctly identified by a given method, known as the Sum-of-Pairs (SP) score, or by the Total Column (TC) score, which describes the fraction of reference columns identified (<ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Thompson et al., 2005</ref>). Several studies have noted the effect of sequence alignment algorithm on, for example, phylogenetic tree topology (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Cantarel et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hall, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Morrison and Ellis, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ogden and Rosenberg, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Wang et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Wong et al., 2008</ref>). Many of these studies used simulated data and the parameter of interest was generally assessed against alignment quality, measured as TC or SP score against the true alignment. Neither the TC nor the SP score are true metrics because they violate the principles of symmetry and the triangle inequality (see below). Producing a valid metric would allow alignment to be projected as points in an alignment space, enabling the comparison of distances between different MSA methods or across different datasets. When these comparisons include a reference alignment, the metric would give some indication of the similarity of alignment methods as well as an accuracy score. Alternatively, such a metric could be used to characterize alignment uncertainty. Previous work on uncertainty has relied on annotating a 'best' alignment with uncertainty information based on the proportion of base pairs that are present when the sequences are reversed before alignment (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Landan and Graur, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Wise, 2010</ref>), or when the guide tree is varied (<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Penn et al., 2010</ref>). A true metric could also provide direct comparison of equally or similarly high scoring paths through the dynamic programming matrix produced during MSA, allowing one to identify regions of high uncertainty in the final alignment. In this study, we derive four true metrics for the comparison of MSAs:</p><p>(i) a simple correction to the SP score; (ii) a metric that incorporates raw gap information; (iii) a metric that includes the position where gaps occur in a sequence; and (iv) a metric that includes the position where insertion/deletion (indel) events occur both in a sequence and on a phylogenetic tree. We proceed to demonstrate that the SP and TP score are not metrics and cannot be used to investigate many questions about how MSA methods perform. We then show the usefulness of our metrics on MSAs produced by a selection of methods on real data extracted from BAliBASE (<ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Thompson et al., 2005</ref>), and simulated data produced using INDELible (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Fletcher and Yang, 2009</ref>). Through these analyses, we also demonstrate that the combined use of our metrics can identify similarities and differences betweenPage: 496 495–502</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">General definitions</head><p>Consider a set of n sequences S ={S 1 ,S 2 ,...,S n } where the j-th character in sequence i is denoted S i j and the sum of the sequence lengths is given by c = i |S i |. Also consider a phylogenetic tree, T , that describes the evolutionary relatedness of the sequences in S by a series of edges, e ={e 1 ,e 2 ,...,e 2n−3 } where e k describes an edge in the tree that splits S into two non-empty sets. Distances between MSAs should compare where in the MSAs each observable character, S i j , is placed in relation to the characters in the other sequences. We begin by assigning S i j to a homology set, which contains the characters in the other sequences that share a common ancestor with S i j .</p><p>Where there is no such relationship due to an indel, the set may include a character representing the gap state. When assigning such homology sets, we may also wish to include additional information in the labelling of the gap states to alter the information given by the distance. First, we can include information about the placement of the gap characters in their respective sequences. Secondly, we can include information about the likely edge that corresponds to the location of the indel event on the tree that resulted in the gap.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Recoding the insertion and deletion history of an alignment</head><p>The next step in computing a distance between alignments is to recode the alignment so that all the characters and gaps can be correctly compared. The transition from S to an alignment requires the placement of gap characters, which represent all the indels that have occurred during the history of the sequences. We assume no direction to evolution and, therefore, cannot differentiate between insertions or deletions. To incorporate information from indels, we recode gap characters in our alignments in one of four ways (see<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>for examples):</p><p>(1) SSP: the 'Symmetrized SP' recoding ignores gaps and treats them as blanks in an alignment. The name reflects the similarity to the existing SP method for comparing alignments.</p><p>(2) seq: this recoding provides a simple record of gap information and treats all gaps in a sequence equally. Each gap is simply recoded as G i , indicating it occurred in sequence i.</p><p>(3) pos: our third recoding incorporates the positional information about where a gap occurs in a sequence, but not the temporal (phylogenetic) location of the indel that produced the gap. Each gap is labelled as G i j , where j is the location of the real character to the left. In<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>, both gaps occurring after the first character in Sequence 3 are labelled as G 3 1. Note any gap occurring before the first character would be labelled G i 0 .</p><p>(4) evol: our final recoding includes all the information of pos recoding, and also incorporates where the indel event leading to that gap occurs in a phylogenetic tree. Each column in an alignment is considered independently and the indel history inferred as the most parsimonious set of events under Dollo parsimony (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Huson and Steel, 2004</ref>). Dollo parsimony enforces that the history of each column is restricted to a maximum of one insertion and any number of deletion events, with the mapping of indel events to edges the same regardless of the tree rooting. Gap characters in the column are then recoded using the nomenclature G i j (k), where k is an index used to label edges in the tree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Enforcing a unique representation of an alignment</head><p>When comparing MSAs, the first step is to ensure that any given assignment of gaps has a unique representation in alignment space. When gaps are considered as independent events, the order of some columns in an alignment may be arbitrary. For example, the last two columns in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>could be placed in any order because they contain no overlapping bases. To enforce a unique alignment representation, we reorder sequences alphabetically by their names. We then sort the non-overlapping columns so that the leftmost column contains a gap in a higher row than the column to the right.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Including evolutionary information</head><p>The labelling step for the evol recoding requires a tree in order to label each gap by the inferred indel event that caused it, assuming that each position in a multi-site gap can be considered independently. Although this approach is not ideal from a biological perspective, it does allow efficient and simple computation of where indels occur on the tree. Allowing gaps to span multiple columns makes identifying their placement on the tree more difficult, because there may be many equally parsimonious solutions for gap placement (<ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Simmons and Ochoterena, 2000</ref>), each of which may induce a different homology assignment to a site and result in a different distance between alignments. Our approach may be viewed as similar to using a linear gap penalty when identifying where an indel occurs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Comparing homology sets</head><p>Once a pair of alignments are recoded appropriately the process of calculating the distances between them can begin. The first step is to calculate the sitewise homology set for each alignment under each metric, so for alignment A and metric X ∈{SSP,seq,pos,evol} we have H X (A) ={H X (A) i j }. To create the homology set H X (A) i j , one identifies the column in alignment A with character S i j and store all the other characters in that column, including gaps if they are labelled. Note that gaps do not have a homology set of their</p></div>

For example, taking the evol recoding from<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>the homology set for sequence character S 2 3 is H evol (A) 2 3 ={S 1 5 ,G 3 2 (2)}. We define the d SSP metric as the Jaccard distance on the homology sets H SSP. Previous research has shown the Jaccard distance to be a valid metric (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lipkus, 1999</ref>).</p><formula>d SSP (A,B) = 1− i j |H(A) i j ∩H(B) i j | i j |H(B) i j ∪H(A) i j | (1)</formula><p>We call this measure of distance between alignments our Symmetrized SP (SSP) metric, reflecting its inspiration from the original SP score. This metric has a mixture of desirable and undesirable properties. It has a direct link to the information used by most methods of sequence analysis (homology pairs), but the contribution of base-gap pairs to the metric is less clear. By explicitly encoding gap characters, we can extend the metric to include other information that may be considered important. For the remaining three metrics, we can define them such that they take advantage of the fact that the homology set sizes remain constant for any given alignment. In<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>, for example, one can see that for seq, pos and evol recoding every homology set is of size n−1, in contrast to SSP where the size of homology sets varies between alignments. We take advantage of this consistency to use the following to compute the distance metric d X (A,B) i j for X ∈{seq,pos,evol}:</p><formula>d X (A,B) i j = |H X (A) i j H X (B) i j | |H X (A) i j |+|H X (B) i j | (2)</formula><p>The numerator of this equation is the symmetric difference, which in our case is equivalent to the Hamming distance, as each member of H X (A) i j has a corresponding member in H X (B) i j. Previous research has shown the Hamming distance is a true metric (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Deza and Deza, 2009</ref>). The inclusion of gaps in the homology sets means the normalizing denominator in equation 2 is constant for any given alignment of the same set of sequences, and therefore |H X (A) i j |=|H X (B) i j |. A function remains a metric after normalization by a constant. The formulation of a per character homology distance allows us to compute two useful quantities. First, we can compute the distance between a pair of alignments by taking the average across all characters in the sequences.</p><formula>d(A,B) = 1 c i j d(A,B) i j (3)</formula><p>The second quantity of interest is a measure of how differently the characters of a single sequence S i are incorporated into two MSAs. This metric could, in principle, be used to identify sources of error in aligners, particularly those associated with a guide tree.</p><formula>d(A,B) i = 1 |S i | j d(A,B) i j (4)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Interpreting alignment distances</head><p>The metrics described here provide a distance between two alignments that lies between 0 and 1. Note that this distance can equally be expressed as a percentage. For d seq , d pos and d evol , these distances can be interpreted as the probability that a randomly selected base (x) will be aligned to a different location against a sequence randomly selected from the n−1 sequences that do not contain x. The remaining metric, d SSP , represents the fraction of pairings between observable characters that overlap in the two alignments. The limitations of this metric are best demonstrated by example. Consider an arbitrary alignment of n sequences each of length l. If we modify this alignment by breaking the homology between two bases and aligning them both with gaps, the distance between the two alignments under d seq will be 2 ln(n−1). Under d SSP , the distance will depend on how many pairwise homologies are present in the starting alignment; if more pairwise homologies are inferred, then the denominator will be larger, and so the difference between the two alignments will be smaller. In other words, the structure of one part of the alignment affects the distance caused by a change in another part of the alignment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7">Alignment programs examined</head><p>To demonstrate the performance and usefulness of our four metrics, we use them to compare the alignments produced from a range of popular alignment programs with their default options on two different datasets. We consider the progressive aligners ClustalW (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Larkin et al., 2007</ref>); Muscle (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Edgar, 2004</ref>); MAFFT's FFT–NS–i algorithm (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Katoh and Toh, 2008</ref>), which includes additional refinement steps; DIALIGN–TX (<ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Subramanian et al., 2008</ref>), which includes an additional greedy matching step; the consistency aligners T–Coffee (<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Notredame, 2000</ref>), ProbCons (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Do et al., 2005</ref>) and the L–INS–i algorithm of MAFFT; and the phylogenetically aware aligner Prank, with the recommended '+F' option (<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Löytynoja and Goldman, 2008</ref>). Although other non-default parameters have the potential to improve the quality of alignments, our aim is not to judge alignment quality but to show how the metrics presented here reveal differences in the algorithms. We examine two datasets, one synthetic, and one real (described below). For each dataset examined, we align the sequences using each of the procedures detailed above. We also include the true or reference alignment for comparison. Given these alignments, we can calculate the all-against-all set of distances under each of the four metrics proposed here. We visualise mean distance matrices using the heatmap.2 package from the gplots R package. The mean distance is equivalent to a renormalized Manhattan distance; results using the euclidean distance are similar but a mean distance is more interpretable. Where d evol was used a reference phylogenetic tree topology was required. For the BAliBASE alignments, a maximum-likelihood tree was generated using RAxML (<ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Stamatakis, 2006</ref>) on the BAliBASE reference alignment. For the synthetic data, the reference tree was the tree used to generate the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7.1">Test data 1: BAliBASE</head><p>We examine alignment performance on three sections of the BAliBASE 3 database, which has been widely used to assess the performance of alignment algorithms at recovering reference alignments derived from protein structure information. We use sections RV12 (mediumto-divergent sequences with 20–40% identity), RV30 (subfamilies) and RV50 (internal insertions), with 20 alignments randomly chosen from each section for subsequent analysis. Results are also presented for the truncated versions of the same sequences, containing only the homologous regions. Alignments contain between 4 and 142 sequences (mean of 34.9).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7.2">Test data 2: synthetic data</head><p>Simulated data provides a useful test of alignment where all properties of the data are known, at the cost of not reflecting the complexity of real data. In this study, we use synthetic data to assess the effect of evolutionary distance on alignment. We generate data under a balanced tree topology with eight leaves, where all 14 branches are of equal length and the total tree branch length is one of {0.14,0.42,0.84,1.4,2.8,7}. We also generate a second dataset with an unbalanced tree where each internal branch has equal length and the overall tree length is scaled the same as the corresponding balanced tree. All trees used are clock-like. INDELible v1.03 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Fletcher and Yang, 2009</ref>) was used to simulate data under the WAG (<ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Whelan and Goldman, 2001</ref>) substitution matrix, with an indel rate parameter of 0.1 and a power-law indel length distribution with parameter a = 1.7. The root sequence has length 1000, and 20 replicates were made of each run.</p></div>

The asymmetry occurs because the denominator may be different for each alignment. Note this asymmetry is also true for the similarly defined TC score. The overlap score (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lassmann and Sonnhammer, 2002</ref>), another related measure of alignment similarity, introduces symmetry and is defined as:</p><formula>Q ab = i j |H SSP (A) i j ∩H SSP (B) i j | ( i j |H SSP (B) i j |+|H SSP (A) i j |)/2 (6)</formula><p>This formulation is also known as Dice's Coefficient and its dissimilarity measure, defined as 1−Q ab , does not satisfy the triangle inequality and so is not a valid metric (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Leach and Gillet, 2003</ref>). Failure to satisfy the triangle inequality means that the alignment distances A↔B, A↔C, and B↔C cannot be projected into Euclidean space. In other words, the path A→B→C may be shorter than the direct path A→C. These theoretical failings expose a major limitation of existing scores: although they can calculate a measure of similarity to a reference alignment, they cannot be used for all-against-all comparisons, with or without a reference. This limitation is illustrated in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>, where we show that existing metrics prevent any meaningful comparison between a set of toy MSAs. In<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3A</ref>, we align two short sequences using three alignment programs. In<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3B</ref>, we calculate SP differences between the three alignments, but because we need to normalize the SP (and TC) score using one of the alignments as a referencealignment, the distance (e.g.) A→B is different to the distance B→A, demonstrating that the SP (and TC) violates the symmetry requirement for a distance. To demonstrate how the choice of reference alignment affects these scores,<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3C</ref>demonstrates the different conclusions drawn when each MSA is taken to be the reference. If we take A to be the reference, we infer that B and C are equally similar to A, perhaps concluding that B and C are equally good aligners. However, if we take B to be the reference alignment, we find A and B produce the same alignment, whereas C is maximally different. In this case, we would conclude B is an excellent method and C is a poor method. One may try to solve these problems by taking the mean of the score A↔B and B↔A. This approach enforces symmetry, but the resultant distances do not obey the triangle inequality. In<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3D</ref>, we demonstrate that averaged distances result in a triangle between A, B and C that cannot exist in Euclidean space. These observations make evident the need for a true alignment metric that allows accurate comparison between alignment methods. We have implemented the metrics described in Section 2 in the command-line program MetAl. Below, we demonstrate the utility of these metrics by examining the performance of MSA methods using real and simulated sequence data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Comparing alignment methods using BAliBASE</head><p>Mean distances across the full BAliBASE alignments from RV12, RV30 and RV50 are plotted for d evol as the upper part of<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>. The trends for other metrics are similar and generally highly correlated (d evol and d seq is the least correlated pair, with r 2 = 0.68). The different subgroups tested (RV12, RV30 and RV50) are also correlated, with r 2 &gt; 0.85 for d evol. Our results show that all methods produce alignments in which bases share the majority of their base– base or base–gap pairings with the reference alignment (distance:). Prank has a noticeable tendency to have high distances to other aligners (43.5–49.4%). These results suggest that although the different MSA methods are producing alignments that are roughly of equal similarity to the BAliBASE alignment, the way they achieve these alignments can be quite different. BAliBASE also provides alignments where only regions of identified homology are included. Results for these datasets are plotted below the diagonal of<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Comparing alignment methods using data simulated by INDELible</head><p>To investigate the performance of our metrics on alignments with a known origin and history, we apply the metrics to data simulated using INDELible on a balanced and an unbalanced tree, each with tree length of 1.4. The mean values of d evol are plotted in a matrix in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>across the balanced (upper matrix) and unbalanced (lower matrix) datasets. These figures show that the differences between methods are more pronounced in simulated data relative to real data, with ClustalW performing noticeably worse than other methods. In both examples, the phylogenetically aware aligner, Prank, has the best performance, although MAFFT L–INS–i also performs well. The performance of Prank may be expected because its alignment model closely resembles that used by INDELible to generate the data. To explore the effect of increasing evolutionary distance on accuracy, we examine the average distance from the true alignment for a subset of methods for d seq and d evol under a range of evolutionary divergences on balanced trees. The trends for unbalanced trees are similar. For d seq , we find that as the A Bevolutionary divergence increases, the distance between alignments inferred by the MSA methods also begins to increase, but it reaches a maximum distance when the tree length is ∼4, and then plateaus or declines (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 6A</ref>). In contrast, for d evol the distance between inferred MSAs and the true MSA steadily increases as evolutionary divergence increases (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 6B</ref>). Curves for d pos and d SSP are similar to d evol , reaching 1.0 at or after a tree length of 7. The differences between d seq and d evol in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref>are due to the way they treat gaps in the divergent sequences. For d seq , the decrease in alignment distance for divergent sequences occurs because the majority of amino acids are aligning with gap characters, which cannot be distinguished from one another. On the other hand, d evol includes evolutionary and positional information about gaps, which allows the metric to correctly identify falsely inferred indel events. Equation (4) makes it possible to calculate how differently a pair of MSAs treat a single sequence, potentially highlighting sequences that are aligned particularly inconsistently between two methods. We investigate this approach by examining the performance of the different MSA methods on simple balanced and unbalanced tree topologies. We expect that each sequence on the balanced tree will have a similar distance under the same method, but for the unbalanced tree the most distantly related sequences will be harder to align than the more closely related sequences. In<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref>, we use simulation to investigate the distance from the true alignment of individual sequences for equal length balanced and unbalanced trees using the d evol metric. The results match our expectations. For balanced trees, all leaf nodes are topologically identical, and the observed distances between sequence are broadly similar. For the unbalanced tree, we observe it is harder to align sequences from long terminal branches than those from short terminal branches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Relationship between metrics</head><p>The structure of our metrics enforces the relationship d evol ≥ d pos ≥ d seq , with the lack of gap information in d SSP making it somewhat different from the other three metrics. Our results demonstrate that incorporating positional and evolutionary information can provide useful information to a bioinformatician. BAliBASE, example BB12038, contains one sequence that is much longer than the others,with a length of 2314 aa relative to the next longest of 437 aa. The extreme nature of this alignment makes it a useful case study. Results comparing alignment methods on BB12038 are plotted in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 8</ref>below the diagonal. For comparison, scores for a more typical alignment are plotted above the diagonal. By considering each of the four metrics in turn, using the distance from the reference sequence to ClustalW and Prank, we can evaluate the information encoded by each metric. In the case of d SSP , the distance between ClustalW and the reference is 0.37, so of all the base–base pairs across the two alignments, 63% of them are present in both. For Prank, the distance is larger (0.44). Substantially lower distances are seen under d seq (Prank = 0.19 and ClustalW = 0.14). The d SSP distance is not nested in the other distances, so care should be taken when comparing the other distances with d SSP. In this case, we interpret the large decrease as evidence that the alignments are quite gappy and those locations aligned to gaps in the reference alignment also tend to be aligned with gaps by the MSA methods. Under d pos , the distance increases only slightly for ClustalW (0.17) but Prank increases to 0.47, indicating that many of the gap locations differ between the Prank and reference alignments. A small further increase under d evol is observed (ClustalW = 0.18, Prank = 0.50). Prank frequently aligns bases to gaps located differently from the reference alignment, but only occasionally corresponding to different events in time. To explore further the similarities and differences between our metrics, we investigate the distances they produce on BAliBASE RV12. We plot the distances between all pairs of aligners across all data from RV12 as scatterplots.<ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>shows comparisons between d SSP and our gap-aware metrics d seq (<ref type="figure">Fig. 9A</ref>) and d pos (<ref type="figure">Fig. 9B</ref>). The inclusion of non-specific gap information in d seq means that it tends to produce lower distances than d SSP as characters aligned with gaps in both alignments reduce the distance. This observation reinforces the result presented in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6A</ref>, where d seq tends to decrease after a certain degree of divergence. The comparison between d SSP and d pos shows no such clean relationship, with d SSP sometimes being greater than or less than d pos. This variation is because for d pos the location of the gap is important, so if two methods align gappy regions similarly d pos is lower than d SSP , whereas for inconsistent gappy regions d pos is greater than d SSP. The substantial differences between d pos and d seq are also illustrated in<ref type="figure">Figure 9C</ref>. In common with the d SSP and d seq comparison, these differences arise due to the treatment of gaps. The definitions enforce the relationship d pos ≥ d seq , but sometimes d pos is substantially higher than d seq and we infer that such alignments are gappy with much variation in the base-gap homology assignments.<ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>. Scatterplots of distances calculated according to different metrics on the RV12 BAliBASE dataset. Each circle corresponds to a single distance computed on one set of homologous sequences from RV12 between alignments performed by two of: ClustalW, Muscle, ProbCons, T–Coffee, Prank, MAFFT L–INS–i and MAFFT FFT–NS–i. A solid line is plotted to indicate x = y.<ref type="figure">Figure 9D</ref>shows that d pos ≈ d evol , which suggests that the different placement of gaps by different aligners rarely alters the inferred evolutionary history of indel events in the RV12 dataset.</p></div>

			<note place="foot" n="4"> DISCUSSION In this study, we have defined four metrics to compare MSAs. Our metrics are superior to the most commonly used scores (i.e. the SP and TC scores) in two ways. First, our scores are valid metrics, whereas existing methods, such as the SP and TC scores are not. Secondly, our methods can incorporate indel information, including their location and when they occur during evolution. In contrast to existing scores, our metrics also allow the simple comparison of sets of sequence alignments, allowing us to investigate how similar methods of sequence alignment are to one another rather than how well individual alignments compare to a reference alignment. This is an important difference; we find that for real data, different alignment methods tend to produce alignments with similar magnitude in distance to the BAliBASE reference alignment, but that these inferred alignments are frequently at least as different from one another as they are from the reference alignment. A multitude of studies have examined the effect of sequence misalignment on, for example, phylogenetic inference (Cantarel et al., 2006; Hall, 2005; Morrison and Ellis, 1997; Ogden and Rosenberg, 2006; Wang et al., 2011; Wong et al., 2008), detection of positive selection (Fletcher and Yang, 2010; Markova-Raina and Petrov, 2011; Schneider et al., 2009; Wong et al., 2008), detection of co-varying sites in proteins (Dickson et al., 2010), studies of non-coding DNA (Pollard et al., 2006) and protein structure prediction (Miklos et al., 2008). The metrics introduced here will permit several important analyses that may benefit such studies. First, our metrics allow the direct comparison of alternative alignments and their outcomes, which may be especially important as different algorithms may be subject to similar kinds of bias (Golubchik et al., 2007). Second, comparing the differences between our metrics allows one to examine how variation in an alignment correlates with differences observed in downstream analyses. Finally, comparing sets of optimal or near-optimal alignments may allow one to discriminate between the effects brought about by uncertainty in an alignment and bias introduced by the alignment algorithms. By providing valid metrics for the direct comparison of alignments, we hope future studies will be able to more thoroughly understand the similarities and differences between alignment methods, and make progress in the task of disentangling alignment heuristics from their effect on downstream inference.</note>

				<p>Motivation: The human microbiome plays a key role in health and disease. Thanks to comparative metatranscriptomics, the cellular functions that are deregulated by the microbiome in disease can now be computationally explored. Unlike gene-centric approaches, pathway-based methods provide a systemic view of such functions; however, they typically consider each pathway in isolation and in its entirety. They can therefore overlook the key differences that (i) span multiple pathways, (ii) contain bidirectionally deregulated components, (iii) are confined to a pathway region. To capture these properties, computational methods that reach beyond the scope of predefined pathways are needed. Results: By integrating an existing module discovery algorithm into comparative metatranscrip-tomic analysis, we developed metaModules, a novel computational framework for automated identification of the key functional differences between health-and disease-associated communities. Using this framework, we recovered significantly deregulated subnetworks that were indeed recognized to be involved in two well-studied, microbiome-mediated oral diseases, such as butanoate production in periodontal disease and metabolism of sugar alcohols in dental caries. More importantly , our results indicate that our method can be used for hypothesis generation based on automated discovery of novel, disease-related functional subnetworks, which would otherwise require extensive and laborious manual assessment.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The human microbiome is a functional community that plays an important role in health and disease (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Huttenhower et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Mitra et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Morgan et al., 2012</ref>). Disorders that have been previously linked to, for instance, the gut microbiome, include cardiovascular disease (<ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Wang et al., 2011</ref>) and type 2 diabetes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Qin et al., 2012</ref>). Because distinct populations of microbes from different patients can harbor remarkably similar functional capabilities (<ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Turnbaugh et al., 2009</ref>), the pathogeneses of these diseases may not necessarily be related to specific microbial population shifts from the health-associated microbiome. Phenotypic differences are therefore better explained by changes in the regulation of cellular mechanisms, for instance in the form of under-or overexpression of certain metabolic pathways or parts thereof. A prerequisite for this is the ability to identify differentially expressed functional systems using computational pipelines that can operate at the systems level. The availability of such pipelines is likely to lead to increased discovery of preventive and therapeutic targets in microbiome-related diseases. Metagenomics and metatranscriptomics are two powerful approaches for studying, respectively, the functional capability and activity of microorganisms in environmental and clinical samples. The latter provides a more direct view into disease-associated factors since microbial activity is often clinically more relevant than microbial genetic potential. Supporting this are recent observations of many metagenomically abundant gene families being consistently downregulated at the transcriptional level, for instance, in the human gut microbiome (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Franzosa et al., 2014</ref>). Comparative metatranscriptomics (meta-RNA-Seq) aims at identifying the functions that are significantly differentially expressed by microbial communities under different conditions. Because the number of active microbial genes can reach up to several millions, the functional profile of a sample is commonly constructed by mapping mRNA reads first to genes, and then to higher-level functional units such as KEGG Orthology groups (KOs,<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kanehisa and Goto, 2000</ref>). KOs are organism-independent identifiers that group together proteins of similar biochemical functions. As with genes, they can be used to perform differential expression analysis using packages such as edgeR (<ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Robinson et al., 2010</ref>) and DESeq2 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Love et al., 2014</ref>). Since interpreting results at KO level is not straightforward, this is typically followed by pathway or gene set enrichment analysis (<ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Subramanian et al., 2005</ref>) (as in<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Marchetti et al., 2012</ref>). Another common approach is to use bioinformatics pipelines such as MEGAN (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Huson et al., 2007</ref>) or HUMAnN (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abubucker et al., 2012</ref>) to map KOs to predefined functional modules and pathways, such as those in the KEGG and MetaCyc (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Caspi et al., 2014</ref>) databases, and then to identify the deregulated functional units (as in<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Franzosa et al., 2014</ref>). Pathway-based approaches provide invaluable insights into disease biology; however, they have a number of shortcomings that are critical for the identification of functional markers. First, they consider each predefined pathway individually and therefore ignore the interactions between pathways that may be crucial for discovering causal biochemical mechanisms. Second, collapsing the expression levels of KOs into pathways or modules can have two undesired outcomes: non-differentially but highly expressed functions within a pathway can obfuscate significant differences of other parts of the same pathway. Moreover, pathways that contain up-and downregulated genes may be determined as non-differentially expressed overall. Finally, significantly deregulated pathway regions that are not covered by predefined module delineations cannot be identified.</p><p>Methods that address the above limitations of pathway-based methods have been previously reported. By combining protein-protein interaction networks with gene expression data,<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ideker et al. (2002)</ref>introduced the concept of identifying connected subsets of regulatory genes that are responsible for changes in expression under different conditions. This concept has since been extended to other settings, including networks of enzymatic (<ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Patil and Nielsen, 2005</ref>) and regulatory elements (<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Oliveira et al., 2008</ref>). The central idea in these methods can be summarized in three main steps: (i) constructing a mathematical network (graph) that captures the core molecular interactions in biological pathways, (ii) assigning numerical scores that reflect biological activity (or response) to the components (edges/nodes) in the network and finally (iii) performing a search on the network to identify the highly scoring subnetworks that delineate the biological hotspots from the rest of the network [for a review, see<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Mitra et al. (2013)]</ref>. The current work introduces metaModules; a novel approach that focuses on comparative metatranscriptomic datasets for identifying metabolic subnetworks of significantly deregulated orthologous gene groups. An earlier work in this direction is MetaPath (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Liu and Pop, 2011</ref>), a method for finding differentially abundant enzymatic subnetworks in metagenomic datasets. The biological questions addressed by our method and MetaPath are fundamentally different: whereas MetaPath is specifically designed to find subnetworks of reactions that are either enriched or depleted as a whole in a given experimental condition, metaModules focuses on finding connected subsets of significantly deregulated ortholog gene groups. Note that the subnetworks discovered by MetaPath do not have to be composed of significantly differentially abundant or expressed elements. Instead, the statistical significance of these subnetworks is evaluated using a bootstrapping strategy. On the other hand, as it is designed with a metatranscriptomic focus, our approach uses statistics that are tailored to the properties of RNA-Seq data. Following the work by<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dittrich et al. (2008)</ref>, our method specifically searches for connected subnetworks that predominantly contain significantly differentially expressed KOs, which can be either up-or downregulated in different experimental conditions. Finally, the exact search algorithm used by metaModules, Heinz (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dittrich et al., 2008</ref>), guarantees to find the optimal maximum-scoring subnetwork within the input network. We applied metaModules to previously published metatranscriptomic datasets of two well-studied, oral microbiome-related diseases: periodontal disease and dental caries. Periodontal (gum) disease originates from an unbalanced host-microbiome interaction that leads to an enhanced host inflammatory response. If left untreated, it causes the destruction of tooth-supporting structures and may eventually result in tooth loss (<ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Pihlstrom et al., 2005</ref>). Dental caries (tooth decay) is one of the most common chronic diseases, where the main cause is a net overproduction of acids during microbial carbohydrate fermentation in the oral cavity, leading to the demineralization of dental hard tissues (<ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Selwitz et al., 2007</ref>). Using metaModules, we recovered significantly deregulated connected subnetworks of functions that are important in a number of mechanisms previously associated with these diseases, such as the production of metabolites that inhibit human cell growth in periodontal disease. Our results indicate that using high throughput data, our methodology can be used to generate new hypotheses automatically by uncovering novel disease-related metabolic mechanisms in microbial communities. Although we demonstrated it on microbiomerelated disease datasets in this study, metaModules can be used for datasets from any type of comparative metatranscriptomic studies.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Metatranscriptomic data</head><p>We applied metaModules to metatranscriptomic datasets from recently published studies of periodontal disease (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Jorth et al., 2014</ref>) and dental caries (<ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Peterson et al., 2014</ref>). The periodontal disease (PD) dataset consisted of patient-matched healthy (n ¼ 3) and diseased (n ¼ 3) microbiome samples, each prepared by pooling subgingival plaque from three healthy or diseased teeth. The dental caries (DC) dataset comprised of supragingival plaque samples collected from all dental surfaces of 36 individuals who had either a cariespositive (n ¼ 19) or a caries-negative (n ¼ 17) oral health profile.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Preprocessing and mapping of reads</head><p>All methods within our pipeline mentioned below were used with default parameters except where noted. Sickle v1.210 (available at https://github.com/najoshi/sickle) was used to trim the 50-bp (PD) and 100-bp (DC) single-end reads using an average quality score of 15 over a sliding window of 10% of the read length. Trimmed sequences shorter than 30-bp (PD) or 60-bp (DC) and those that contained more than 10% ambiguous bases were discarded. Next, human mRNA reads were filtered by Best Match Tagger v1.1.0 (available at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/agarwala/bmtagger/) using the NCBI database of human mRNA transcripts predicted by NCBI Gnomon. Subsequently, SortMeRNA v1.99-beta (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kopylova et al., 2012</ref>) was used to filter the non-coding RNAs in the remaining reads. As a second step for removing non-coding RNAs, the reads were aligned using USEARCH (v7.0.1090,-usearch_local, Edgar, 2010) to a combination of sequences from the GtRNAdb tRNA database (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chan and Lowe, 2009</ref>) and the SSURef_NR99 and LSURef sequences (release 115) from the SILVA database (<ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Quast et al., 2013</ref>). An E-value cutoff of 1.0 and an identity threshold of 0.5 were used for the mapping, and mapped reads with bit-scores &gt;54 were removed as recommended by<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Leimena et al. (2013)</ref>. The remaining reads were aligned to a custom KEGG database (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kanehisa and Goto, 2000</ref>) of 3 002 391 proteins from 2965 organisms. Each protein in the database was a member of at least one of the 8940 KEGG Orthology groups (KO). Each KO was further categorized under one or more of the 369 KEGG pathway maps. The nucleotide-to-protein search, where the top 10 hits were kept for the query reads, was performed using the ublast command in USEARCH v7.0.1090 with an E-value threshold of 1000 for the PD and of 10 for the DC dataset. For the PD dataset, a high E-value threshold was required for mapping a sufficient number of short reads (30-to 50-bp) in each sample; however, to minimize the ambiguity of matches in this case, a read coverage of 0.8 and an identity level of 0.7 were used as additional alignment cutoffs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Differential expression analysis</head><p>one-sided test can be used in the differential expression analysis step to specifically search for subnetworks that are up-or downregulated as a whole. After the annotation of the KO network with weights, Heinz was used to identify the MSS in each dataset. The networks were visualized using the eXamine plugin (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dinkla et al., 2014</ref>) in Cytoscape (<ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Shannon et al., 2003</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Contribution of species to deregulated KOs</head><p>We determined the change in the contribution of individual organisms to the identified subnetworks in health and disease (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. S1</ref>). Performing differential expression analysis at both gene and KO level allowed us to obtain the mean expression levels of genes and KOs in the healthy and diseased patient groups. Note that the genes in our approach were annotated not only with KOs but also with species using KEGG. Therefore, we were able to determine the contribution of a species in terms of its gene expression to the KOs in the MSSs in different phenotypes. In our approach, each species s consists of a set of active genes G s ¼ {g s,1 ,g s,2 ,. .. }. Similarly, each KO i in an MSS contains one or more genes from a number of organisms G i ¼ {g i,1 , g i,2 ,. .. }. The log fold change in the expression of KO i for species s was then determined by:</p><formula>FC s;i ¼ log 2 X g2Gi\Gs g d X g2Gi\Gs g h 0 @ 1 A (2)</formula><p>where g d and g h are the mean expression values of gene g across diseased and healthy patient groups, respectively. Subsequently, for each dataset, we identified the 10 species that showed the largest upand downregulation in disease across all KOs in the MSSs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7">Comparison with other methods</head><p>We compared our method with MetaPath (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Liu and Pop, 2011</ref>), the only method currently available for identifying differentially abundant MSSs in metagenomic datasets. We ran MetaPath with default parameters to identify MSSs in the DC dataset (the PD dataset was omitted since MetaPath is not applicable to paired samples). Among the significant MSSs reported by the algorithm for the health-and disease-associated phenotypes, we considered only the top-scoring MSS for each phenotype. These enzymatic reaction subnetworks were mapped back to a subnetwork of KOs, where the KO interactions were determined using the global reaction network and the reaction-to-KO mapping file provided with the MetaPath. The topology of the global reaction network used by MetaPath differs from the global KO network used in metaModules. To enable a consistent comparison, we transformed MetaPath's directed network of reactions into an undirected network of KOs. We ran metaModules using an FDR ¼ 0.15 on this network to obtain an MSS of similar size to the top-scoring MSSs obtained by MetaPath.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Results and discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Processing and mapping of reads</head><p>In total, we processed nearly two billion metatranscriptomic reads from a periodontal disease (PD,<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Jorth et al., 2014</ref>) and a dental caries (DC,<ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Peterson et al., 2014</ref>) dataset. Both sets consisted of microbiome RNA samples taken from healthy and diseased conditions. The reads were processed through three filtering steps: (i) quality control, (ii) host mRNA filtering and (iii) removal of non-coding RNAs. In the PD dataset, 53% of the reads were removed after the quality control due to the large number of very short reads (15-bp) that mainly comprised two of the three healthy samples (<ref type="figure">Table 1</ref>). The percentage of non-coding RNAs in the remaining reads was remarkably low (12%). On the contrary, the vast majority of reads (93%) in the DC dataset passed the quality control; however, almost 85% of the reads were discarded after the removal of non-coding RNAs, indicating substantial non-coding RNA contamination in the samples. Both of the datasets contained similarly low levels of host mRNA contamination (&lt;2%). Both datasets had similar levels of reads mapped to KEGG genes (&lt;6%). The low percentage of mapped reads is possibly due to the fact that our database contained only the genes that were characterized in KEGG pathway maps. Gene and KO counts were estimated as described in Section 2.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">From the significance of deregulation to networks</head><p>Our goal was to identify significantly differentially expressed maximum-scoring connected subnetworks (MSS) in a global network of interacting KOs. To find such subnetworks, each node (KO) in the global network was assigned a weight that reflected the statistical significance of its deregulation. These weights were calculated using the P-value distribution of KO fold changes obtained by differential expression analysis. The subsequent filtering of KOs with low base mean expression across all samples reduced their numbers in the PD and DC datasets from 8882 and 8527 to 7105 and 5081, respectively. The numbers of KOs up-and downregulated (P &lt; 1) in disease in the PD dataset were, respectively, 3870 and 3235 (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S2A</ref>). In the DC dataset, 2671 KOs were up-and 2410 were downregulated in disease (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S2B</ref>). To transform the P-values into weights, we fitted a beta-uniform mixture (BUM) model to the distribution of P-values. The maximum-likelihood values of the mixture (k) and shape (a) parameters of the BUM models were, respectively, 0.50 and 0.31 for the PD, and 0.48 and 0.54 for the DC dataset. For each dataset, the parameters of the BUM model, the list of Pvalues and a false-discovery rate (FDR) were given as input to the Heinz package (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dittrich et al., 2008</ref>), where KO weights were calculated following Equation (1). Heinz uses the FDR to calculate a significance (P-value) threshold according to which KOs with lower and higher P-values are assigned positive and negative weights, respectively (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>, secondary axis). In the PD dataset, we used a strict FDR ¼ 0.0007 that corresponded to a very low significance threshold P ¼ 10 À5 and constrained the number of positively scoring KOs, which in return limited the size of the resulting MSS, to an interpretable scale (approximately 40 KOs). For allowing a similar number of nodes to be positively scored in the more noisy DC dataset, we used a larger FDR ¼ 0.11 that corresponded to a significance threshold P ¼ 0.003 (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1B</ref>, red line). Both<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1A</ref>and B clearly show the signal (the Beta distribution at low P-values) as well as the noise component (the uniform distribution at higher P-values) in the datasets. For these FDR values, 134 nodes in the PD network (1.9%) and 152 nodes in the DC network (3%) were assigned positive weights, while the remaining nodes attained negative weights.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Significantly deregulated connected subnetworks</head><p>To obtain a global pathway map that covers the inter-pathway connections, we integrated all KEGG pathways into a global KO network of 6642 nodes (KOs) and 35 405 edges (KO interactions, Section 2.4). By taking the overlap between the global network and the KOs identified in the PD and DC datasets, we derived a global disease-specific network for each dataset, each covering more than metaModules identifies key functional subnetworks53% of the KOs in the global network. Furthermore, each disease network included a large connected component that contained at least 77% of the nodes in the network as a whole. Having the nodes of these global disease network annotated with weights from the previous step, we used the Heinz algorithm (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dittrich et al., 2008</ref>) and identified the connected MSS on each network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">Periodontal disease</head><p>The maximum-scoring subnetwork identified in the periodontal disease dataset consisted predominantly of KOs that were upregulated in disease (32 up-versus 7 downregulated in disease, Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S1</ref>), suggesting that key mechanisms involved in disease are mostly due to overexpression of certain functions by the microbiome rather than the lessening of those found in health. The KOs in the subnetwork were members of 48 KEGG pathways in total (a single KO can be a member of multiple pathways). Nonetheless, all KOs upregulated in disease could be covered by the shown regions of six KEGG pathways (<ref type="figure">Fig. 2A</ref>). Among these, parts of the lysine degradation and butanoate, pyruvate, and sulfur metabolisms included in the subnetwork were almost entirely composed of KOs upregulated in disease. A vast part of the periodontal disease subnetwork that was upregulated in disease covered the biochemical reactions that lead to the production of butanoate, the conjugate base of butyric acid, by two different mechanisms. The first mechanism appears to start with the 2-step breakdown of pyruvate to acetoacetyl-CoA in the pyruvate metabolism, where acetoacetyl-CoA is fed into the butanoate metabolism (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S3</ref>). In the butanoate metabolism, four</p><p>KOs in the subnetwork covered the enzymatic steps necessary for the conversion of acetoacetyl-CoA to butanoate (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig.  S4</ref>). The second mechanism was the lysine degradation pathway, where other KOs in the subnetwork (all upregulated in disease) fully covered the 6-step conversion of lysine to butanoate (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S5</ref>). The involvement of butanoate in periodontal disease has been known as an inhibiting agent for human cell growth (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chang et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Levine, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Singer and Buckner, 1981</ref>). Additionally, the subnetwork KOs in the sulfur metabolism covered two of the three metabolic steps for the reduction of sulfate to sulfide. The role of sulfate-reducing bacteria in periodontitis has been previously reported as the production of cytotoxic levels of sulfide that lead to cellular destruction (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Langendijk et al., 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Langendijk et al., , 2000</ref>). Other pathways that were mainly upregulated in disease included arginine, proline, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism. Our results regarding disease-associated butanoate production largely overlap with the findings reported in the original study of the PD dataset (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Jorth et al., 2014</ref>), where the authors describe the involvement of lysine degradation in butanoate production. As an addition to their findings, we report the apparent interplay between the pyruvate and butanoate degradation pathways as a secondary mechanism for butanoate production, as well as the involvement of sulfide as a potential virulence factor in periodontal disease.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2">Dental caries</head><p>In contrast to periodontal disease, the maximum-scoring subnetwork identified in the dental caries dataset was mostly downregulated in disease (18 down-versus 13 upregulated KOs in disease, Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S2</ref>). The health-associated KOs were mainlythe caries dataset denotes the significance (P-value) threshold that separates KOs with positive and negative weights. Note that the black lines display the KO weights and not the BUM model fits to the distributions constituents of the pathways associated with amino acid biosynthesis and pyrimidine, purine and pyruvate metabolism (<ref type="figure">Fig. 2B</ref>). In the pyruvate metabolism, they covered the metabolic path for the breakdown of oxaloacetate to acetaldehyde. In contrast, oxaloacetate is converted to another substance, phosphoenolpyruvate, by the only KO in the pyruvate metabolism that was upregulated in disease (K01596), suggesting a different role for the compound in disease. The second pathway downregulated in disease was the biosynthesis of amino acids. Together with the upregulation of these pathways in health, we attribute the health-associated expression of KOs in the purine and pyrimidine metabolism to bacterial growth and proliferation. This argument might be supported by the fact that, by using a slightly higher false-discovery rate, the dental caries subnetwork could have been extended to include six other KOs (all upregulated in health) from the glycerophospholipid metabolism, the main products of which are the components of bacterial cell membranes required for growth. Earlier studies show that the metabolic activity of caries-promoting bacteria results in low pH conditions that drastically affect the survival of other oral species (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bradshaw et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Harper and Loesche, 1984</ref>). On the other hand, in healthy state, mutual interactions are necessary to obtain energy and maintain growth, for instance for the catabolism of salivary glycoproteins (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dejong and Vanderhoeven, 1987</ref>). The disease-associated parts of the caries subnetwork included 9 KOs from the pathways of phosphotransferase system and fructose and mannose metabolism (<ref type="figure">Fig. 2B</ref>). Perhaps functionally the most interesting of these KOs are the sugar phosphotransferases involved in the beta-glucoside metabolism (K02755, K02756 and K02757). The importance of beta-glucoside metabolism for cariogenic oral bacteria has been put forward by studies showing the inhibitory effect of mutations in the beta-glucoside metabolism genes on biofilm formation, a vital process for the colonization of these bacteria on tooth surfaces (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kiliç et al., 2004</ref>). A secondary set of disease-associated KOs in the caries subnetwork that might be functionally interesting are from the fructose and mannose metabolism. Four of these KOs convert sorbitol to fructose 6-phosphate. Unlike many other oral species, the well-known cariogenic bacteria Streptococcus mutans can metabolize sorbitol and mannitol as a carbon source (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ajdic et al., 2002</ref>) In contrast, the only KO downregulated in disease (K00844) in the same pathway converts fructose to fructose 6phosphate. Within fructose metabolism, this suggests that while in health fructose is the main carbon source, in dental caries sorbitol might be used as an additional source of carbon. We note that the DC dataset in its original study (<ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Peterson et al., 2014</ref>) was not used to perform a differential expression analysis, but rather an overall gene expression analysis of the healthy and diseased samples as a whole. Therefore, to our knowledge, these are the first results obtained from a metatranscriptomic dataset that aim at elucidating the role of functional metabolic modules that are involved in dental caries.<ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.3">Significant subnetworks</head><p>To assess the likelihood of obtaining the MSSs identified in the PD and DC datasets due to chance, we used a resampling procedure. We randomly shuffled the KO weights in the global disease networks, calculated the MSSs in the networks with shuffled weights, and determined the cumulative weight of the identified subnetworks (n ¼ 500). In the PD dataset, none of the 500 shuffled networks resulted in an MSS that outscored the periodontal disease subnetwork. For the DC dataset, only 36 out of 500 MSSs attained cumulative scores that were higher than that of the caries subnetwork. We attribute these 36 random networks to the lower signal content and the higher FDR used in the dental caries dataset. The comparison between the cumulative weights of original subnetworks and those that resulted from resampling strongly indicates that the results reported above are not originating from random effects (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S6</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Contribution of different species to subnetworks</head><p>Previous studies of microbiome-related diseases have demonstrated that the metabolic functions associated with disease or health may be performed by particular taxonomic groups within a microbial community (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Belda-Ferre et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Man et al., 2011</ref>). To determine whether this applies to the functional disease subnetworks we identified in this study, we determined the lists of 10 species that showed the greatest overall increase or decline in disease in the expressions of functions that were found in the subnetworks (Section 2.6).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.1">Periodontal disease</head><p>The KOs in the butanoate metabolism were upregulated by almost all of the top 10 species that showed the largest increase in the expression of periodontal disease subnetwork KOs in disease, including the well-known periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum (<ref type="figure">Fig. 2C</ref>). Previously, only the F. nucleatum species was proposed to be responsible for butanoate production (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Jorth et al., 2014</ref>). Our analysis suggests otherwise; a wider range of organisms seems responsible for the production of butanoate. Note that our reference metagenome database included genes from all species in KEGG, while Jorth et al.</p><p>(2014) used genomes of 60 oral species to construct their reference database, which may explain why we were able to find a wider range of species. Although expressing all other KOs in the butanoate metabolism, P. gingivalis and Odoribacter splanchnicus surprisingly did not express one of the key KOs in the same pathway (K00626, EC 2.3.1.9 in Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S4</ref>). This suggests that in these bacteria, this function is covered by enzymes from other pathways, or that its product (acetoacetyl-CoA) is acquired from the environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.2">Dental caries</head><p>The 10 species that showed the greatest upregulation of the KOs in the dental caries subnetwork in disease included Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus casei, which frequently are associated with dental caries (<ref type="figure">Fig. 2D</ref>). Interestingly, in addition to the wellknown cariogenic species, we observe, as in the periodontal disease dataset, a wider range of species with a similar pathogenic expression profile in the maximum-scoring subnetwork. A contradictory finding in this section is that Streptococcus, Clostridium and Lactobacillus species appear to show an increased expression of adenosine deaminase (K01488) in purine metabolism in the disease state. One of the products of this enzyme is ammonia, the production of which increases the pH in the oral cavity and therefore is generally described as an inhibitory factor on caries development (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Burne et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Koopman et al., 2015</ref>). This result is even more intriguing, considering that the species showing the greatest overall upregulation of the KOs in the caries module in health did not show increase in the expression of adenosine deaminase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Comparsion with other methods</head><p>As there is currently no other method for identifying subnetworks of significantly deregulated KOs in metatranscriptomics datasets, we compared our approach with MetaPath, a method that is developed for solving a similar but fundamentally different biological problem. Unlike metaModules, MetaPath aims to find subnetworks of enzymatic reactions that are enriched or depleted as a whole in a given experimental condition. Since the global metabolic networks natively used by the two methods are different, for consistency, we applied both methods on the MetaPath network (see Section 2.7 for details). The comparison of their results immediately makes it clear that the two methods address distinct biological questions: whereas MetaPath finds subnetworks of fully up-or downregulated KOs, metaModules finds a subnetwork in which the vast majority of KOs is significantly deregulated (Supplementary Figs S7 and S9). The overlap of 7 KOs between the subnetworks calculated by metaModules and MetaPath are parts of the two disease-associated pathways described in Section 3.3: fructose and mannose metabolism and phosphotransferase system (Supplementary Figs S7 and S8). This finding is in line with the above conclusions; both of these pathways were mostly significantly deregulated in a certain phenotype (caries-positive) and therefore were parts of the solution spaces of both methods. In conclusion, these results suggest that the two methods are complementary as they address different questions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Metabolic pathways in microbial communities</head><p>Since microbial communities can communicate and interact by exchanging metabolites (<ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Rath and Dorrestein, 2012</ref>), metabolic pathways and in particular KOs are well-suited to study the gene expression levels in full microbial communities and changes thereof in disease-associated communities. The suitability of our approach within this framework is highlighted by the recovery of essential upand downregulated subnetworks by the analysis of high throughput metatranscriptomic datasets. Within our datasets, we do indeed seem to find hints of species relying on other species within the community, e.g. as a source for metabolites. This means that high throughput sequencing experiments will in fact be one of the most common ways to study such species, as culturing such organisms in the laboratory will be understandably difficult (<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Ling et al., 2015</ref>). Therefore, the computational methodology developed here to study these mechanisms in their natural communities will be important to understand the full mechanisms of microbiome-related diseases. of experimental methods in previous studies. Being able to automatically recover large parts of the known disease biology using single high throughput transcriptomic datasets from full microbial communities is an important step forward for the discovery of currently unknown factors in microbiome-mediated diseases.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig.1.</head><figDesc>Fig. 1.

			<note place="foot">After the reads were mapped to KEGG proteins, gene counts were estimated using a &apos;best-hit&apos; approach by counting the number of times a gene was mapped to a read as the best-matching target. In the case of tied hits with the same E-value, the count for each topscoring gene was incremented. Note that, given the statistical framework used for differential expression analysis is suitable, more sophisticated methods such as HUMAnN (Abubucker et al., 2012), which take into account the alignment quality and gene length differences, can be used to estimate the counts. Differential expression analysis at gene level was performed using the R package DESeq2 v1.6.1 (Love et al., 2014). A multi-factor model was used for the paired samples in the PD dataset, while for the DC dataset an unpaired analysis was performed by using the default processing and analysis steps described in the DESeq2 package vignette. KO counts were estimated by summing the counts of all genes belonging to a given KO. Differential expression analysis at KO level was performed as described for genes. The KOs with very low mean of normalized counts were discarded by the independent filtering option in DESeq2. While this filtering is optional in RNA-Seq analyses that use the raw (and not the adjusted) P-values in their pipeline, its use is recommended in metatranscriptomic datasets where sparse counts may well lead to inaccurate results (Luo et al., 2013). 2.4 Networks We considered two KOs functionally interacting if there was a KEGG relation defined between them in a given KEGG pathway map (e.g. acting on the same compound in two successive reactions, or sharing a direct signaling relationship). We combined these interactions in a single network, removed self-loops and duplicated edges, and obtained a global network of 6642 nodes (KOs) and 35 405 undirected edges (interactions) with a large connected component (5547 nodes and 34 348 edges). The global networks for the PD and DC datasets were obtained by taking the intersection of KOs in the global KEGG network and those retained in the two datasets, and then removing the non-interacting, isolated nodes in the resulting networks, i.e. the nodes from which there is no path to another node in the network. 2.5 Identification of maximum-scoring subnetworks Given metatranscriptomic data from healthy and diseased individuals and an interaction network of KOs, our goal is to identify functional subnetworks of significantly deregulated KOs in microbial communities. The subnetwork identification in metaModules is based on the work by Dittrich et al. (2008). Here, each node in the network is assigned a negative or a positive weight reflecting the statistical significance of its differential expression (P-value), followed by the application of a search algorithm (Heinz) that identifies the optimal maximum-scoring connected subnetworks (MSS) in the network. As described by Pounds and Morris (2003), a P-value distribution of differential expression data can be regarded as a mixture of two distributions that model a signal and a noise component: P-values obtained from the background noise alone will follow a uniform distribution. On the other hand, the signal component, which arises from true differences in expression, follows a Beta(a, 1) distribution. To derive node weights from P-values, we first fitted a beta-uniform mixture model to the distribution of P-values as described in Beisser et al. (2010). Next, the mixture (k) and shape (a) parameters of this model, the list of P-values and a false-discovery rate (FDR) were given as input to the Heinz package to derive the node (KO) weights. The adjusted node score (weight) S of a P-value x is given by: SðxÞ ¼ ða–1ÞðlogðxÞ–logðsðFDR; k; aÞÞÞ (1) where s(FDR, k, a) is the significance threshold corresponding to the specified FDR and the fitted values of k and a, as described in Pounds and Morris (2003). The KOs with P-values lower than this threshold are regarded as part of the signal and are assigned positive weights, while KOs with higher P-values are assumed to constitute the noise and are given negative weights. Note that the directionality of deregulation does not play a role in the calculation of the weights. In other words, the resulting MSSs do not have to be dominantly up-or downregulated in a certain phenotype. However, if needed, a</note>

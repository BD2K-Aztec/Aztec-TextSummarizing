				<p>Motivation: Since database retrieval is a fundamental operation, the measurement of retrieval efficacy is critical to progress in bioinformatics. This article points out some issues with current methods of measuring retrieval efficacy and suggests some improvements. In particular, many studies have used the pooled receiver operating characteristic for n irrelevant records (ROC n) score, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of a &apos;pooled&apos; ROC curve, truncated at n irrelevant records. Unfortunately, the pooled ROC n score does not faithfully reflect actual usage of retrieval algorithms. Additionally, a pooled ROC n score can be very sensitive to retrieval results from as little as a single query. Methods: To replace the pooled ROC n score, we propose the Threshold Average Precision (TAP-k), a measure closely related to the well-known average precision in information retrieval, but reflecting the usage of E-values in bioinformatics. Furthermore, in addition to conditions previously given in the literature, we introduce three new criteria that an ideal measure of retrieval efficacy should satisfy. Results: PSI-BLAST, GLOBAL, HMMER and RPS-BLAST provided examples of using the TAP-k and pooled ROC n scores to evaluate sequence retrieval algorithms. In particular, compelling examples using real data highlight the drawbacks of the pooled ROC n score, showing that it can produce evaluations skewing far from intuitive expectations. In contrast, the TAP-k satisfies most of the criteria desired in an ideal measure of retrieval efficacy.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>In bioinformatics, retrieval from databases is a fundamental operation. Therefore, progress depends on being able to recognize superior retrieval algorithms, so the measurement of retrieval efficacy is critical in bioinformatics.<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Swets (1967)</ref>stated that an ideal * To whom correspondence should be addressed. measure of retrieval efficacy (or more simply, a 'retrieval measure') should satisfy four conditions:</p><p>(1) It should concern itself solely with the effectiveness of separating the relevant from the non-relevant<ref type="bibr">[records]</ref>and not with the efficiency of resource use.</p><p>(2) It should not be dependent on a<ref type="bibr">[user]</ref>threshold, but should measure the potential output of the method.</p><p>(3) It should be a single number.</p><p>(4) It should have absolute significance as a measure of a single method and should readily allow comparisons of different methods to decide which is best.</p><p>To fix our terms, when a user queries a database of R records, a retrieval algorithm typically lists up to R records, ranked by some score S indicating the probability that the corresponding record has relevance to the query. In text retrieval (e.g. Google or PubMed results), retrieval lists do not indicate the scores producing their list orders. In a significant break with the traditions of information retrieval, however, bioinformatics retrieval often explicitly presents an E-value with the score, so users are free to choose an E-value threshold E 0 and then ignore the retrieval list beyond E 0. For concreteness, we discuss only E-values, but the methods in this article apply to any score S. (Note that E-values and the retrieval ranks increase together.) In accord with the motivation behind E-values,<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Wilbur (1992)</ref>modified Swets'<ref type="bibr">Condition (2)</ref>:</p><p>(2 ) It should be characterized by a<ref type="bibr">[user]</ref>threshold, but should reflect the quality of retrieval at every rank down to that threshold.</p><p>Wilbur's modification implicitly respects an overarching principle governing retrieval measures, which we call 'the Principle of Fidelity': a retrieval measure should faithfully reflect the actual usage of the retrieval list. If not, the measure might be 'ideal' in some abstract sense, but would lack a practical meaning. The Principle of Fidelity supports Wilbur's Condition (2 ) in bioinformatics, because an E-value threshold E 0 influences the actual usage of a retrieval algorithm. Since a user rarely examines a retrieval list far beyond the E-value threshold E 0 , any practical measure of database retrieval in bioinformatics should reflect the user's E 0. The rest of this article, therefore, disregards Swets' Condition (2) in favor of Wilbur's Condition (2 ), referring to the result as the 'Swets–Wilbur Conditions'.Page: 1709 1708–1713</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TAP-k: a measure of retrieval designed for bioinformatics</head><p>In addition to the Swets–Wilbur Conditions, the Principle of Fidelity suggests that an ideal retrieval measure should satisfy additional conditions. Accordingly, we introduce the following conditions:</p><p>(5) It should be robust against results representing a small proportion of possible user queries.</p><p>(6) When two disjoint sets of queries are considered, its value for the union of the two sets should lie between its values for the two sets of queries.</p><p>(7) It should reflect the choice of threshold; in particular, it should eventually decrease as the threshold increases to include the entire retrieval list.</p><p>Condition (5) reflects the fact that not many users are likely to query with the proportionally small subset, so the subset should not greatly influence conclusions about retrieval efficacy. Condition (6) says that when combined, two disjoint sets of retrieval results should not suggest better (or worse) efficacy than either set individually. Condition (7) reflects the fact that presumably, an appropriate E-value threshold E 0 has practical utility: if users prefer to examine the entire retrieval list, they have no use for an E-value threshold. The receiver operating characteristic for n irrelevant records (ROC n ) score (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gribskov and Robinson, 1996</ref>) described in Section 2 is often used as a retrieval measure in bioinformatics. In fact, the 'pooled ROC n score' (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Schaffer et al., 1999</ref>) (also described in Section 2) is probably the most popular summary retrieval measure over several different queries. However, the Principle of Fidelity casts immediate suspicion on the pooled ROC n score as a retrieval measure. Users do not examine the pooled retrieval list aggregated from lists for individual queries: users see the individual retrieval lists one at a time. Section 3 shows that the pooled ROC n score does not always satisfy Condition (5) or (6). Moreover, it always fails to satisfy Condition (7). To replace the pooled ROC n score, we therefore propose as a measure of retrieval the Threshold Average Precision at a median of k errors per query (EPQ) (abbreviated and pronounced 'TAP-k'). The TAP-k summarizes features of the precision–recall (PR) curve (described in Section 2). PR curves are popular in general information retrieval and already have found some favor in bioinformatics (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chen, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Jones et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Krishnamurthy et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Raychaudhuri et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Wass and Sternberg, 2008</ref>). To exemplify the PR curve and TAP-k, Section 3 presents several examples of actual database retrieval, using the programs PSIBLAST (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Schaffer et al., 2001</ref>), GLOBAL (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kann et al., 2007</ref>), HMMER (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Eddy, 1998</ref>) and RPS-BLAST (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Schaffer et al., 1999</ref>). The section shows that unlike the TAP-k, the pooled ROC n score can produce evaluations so misleading as to be completely contrary to common sense (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chen, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hand, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Sierk and Pearson, 2004</ref>). Finally, Section 4 summarizes the implications of our results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Databases and query sets</head><p>We used two distinct databases in this work (see Supplementary Material). First, Gonzalez and Pearson (2010) constructed DB_344_Pfam, 344 protein families from the Pfam database (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Finn et al., 2008</ref>). As sample queries for DB_344_Pfam, they provided 50 randomly selected families, each with a 'query A', from a deserted part of each family's phylogenetic tree; and a 'query B', from a heavily populated part. Gonzalez and Pearson considered as 'relevant' only sequences in the same domain family or clan as the query. Second,<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kann et al. (2007)</ref>provided DB_331_CDD, the positionspecific scoring matrices (PSSMs) corresponding to 331 multiple sequence alignments from the NCBI Conserved Domain Database (CDD;<ref type="bibr">MarchlerBauer et al., 2007</ref>). As sample queries for DB_331_CDD, they provided DB_8920_PDB<ref type="bibr">[</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Berman et al., 2007</ref>). Kann et al. considered as 'relevant' only to those sequences in DB_8920_PDB that had at least 80% overlap with a representative in DB_331_CDD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Retrieval programs</head><p>Retrieval with PSI-BLAST (version 2.2.21) provided our anecdotal examples. We performed five PSI-BLAST iterations on NCBI's NR database with an E-value threshold of 0.005, using the final PSSM to retrieve sequences from DB_344_Pfam. Estimates of retrieval efficacy reflected solely the final retrieval from DB_344_Pfam, not the previous iterations on the NR database. Additionally, we calculated retrieval results for GLOBAL, HMMER and RPS-BLAST with the DB_8920_PDB queries searching in the DB_331_CDD. We utilized two variants of HMMER: HMMER_semi-global and HMMER_local (HMMER in 'global' and 'local' modes, respectively). The settings for HMMER, along with their rationale, have been specified elsewhere (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kann et al., 2007</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Retrieval measures</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">The ROC n curve and score</head><p>Given a particular query, assume every database record is either relevant or irrelevant to the query. [The standard ROC terminology refers to 'true positives' and 'false positives', but in information retrieval, the terms 'relevant' and 'irrelevant' are pertinent. Unlike some authors (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hand, 2009</ref>), we view information retrieval as a problem in ranking, not a problem in<ref type="bibr">classification.]</ref>Let the total number of irrelevant records be F. In response to a query, a retrieval algorithm produces a ranked retrieval list of all records in the database. Number each irrelevant record in the database 1,2, ... ,f , ... ,F, according to its order in the retrieval ranking. The 'ROC curve' plots the fraction of relevant records preceding the f-th irrelevant record against the fraction f /F. The 'ROC score' is the area under the ROC curve, abbreviated 'AUC' (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Swets, 1988</ref>). The ROC score is the probability that a random relevant record is ranked before a random irrelevant record (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bamber, 1975</ref>). By analogy to the ROC curve, the 'ROC n curve' is the ROC curve truncated after the first n irrelevant records, with the ROC n score being the area under the ROC n curve divided by n/F. An 'ideal retrieval' ranks all relevant records before any irrelevant record. The normalization by n/F ensures that ideal retrieval receives the maximum ROC n score of 1.0. For the ROC n , a threshold of n = 50 irrelevant records seems accepted practice (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gribskov and Robinson, 1996</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">The pooled ROC n score</head><p>To calculate the pooled ROC n score, merge the retrieval lists for all sample queries into a 'pooled retrieval list', and sort the pooled list on the E-value. Then, calculate the ROC n score for the pooled list, as though it were a single retrieval list.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3">The PR curve and the average precision</head><p>PR curves and average precision (AP) often quantify retrieval efficacy in general information retrieval. To calculate the AP (see Supplementary Material), fix the retrieval algorithm A and consider a particular query q to a fixed database. Let the database contain T (q) records relevant to the queryq, and let them be ranked t 1 &lt; ... &lt; t T (q) in the retrieval list for algorithm A. (Thus, for ideal retrieval, t i = i for i = 1, ... ,T (q).) Let p(j) denote 'precision', defined as the fraction j/t j of relevant records in the retrieval list up to and including the j-th relevant record. (The precision is, therefore, one minus the false discovery rate, i.e.it is a true positive rate.) Also, let r(j) denote 'recall', the fraction j/T (q) of relevant records up to and including the j-th relevant record. The PR curve plots p(j) against r(j) (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.4">The TAP-k We</head><p>now design a retrieval measure reflecting the usage of E-values in bioinformatics. Let E 0 be an arbitrary E-value threshold. For the query q, define j(E 0 ) to be the number of relevant records in the retrieval list with an E-value less than or equal to the threshold E 0. Consider the 'terminal pre-threshold irrelevant records' (TPIRs), the irrelevant records retrieved after the j(E 0 )-th relevant record but having an E-value less than or equal to E 0 (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 2</ref>). Call the last record with an E-value less than or equal to E 0 the 'sentinel' record. Regardless of whether or not the sentinel is relevant, it is associated with a precision p(E 0 ), where p(E 0 ) is the fraction of records preceding or including the sentinel that are relevant. (If there are no records before the E-value threshold E 0 , define p(E 0 ) = 0.) The following measure captures the effect of both post-threshold relevant records and TPIRs:</p><formula>p(E 0 ;q) = 1 T (q)+1 ⎡ ⎣ j(E 0 ) m=1 p(m)+p(E 0 ) ⎤ ⎦ (1)</formula><p>To summarize Equation (1), it assigns the post-threshold relevant records a precision of 0, considers the precision at the sentinel record, and then averages the precision of the pre-threshold relevant, sentinel and postthreshold relevant records. (If j(E 0 ) = 0, there are no relevant records before the threshold, and we adopt the standard convention that empty sums equal 0, so Equation (1) yields the value 0.) To measure the overall retrieval efficacy for several sample queries, the simplest and most intuitive aggregate measure is p(E 0 ), the average of the TAP, p(E 0 ;q), over all queries (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chen, 2003</ref>). Query averages are easy to interpret, and if usage favors certain types of queries, the average can be weighted, e.g. linearly or quadratically with the number of proteins in a family (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Green and Brenner, 2002</ref>). Now, we determine an E-value threshold E 0 mirroring a user's tolerance for retrieval errors. Assume (as the ROC n score does) that a user tolerates about k EPQ, k being some arbitrary integer. Section 3, e.g. gives k = 20 as an arbitrary but not unreasonable estimate of a (maximum) tolerable EPQ. Determine the smallest E-value E k (A) corresponding to a median number of k EPQ over all queries q for a given algorithm A. Thus, for any E-value threshold larger than E k (A), at least 50% of the queries have at least k errors. (Section 3 explains why the median EPQ is preferable to the mean EPQ.) Each algorithm's E-value predicts the actual number of EPQ with varying accuracy, so the threshold E k (A) depends on the algorithm A. With the same median k EPQ, all algorithms have the same specificity. With their specificities fixed at the same value, their sensitivities are on an equal footing, and therefore comparable. In summary, our measure of overall retrieval efficacy is p k = p k (A), the (query-averaged) TAP-k for a median k EPQ (the 'TAP-k'), i.e. it is the average over all queries of Equation (1) with E 0 = E k (A).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Software availability</head><p>We implemented Equation (1) in a Perl script and provided a web interface to calculate the TAP-k for a set of retrieval lists. Both are easy to use, return results quickly, and are freely available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Spouge/html.ncbi/tap/.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RESULTS</head><p>In this section, we compare the TAP-k to the pooled ROC n score. First, we examine the effect of using the median EPQ versus using the mean EPQ. Next, we show how a single query can skew the pooled ROC n score. Then, we present an example of calculating the E-value threshold for k median EPQ. Finally, we show how varying the E-value threshold affects the TAP-k.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Median EPQ versus mean EPQ</head><p>To illustrate the compelling reasons why the mean EPQ is inferior to the median EPQ when analyzing database retrieval, consider a PSI-BLAST retrieval from DB_344_Pfam.<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>displays a boxand-whisker plot of the distribution over queries of the EPQ against E-value. At an E-value of 0.01, only about 10% of queries produce any retrieval errors at all (data not shown), although the mean EPQ is already about 2. Thus, the mean EPQ of 2 reflects a definite minority of the queries that users encounter. As an extreme hypothetical example, if a single query out of 1 × 10 6 possible queries produced 2 × 10 6 false positives, and all other queries had perfect retrieval, the mean EPQ would still be 2.0, although few users indeed would encounter any retrieval errors. In contrast, the median EPQ is 0.0, accurately representing 99.9999% of the queries. The Principle of Fidelity, therefore, favors the median EPQ over the mean EPQ, because it reflects a user's typical experience more closely.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">The pooled ROC n</head><p>To illustrate the counter-intuitive behavior of the pooled ROC n score when measuring retrieval efficacy over several queries, consider<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4a</ref>. It displays ROC 50 curves corresponding to three retrieval lists from the Pfam homoserine dehydrogenase family, two for the single queries A and B of the homoserine dehydrogenase family in Pfam, and one for the corresponding pooled retrieval list for A and B together. The retrieval list for query A has a ROC 50 score of 0.971, close to ideal retrieval, ranking all but 14 out of the 481 relevant records before any irrelevant record. On the other hand, the retrieval list for query B has a ROC 50 score of 0.195, because it ranks only 94 of the 481 relevant records ahead of the corresponding irrelevant records. All initial n = 50 irrelevant records in the retrieval list of query B have lower E-values than any relevant records in the retrieval list for query A, with the 50-th record for query B having an E-value of 1 × 10 −134. Since query B has small E-values that appear early in its retrieval, it dominates the values of the pooled ROC 50. Because pooling the two queries doubles the number of relevant records, the pooled ROC n score is only 0.098, half the minimum ROC n of the two queries. We attempted to remedy the counter-intuitive behavior of the ROC n score by truncating the retrieval lists for queries A and B at the E-value threshold E 20 (PSI-BLAST) (data not shown). For every n ≤ 203, however, the pooled ROC n curve still places an exaggerated emphasis on query B and its ineffective retrieval.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">The calculation of the threshold E k ( A)</head><p>To illustrate the mechanics of determining the threshold<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4b</ref>illustrates the PR curves for the Pfam homoserine dehydrogenase family, up to the recall corresponding to the threshold E-value E 20 (PSI-BLAST) = 8.1, where PSI-BLAST yields 20 median EPQ over all queries for DB_344_Pfam. On one hand, query A yields nearly ideal retrieval, and there is little difference between the ROC n score and the TAP-k. On the other hand, query B yields precision 1.0 until a recall of about 0.2, when the precision drops dramatically. It then rises and falls again before the recall near 1 corresponding to E 20 (PSI-BLAST) = 8.1. Although the curve for query B indicates that its retrieval is inferior to the retrieval for Page: 1712 1708–1713query A, the average of the curves for queries A and B lies between the individual curves, as one expects intuitively. Using the threshold E k (A) for A = {GLOBAL, HMMER_semiglobal, HMMER_local, RPS-BLAST}, we calculated the (queryaveraged) TAP-k for each algorithm's retrieval from DB_331_CDD (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). (On one hand, because the number of errors for a single query is unbounded, the median is better than the mean as a summary statistic for determining a threshold E-value; on the other hand, the TAP-k for each query is bounded, so the mean is a suitable summary statistic for the TAP-k over all queries.) Additionally, we looked at the average TAP versus E-value (<ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>), because the TAP may peak as the EPQ increases. In contrast, all ROC curves increase (or at least remain constant) with increasing EPQ. In<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>, each algorithm A has a peak E-value, E 0 *(A), between 0.12 and 1.03 (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>).</p></div>

In fact, many other researchers have pointed out the superiority of PR curves over ROC curves in information retrieval.<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Fawcett (2006)</ref>advises that, 'PR graphs are commonly used where " the number of<ref type="bibr">[irrelevant records]</ref>is many orders of magnitude greater than [the number of relevant records] " ', the common case for database retrieval and most of bioinformatics. Likewise, Liu and Shriberg (2007) suggest that for 'an imbalanced dataset, PR curves generally provide better visualization than do ROC curves, for viewing differences among different algorithms.' Similarly, Davis and Goadrich (2006) warn that 'with highly skewed datasets, PR curves give a more informative picture of an algorithm's performance'and that, 'by comparing false positives to true positives rather than true negatives,<ref type="bibr">[precision]</ref>captures the effect of the large number of negative examples on the algorithm's performance.'<ref type="bibr">Finally, Landgrebe et al. (2006)</ref>argue that ROC analysis effectively ignores the 'minority class' of relevant records. Several bioinformatics studies have relied on ROC analysis as their figure of merit for automatic improvement of database retrieval algorithms. As a figure of merit, however, the pooled ROC n score suffers from defects so obvious that other bioinformatics studies (wisely, in our opinion) have gone so far as to defend conclusions drawn from the pooled ROC n score by checking individual retrieval lists (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Sierk and Pearson, 2004</ref>). Clearly, if the defects of the pooled ROC n score require human intervention, it is inadequate to the task of automated improvement of retrieval algorithms. To provide explicit logical foundations for the discussion about the inadequacies of retrieval measures, this article also articulated a Principle of Fidelity: a retrieval measure should faithfully reflect the actual usage of the retrieval list. In harmony with the Principle of Fidelity, we suggested adding Conditions (5)–(7) to the Swets–Wilbur Conditions for an ideal retrieval measure. The Section 3 demonstrates that the pooled ROC n can violate Conditions (5) and (6). Condition (6) is common sense, so its failure in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4</ref>is particularly disturbing. On the other hand, since the TAP-k is an average over all queries, Conditions (5) and (6) both follow as rigorous mathematical truths. Moreover, consideration of the geometry of a ROC curve shows that the ROC n always increases with the EPQ (or equivalently, with the E-value threshold), in violation of Condition (7). On the other hand, the TAP-k sometimes does satisfy Condition (7):<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>shows its eventual decrease against an increasing E-value threshold E 0. Interestingly, the peak values in<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>occur at values of E 0 *(A) not entirely outside acceptable ranges of the E-value thresholds for the corresponding algorithms, perhaps leading to the hope that even the selection of threshold E-values E 0 might be automated. Unfortunately, the Supplementary Material gives an example of retrieval lists where the TAP-k increases monotonically with the E-value threshold. Although the TAP-k has many properties desirable to optimizing retrieval algorithms automatically, it is currently unable to serve as a basis for automated determination of a best E-value threshold E 0 *(A). For concreteness, this article has discussed E-values, but in fact it is pertinent to any score S, not just to E-values. The E-value is really just a type of score that retains theoretical meaning across different queries as a surrogate for a record's probability of relevance. Like other scores, however, E-values do not predict the relevancy of records with complete accuracy, and the accuracy depends very much on the application (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Brenner et al., 1998</ref>). Thus, if a particular algorithm A produces a retrieval list, a user willing to tolerate about a median k EPQ must apparently learn the corresponding</p><formula>E-value threshold E 0 = E k (A</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TAP-k: a measure of retrieval designed for bioinformatics</head><p>EPQ can and should be adapted to fit individual needs, e.g. k can be chosen differently, query-averages can be weighted, trimmed means or a different percentile EPQ from the median for k can be used, etc. The ROC n also depends implicitly on the algorithm A, because it fixes the total number n of errors across all queries. Thus, where the TAP-k fixes the median EPQ, the ROC n fixes the mean EPQ. In general (particularly for unbounded random variables), the mean can be much more misleading as a measure of central tendency than the median. In particular, if it produces many errors, even a single query could increase the mean EPQ arbitrarily.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figures 3  and 4</ref>reinforce the superiority of choosing the median EPQ in the TAP-k, by showing that a single query can dominate the pooled ROC n score. By extension, coverage versus EPQ plots (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Brenner et al., 1998</ref>) could reflect typical user experience more closely by plotting coverage against median EPQ, rather than mean EPQ.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4</ref>illustrates the same retrieval results for both the pooled ROC n score and a TAP-k. The pooled ROC n score and the TAP-k agree (0.9709 versus 0.9708, respectively) for query A, but differ for query B (0.1954 and 0.5214, respectively). The pooled ROC n score is 0.098, whereas the TAP-k is 0.745. Thus, besides giving some numerical comparison of the pooled ROC n and TAP-k,<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4</ref>illustrates that the TAP-k faithfully represents the relative contribution of 'ill-behaved' queries to a summary measure of retrieval over all queries. In general, we expect that studies would usually draw the same conclusions about relative retrieval efficacy of different algorithms, regardless of whether they used the pooled ROC n score or the TAP-k (although the TAP-k enforces realistic E-value thresholds by exposing its threshold E 0 = E k (A) explicitly). Davis and<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Goadrich (2006)</ref>noted similar expectations between AP and ROC scores. In cases of striking discordance, however, this article presents compelling arguments that the TAP-k is more likely than the pooled ROC n score to accord with intuitive expectations, and that its use will make measurements of retrieval efficacy reflect actual user experience more faithfully. Most importantly, unlike the pooled ROC n , the TAP-k always satisfies Conditions (5) and (6) for an ideal retrieval measure, so it can provide a suitable figure of merit when automating the evaluation of retrieval algorithms.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><figDesc>[09:46 25/6/2010 Bioinformatics-btq270.tex]</figDesc></figure>

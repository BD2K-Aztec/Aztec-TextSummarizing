			<abstract>
				<p>ChIP-Seq data are a new challenge for motif discovery. Such a data typically consists of thousands of DNA segments with base-specific coverage values. We present a new version of our DNA motif discovery software ChIPMunk adapted for ChIP-Seq data. ChIPMunk is an iterative algorithm that combines greedy optimization with bootstrapping and uses coverage profiles as motif positional preferences. ChIPMunk does not require truncation of long DNA segments and it is practical for processing up to tens of thousands of data sequences. Comparison with traditional (MEME) or ChIP-Seq-oriented (HMS) motif discovery tools shows that ChIPMunk identifies the correct motifs with the same or better quality but works dramatically faster.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>ChIP-Seq (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Valouev et al., 2008</ref>) is an efficient technology for the identification of DNA sites of a specific protein binding. Being coupled with peak finding algorithms (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Fejes et al., 2008</ref>), it yields a set of DNA segments with each sequence position having a weight reflecting how often DNA nearby was cross-linked with the protein of interest during ChIP stage (the so-called peaks). There can be tens of thousands of DNA segment, some longer than 1000 bp. Classic tools like Weeder (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Pavesi et al., 2001</ref>), Gibbs Sampler (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Lawrence et al., 1993</ref>) or MEME (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bailey et al., 2009</ref>) were tested for motif discovery in ChIP-Seq segments, but proved to be inefficient for the whole amount of data. Therefore, a fraction of top DNA segments was usually taken (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Chen et al., 2008</ref>) or/and the segments were truncated around the peak maxima (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ji et al., 2008</ref>). Tools like cERMIT (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Georgiev et al., 2010</ref>) and HMS (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Hu et al., 2010</ref>) have been developed for motif discovery from ChIP-Seq data. In this note, we present a motif discovery algorithm that can extract the single optimal motif from large datasets like ChIP-Seq without any preprocessing, while taking into account the peak shape. * To whom correspondence should be addressed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">METHODS</head><p>The basic ChIPMunk implementation (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Kulakovskiy and Makeev, 2009</ref>, see also the Supplementary text section 1, STS1) was extended with three features, necessary for motif discovery from ChIP-Seq data: accounting for the background nucleotide composition (via KDIC concept), zero-or-oneoccurrence-per-sequence (ZOOPS) mode and positional profiles in the initial data (necessary to consider the base coverage in ChIP-Seq data).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">KDIC concept</head><p>The basic version of the ChIPMunk algorithm searches for the motif with the highest discrete information content (DIC) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Kulakovskiy et al., 2009</ref>). DIC does not take into account the background nucleotide composition. To allow for the background, we use the discrete analog of Kullback–Leibler divergence (Kullback DIC, KDIC) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kullback and Leibler, 1951</ref>):</p><formula>KDIC = DIC− w j=1 α∈{A,C,G,T } x α,j logq α</formula><p>where x α,j are elements of the position count matrix (i.e. letter counts), w is the motif length and q α are the background nucleotide probabilities. Please refer to the STS 2 for the mathematical details related to KDIC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">ZOOPS mode</head><p>ChIPMunk searches for the gapless multiple local alignment that has the maximum KDIC value. Then a positional weight matrix (PWM) is constructed, and all the aligned words are sorted by their PWM scores. They are classified into 'the signal' and 'the noise' sublists. To find the boundary word we construct a series of PWMs, made from top 1, 2, … , n words. The idea is that for 'the signal' the score of n-th word calculated with the n-th PWM should be visibly greater than that calculated with N-th PWM (where N is the total words count). See STS 3 for details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Positional profiles</head><p>There are two types of weights assigned to the initial sequence data. Sequences are weighted as a whole; also the weights are assigned to the each sequence position forming the sequence profiles. The source of all weights is the peak shape data. A weight W i for the i-th sequence is its normalized maximal peak value; by normalization the sum of W i over all i is equal to the total number of sequences. The sequence profiles are normalized to make them fit in<ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr">1]</ref>interval. PWM optimization includes two alternating steps: (i) the alignment is rebuilt from words with maximal PWM scores in each data sequence and (ii) the PWM is rebuilt from new motif occurrences. PWM scores for putative hits are weighted from sequences profiles:<ref type="bibr">[j]</ref>,j ·profile<ref type="bibr">[j]</ref>where w is the word length and S word<ref type="bibr">[j]</ref>,j , is the PWM element for the j-th letter in the word. Thus, the positions with a larger profile values contribute morePage: 2623 2622–2623</p><formula>score PWM,word = w j=1 S word</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Motif discovery in ChIP-Seq data</head><p>(either positively or negatively) into the PWM score. Then, the positional count weights x α,j for letter α at motif position j are calculated: α ∈ {A,C,G,T } :</p><formula>x α,j = i W i ·profile i [j]·δ α,word i [j] α = N : x N,j = i W i · 1−profile i [j] ∀j : α∈{A,C,G,T ,N} x α,j = i W i δ a,b = if a = b then 1 if a = b then 0</formula><p>Here profile i<ref type="bibr">[j]</ref>is the value of profile of sequence i at position j, and N denotes 'unknown nucleotide' letter. After collecting the data from all words, x N,j values are uniformly split between x α, j (α ∈ A, C, G, T ) so the total sum is equal to the number of words. The convergence depends on the data. If high profile regions cannot be aligned or their composition is similar to the background, different motifs can have very close KDIC values, rendering the convergence poor. Yet, for the real ChIP-Seq data, convergence improves after profile smoothing by substituting the profile values for their maxima within a sliding window with the length equal to the motif length.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RESULTS</head><p>We took three ChIP-Seq datasets: NRSF (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Johnson et al., 2007</ref>), GABP (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Valouev et al., 2008</ref>) and EWS-FLI1 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Guillon et al., 2009</ref>). We used FindPeaks (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Fejes et al., 2008</ref>) to obtain enriched regions (the peaks). Segments with strict GGAA-type repeats were excluded from the EWS-FLI1 dataset. Motif lengths were fixed at 21, 12 and 11 for NRSF, GABP and EWS-FLI1, respectively. Top 100 (NRSF, GABP) and top 500 (EWS-FLI1) peaks were taken to test several motif discovery tools, including MEME (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bailey et al., 2009</ref>), SeSiMCMC (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Favorov et al., 2005</ref>) and HMS, the novel ChIP-Seq-oriented Gibbs sampler (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Hu et al., 2010</ref>). We used sets of segments that were truncated from 10% to 100% of the peak lengths and were centered at the peak maxima. The fraction of peaks truncated to 10% of initial length centered at the peak maximum with motif hits having scores greater than the mean + 3 SD of score distribution over all w-mers was used as the measure of motif quality. We assessed the time efficiency of motif discovery and the resulting quality of motifs identified from 500 EWS-FLI1 peaks (<ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>). For short segments covering only 10% of the peaks, all the tested tools performed equally well. When the segment length was increased MEME and SeSiMCMC, that did not take the peak shape into account, identified incorrect motifs. In contrast, ChIPMunk (in peak mode) always identified the correct motif. In the mode that did not take peak shapes into account, ChIPMunk failed to identify the correct motif in longer segments. Nevertheless, in both modes, ChIPMunk clearly outperformed HMS that took into account peak shapes, both in speed and quality. For NRSF and GABP, the correct motifs were extracted by the all tools in a wider range of sequence lengths, which probably indicates better data quality (see the STS 4). All in all, here we presented an extended version of our motif discovery tool ChIPMunk that allows using information from strong but also from weaker sites (see STS 10). ChIPMunk is reasonably fast and practically can process datasets of thousands of sequences (see the STS 8) even on a personal computer, taking advantage of the modern multi-core processors.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>[14:</head><figDesc>46 29/9/2010 Bioinformatics-btq488.tex]</figDesc></figure>

				<p>Motivation: Large amounts of biological network data exist for many species. Analogous to sequence comparison, network comparison aims to provide biological insight. Graphlet-based methods are proving to be useful in this respect. Recently some doubt has arisen concerning the applicability of graphlet-based measures to low edge density networks—in particular that the methods are &apos;unstable&apos;—and further that no existing network model matches the structure found in real biological networks. Results: We demonstrate that it is the model networks themselves that are &apos;unstable&apos; at low edge density and that graphlet-based measures correctly reflect this instability. Furthermore, while model network topology is unstable at low edge density, biological network topology is stable. In particular, one must distinguish between average density and local density. While model networks of low average edge densities also have low local edge density, that is not the case with protein– protein interaction (PPI) networks: real PPI networks have low average edge density, but high local edge densities, and hence, they (and thus graphlet-based measures) are stable on these networks. Finally, we use a recently devised non-parametric statistical test to demonstrate that PPI networks of many species are well-fit by several models not previously tested. In addition, we model several viral PPI networks for the first time and demonstrate an exceptionally good fit between the data and theoretical models. Contact:</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Networks are used to represent relationships in molecular biology, such as those between genes in gene regulatory networks and proteins in protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks. A PPI network models the physical bindings between types of proteins in a cell, where a node represents a type of protein and an undirected edge exists between two nodes if the corresponding two proteins can physically bind to each other. The network of all such interactions in a species has been dubbed the interactome, and understanding its structure is an integral step towards understanding cellular systems. Recent advances in the experimental determination of PPI networks, such as yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening (<ref type="bibr">Arabidopsis Interactome Mapping Consortium, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ito et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Rual et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Simonis, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Stelzl et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Uetz et al., 2000</ref>) and mass spectrometry (MS) of purified complexes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gavin et al., 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gavin et al., , 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Krogan et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Rigaut et al., 1999</ref>) have provided an abundance of network data. As these PPI networks are large and complex, it is necessary to develop efficient and biologically meaningful algorithms for their analysis. Because exactly solving many graph analysis problems is computationally intractable, heuristic and approximate methods must be devised. Systematic measures of structure (also called topology) of large networks based on graphlets (small induced subgraphs of large networks), have been introduced (<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">PrzˇuljPrzˇulj, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">PrzˇuljPrzˇulj et al., 2004</ref>). One is based on comparing graphlet frequencies between two networks and is termed relative graphlet frequency (RGF) distance (<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">PrzˇuljPrzˇulj et al., 2004</ref>). The other is based on comparing graphlet degree distributions (GDDs) between two networks and the agreement in GDDs of two networks is measured (<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">PrzˇuljPrzˇulj, 2007</ref>). Both allow quantification of similarity between the topology of two data networks (e.g. between two species), or comparison of a data network with a theoretically derived model network. Fourteen PPI networks of eukaryotic organisms were compared with four different random network models and the fit between the PPI and model networks has been assessed (<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">PrzˇuljPrzˇulj, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">PrzˇuljPrzˇulj et al., 2004</ref>). The use of graphlet-based measures for network comparison has been questioned (<ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Rito et al., 2010</ref>) owing to the measures being 'unstable' in regions of low edge density. Empirical distributions of these scores were calculated and a novel non-parametric test for assessing the statistical significance of the fit between real PPI networks and theoretical models was introduced. The study found that none of the PPI networks of yeast and human that were considered were well-fit by the three theoretical models that were tested. After a discussion of methods, this article is designed to lead the reader through the following observations. First, that RGF distance and GDD agreement (GDDA) are not unstable measures for low edge density networks, but instead that they correctly detect the statistically high variance in network structure that is present in low-density model networks. Second, that this high variability [described as 'instability' by<ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Rito et al. (2010)</ref>] is present in low-density model networks, but neither in real PPI networks nor in the model networks needed to correctly represent them. Third, that current PPI networks are denser than those studied by<ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Rito et al. (2010)</ref>and are well outside the highly variable low-density region. Fourth, that the highly variable region shrinks with increasing network size and is of negligible *To whom correspondence should be addressed. ß The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Graphs and graphlets</head><p>A network or graph GðV, EÞ consists of a set V of n nodes and a set E V Â V of m edges connecting them. Because the maximum number of edges is n 2 ¼ nðn À 1Þ=2, we define the edge density of G as m . n 2 .</p><p>The number of edges touching a node is called its degree; the node at the other end of an edge is called a neighbour. The degree distribution of G, DD G , is defined by DD G ðkÞ, which is the number of nodes in G having degree k. A subgraph of G is a graph whose nodes and edges belong to G. A subgraph S of graph G is induced if S contains all edges that appear in G over the same subset of nodes. A graphlet is a small, connected and induced subgraph of a larger network (<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">PrzˇuljPrzˇulj et al., 2004</ref>).<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>depicts all 29 of the possible graphlets that have 2, 3, 4 and 5 nodes.

Also, they have been used to align PPI networks of different species and transfer annotation to unannotated parts of these networks, as well as to reconstruct phylogeny from network alignment scores (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kuchaiev et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kuchaiev and PrzˇuljPrzˇulj, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Milenkovicét al., 2010a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Memisěvicánd PrzˇuljPrzˇulj, 2012</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Random network models</head><p>We briefly review the random network models discussed in this article. An Erdo¨s–Re´nyi (ER) random graph (Erdo¨sErdo¨s and Re´nyi<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Re´nyi, 1959</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Re´nyi, , 1960</ref>) is generated by fixing the number of nodes n in the network, and adding edges uniformly at random until a given density is reached. An ER-DD model is an ER model in which we force the degree distribution to be the same as that of a data network. Scale-free (SF) networks are those in which the degree distribution follows a power law (Baraba´si<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baraba´si and Albert, 1999</ref>). SF-GD networks are scale-free networks based on a gene duplication model (<ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Vaz´quezVaz´quez et al., 2003</ref>). If the degree distribution is the same as the data and the data are SF, we get a special case of an ER-DD model called random SF (SF-RND). A geometric graph (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Penrose, 2003</ref>) is one in which each node in the network represents a point in space and nodes are joined if their corresponding points are closer than some fixed global constant r. In this article, the geometric random networks (GEO) that we generate have their points distributed uniformly at random in Euclidean space. GEO-GD graphs are geometric graphs in which the points are distributed according to a gene duplication model (<ref type="bibr" target="#b30">PrzˇuljPrzˇulj et al., 2010</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">GDD agreement</head><p>The notion of the degree has been generalized to graphlet degree (PrzˇuljPrzˇulj, 2007). In particular, the standard degree of a node u counts how many edges it touches; in turn, the graphlet degree of u is a vector of 73 integers counting how many times u is centered on each of the automorphism orbits depicted in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. The degree distribution over degrees k of a graph is a distribution of how many nodes have degree k, i.e. touch k edges; in turn, a GDD is an analogous distribution for an automorphism orbit, e.g. the GDD corresponding to orbit 3 in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>measures how many nodes touch k triangles for each value of k. Hence, there are 73 GDDs for graphlets with up to five nodes; the first one of them is the degree distribution. More specifically, let G be a given graph. For each of the 73 automorphism orbits j shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, we denote by d j G ðkÞ the number of nodes in G that are touched k times by a corresponding graphlet at its orbit j. Because a dense graph tends to have a large graphlet degree for large values of k, we first downweight the graphlet degree by 1=k and then normalize, giving the normalized graphlet degree for automorphism orbit j,</p><formula>N j G ðkÞ ¼ d j G ðkÞ=k P 1 l¼1 d j G ðlÞ=l ð1Þ</formula><p>For a particular automorphism orbit j, we can compare the orbit j degree distributions of two networks G and H by treating the normalized degree for orbit j as a vector in degree space (that has dimension equal to the largest degree). We compute the Euclidean distance between these two vectors as</p><formula>D j ðG, HÞ ¼ 1 ffiffi ffi 2 p X 1 k¼1 ½N j G ðkÞ À N j H ðkÞ 2 ! 1 2 ð2Þ</formula><p>where the 1= ffiffi ffi 2 p is a normalization constant that ensures the distance is always51 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Przulj, 2010</ref>). Finally, we subtract each distance from 1 to get an 'agreement' instead of a distance, and sum over all the 73 values of j to get the GDDA GDDAðG, HÞ ¼ 1 73</p><formula>X 72 j¼0 ð1 À D j ðG, HÞÞ ð3Þ</formula><p>If two networks G and H have a GDDA close to 1, then G and H have similar topology in the sense that their GDDs, scaled appropriately to their network size, are statistically similar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>3.1 GDDA is sensitive, not unstable A concern that 'GDDA has a pronounced dependency on the number of edges and vertices of the networks being considered' and that the 'GDDA score is not stable in the region of graph density relevant to current PPI networks' has been expressed (<ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Rito et al., 2010</ref>).<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref>illustrates the point: it depicts the dependency of GDDA on edge density when comparing two model networks with each other. The abrupt drop and raggedness of the GDDA curve at low densities is what was referred to as 'unstable GDDA'. It is crucial to distinguish between a measure being unstable, versus a measure that correctly detects when the structure of a network is highly variable. We maintain that GDDA (and RGF distance, although space limitations preclude a discussion) faithfully detects genuine differences between the structure of various networks, thus making them of the latter sort. For example, consider two networks that have eight nodes and four edges each. The first consists of four isolated edges, while the other consists of one square and four isolated nodes. We can rightfully say that the two networks are different from each other, and both RGF distance and GDDA would detect this fact. Thus we see that it is not the measure that is unstable but the network structure itself. The measure simply reflects this 'instability' in networks with a relatively small number of edges. Thus, although it is true that GDDA has an abrupt drop at low edge density, we believe that this drop is due to network properties having a statistically high variance at low edge densities. This high variance is evident in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref>, where the 1 error bars are significantly larger at low densities than they are at high densities. This high variance in turn causes a low agreement when comparing two model networks that have low edge densities with each other. At higher edge densities, the statistical properties of two model networks become more similar, resulting in a higher GDDA. A simple analogy would be an experiment in which a fair coin is flipped n times in an attempt to experimentally determine the probability of heads. If n ¼ 0, then both experiments will agree in whatever 'assumed' probability is assigned a priori (analogous to GDDA ¼ 1 at zero edge density). If n is finite but small, then two experiments are likely to come up with substantially different estimates of the probability of heads, neither being close to the true value of 0.5. (This corresponds to the drop in GDDA at low but finite edge density.) However, as n ! 1, the law of large numbers ensures that both experiments will provide similar estimates, both being close to 0.5. (This corresponds to the 'recovery' of GDDA as density increases.) Model networks differ from this analogy in that even as n ! 1, the statistical difference between two models remains finite rather than approaching zero.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">The unstable region is small in large networks, and natural networks have densities outside this region</head><p>We wish to quantify the extent of the 'unstable' region to decide if a given network has a density in the 'unstable' density region.</p><p>The discussion associated with<ref type="figure">Figure</ref>. It is clear that the minimum GDDA score for GEO graphs occurs at a density that is proportional to k 1 =n for some value of k 1 , where n is the number of nodes in the graph. Furthermore, the 'recovery' referred to by<ref type="bibr">Rito</ref>(b) include one standard deviation error bars only for ER models, as all models have about the same variance as demonstrated in panel (c) for GEO networks. Green lines mark the edge densities of several viral PPI networks discussed in the text. In all cases, the viral PPI networks have densities outside the region of sensitivity</p><p>(a) ER model (b) GEO model<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>; they are grouped by color into kingdoms. As can be seen, in all cases the data networks are outside of the sensitive region for both ER and GEO models case, it is important to note that the width of the unstable region in density space asymptotically shrinks with increasing n. Even small real-world networks, such as the viral ones that will be discussed later in reference to<ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 6</ref>, have densities outside the unstable region. In particular,<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref>depicts the density of viral networks (green vertical lines in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2a</ref>and b) are in the 'stable' region, regardless of the assumed theoretical model.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>demonstrates a similar effect for larger networks. We plot a surface depicting the dependency of GDDA on the number of nodes n and the density for two types of model networks, ER and GEO. We also place each of the non-viral PPI networks from<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>in the ðn, Þ plane. As can be seen, none of these PPI networks are in the 'unstable' region of ER or GEO models. Note that the instability region and shape is different for different models; for example, the unstable region of GEO model is much smaller than the one of ER model with the same graph size and density. Furthermore, real PPI networks are not ER [e.g. Przˇulj<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Przˇulj et al. (2004)</ref>; PrzˇuljPrzˇulj (2007); also<ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 6</ref>]. We note that GDDA can be sensitive to noise, whereas conclusions about network fit using GDDA are robust to noise.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4</ref>depicts how GDDA responds when we add, delete and rewire up to 60% of the edges in the model networks. We note that as noise is added, GDDA generally (though not always) decreases. However, the ordering of which model best fits the data undergoes only small changes when noise is added because all the curves generally have a negative slope, indicating that the ordering of models on the horizontal axis remains the correct ordering of model fit, independent of noise level. Noise has also been extensively discussed previously (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Han et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kuchaiev et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Stumpf et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">PrzˇuljPrzˇulj, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">PrzˇuljPrzˇulj et al., 2004</ref>). As can be seen in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>, the largest PPI networks have thousands of nodes and tens of thousands of edges. Assuming a value of k 2 2 ½2, 5, we see that most of the real-world networks in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>We conclude that for large networks of substantial density, the width of the sensitive region is negligible, and that for even small networks that are relatively complete, their density is outside of the unstable region. This effect was not apparent in the studies performed by<ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Rito et al. (2010)</ref>because (i) they neglected to look at fairly small but complete networks such as viral ones, (ii) they restricted the size of their model networks to just 2000 nodes and did not study how the unstable region shrinks with increasing n and (iii) they neglected to take into account that local densities may be higher (see Section 3.4 below).</p></div>

In it, we demonstrate that even the early human Y2H PPI networks, HG and HS, have many more large dense graphlets than one would expect in random network models with average densities of these PPI networks. For example, the highlighted numbers for graphlet G 28 [taken from (<ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Rito et al., 2010)]</ref>indicate that we do not expect even one G 28 to appear in a 2000-node ER network until the density reaches 0.02495—more than 10 times the density of the HG network—and yet the HG network, with 1873 nodes and a density of just 0.00198, already contains 19 copies of this highly dense 5-node graphlet. Even if the same human PPI network were modeled as a GEO network, it is expected to have zero copies of graphlet G 28 , rather than 19. Furthermore, these human PPI networks contain millions of distinct 5-node graphlets, whereas the models predict only a few, at most. This tells us that a PPI network of low average density is not of uniformly low density, but instead contains highly dense subregions where the topology (and hence GDDA) is stable. This is also confirmed by a well-established observation that PPI networks have higher clustering coefficients than model networks (e.g. Przˇulj<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Przˇulj et al., 2004</ref>). This effect is also seen in larger clusters on the human PPI network HS (taken from<ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Stelzl et al., 2005</ref>).

			<note place="foot">W.Hayes et al. at :: on August 30, 2016 http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from Finally, the STICKY model is based on a stickiness index that is proportional to the degree of a node in a real network (PrzˇuljPrzˇulj and Higham, 2006). It is based on the assumption that the higher the degrees of two nodes, the more likely they are to be neighbours. 2.3.1 The utility of model networks &apos;In the further development of science, we want more than just a formula. First we have an observation, then we have numbers that we measure, then we have a law which summarizes all the numbers. But the real glory of science is that we can find a way of thinking such that the law becomes evident.&apos;—Richard P. Feynman, winner of the 1965 Nobel Prize in physics (Feynman, 1963). We have been asked several times by biologists, including reviewers of our articles, why modelling biological networks is important and what models might teach us. It is easiest to answer this question by providing an example of another science in which models have become vitally important: physics. Models provide us a way to think about a system in such a way that we can understand its behaviour; more importantly, a precise theoretical model allows us to predict a system&apos;s behaviour, so that we can learn how it reacts without having to experiment haphazardly on the system. For example, without a precise and predictive theory of gravity, we would not be able to understand the motion of planets, stars and galaxies, and NASA would not be able to launch robotic probes to the planets. A first step towards understanding biological networks is to develop mathematical models of their structure; these models may not yet have predictive value, but they have descriptive value, in the same way that detailed descriptions of observations of movement of planets centuries ago provided data for Newton to develop a predictive theory of gravity. Biological network data today are noisy and incomplete, so the network structure may be hidden by noise and adversely filtered by sampling, population averaging and other biases in data collection, handling and interpretation (Collins et al., 2007; Hakes et al., 2008; Han et al., 2005; Stumpf et al., 2005; von Mering et al., 2002). At this point in the development of structural models of biological networks, we cannot gain a detailed theoretical understanding of the networks. At best, we can try to measure statistical properties and develop models that have similar statistical properties to the real networks. Even this is an extremely difficult task. For one thing, graph theory tells us that large graphs can be almost infinitely complex in their structure; the number of undirected graphs with n nodes scales as Oð2 nðnÀ1Þ=2 Þ, which is a function that grows almost unimaginably fast. For example, the number of graphs with 22 nodes is already comparable with the number of atoms in the observable universe ($10 80 ); the number of graphs with 1000 nodes is $10 150000. Given these formidable difficulties, our goal at this juncture is not to find &apos;the&apos; model that fits the data—that is hopeless. Instead our goal should be simply to aim the development of our models in the right direction.</note>

(2010)</ref>provided a non-parametric test for assessing the fit between random model networks and real PPI networks. Given that our model networks are drawn at random from a particular distribution, each real PPI network will have a range of GDDAs with the random model networks. To obtain the distribution of GDDAs of model-to-model comparisons, we generate a number of model networks with the same size and density as the PPI network and compute the GDDAs across all pairs of these model networks. We also calculate the GDDAs between the PPI network and these random model networks to get the distribution of data-to-model comparisons. The difference between these two distributions can be used to evaluate the model fit.<ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Rito et al. (2010)</ref>were correct in that, to determine if a particular PPI data network 'fits' a particular model, we need to look at the distribution of GDDAs of many data-to-model comparisons. If the data network is truly well-fit by the model, then we would expect the distribution of data-to-model GDDAs to be the same as the distribution of model-to-model GDDAs. This non-parametric test is a good test, in that given any measure of network similarity, it allows us to see if the data network is or is not statistically distinguishable from the model networks. However,<ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Rito et al. (2010)</ref>use the amount of overlap between these two distributions (model–model GDDA distribution versus model–data GDDA distribution) as a simple binary criterion for whether the data fits the model, without regard to the actual values of the GDDA. We believe that this interpretation is too restrictive. We must keep in mind that these models are extremely preliminary and purely empirical. When fitting such rudimentary models to such noisy data, we must maintain a larger perspective than a simple 'yes/no' determination can provide. To improve our models, we need instead to consider some form of 'distance' between the model and the data. For example, consider the following two cases: (A) Model A has model–model GDDA distributed normally $99 AE 0.5% and model–data GDDA normally distributed $97 AE 0.5%; (B) Model B has model–model GDDA distributed normally $80 AE 15% and model–data GDDA normally distributed $70 AE 15%. The 'overlap' test would suggest that case (B) is better than case (A) because case (B) would have substantial overlap between distributions while case (A) has none. However, a model–data GDDAof 97% [case (A)] is phenomenally good (assuming the model is derived independently of the data) compared with a GDDA of just 70% [case (B)]. The fact that Model A has no overlap with the data may be attributed, for example, to the model being somehow too narrowly defined; perhaps the addition of a small amount of noise (to mimic noise in the data) would bring the model–data agreement down to 97%, providing a perfect overlap and a high GDDA. It is not clear to us that overlap alone should be the sole criterion for judging how well a model fits the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Viral PPI networks are well-fit by models</head><p>Large networks such as those fromare still noisy and very incomplete; the Arabidopsis Interactome Mapping Consortium (2011) claims only 2% coverage of the interactome (i.e. 98% false negative rate). In contrast, the substantially 'complete' networks of five herpes viruses depicted in(<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fossum et al., 2009</ref>) have 'only' $50% false-negative rate (<ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Sato et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Shimoda et al., 2008</ref>). These five herpesvirus PPI networks are substantially complete in the sense that all possible pairs of proteins were tested for interaction using Y2H technology. The species are as follows: varicella-zoster virus (VZV), Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), murine cytomegalovirus (mCMV) and Epstein–Barr virus (EBV).compares these complete PPI networks with six random graph models using the above-described non-parametric test (<ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Rito et al., 2010</ref>). In this test, we see that the ER random model is the worst fitting because in no case is there substantial overlap between the data–model distribution and the model–model distribution. As we move down the list of models in the figure, the amount of overlap generally increases until the STICKY model appears to have the greatest amount of overlap with four of the five viral PPI networks. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the structure of viral PPI networks has been modeled. Examining the biological reasons for the good fit of the STICKY model in 80% of the viral networks, and why it is a less good fit for KSHV, is a subject of future research. Similar plots (not shown because of space limitations) of three bacterial PPI networks<ref type="bibr">[MZL (Shimoda et al., 2008</ref>), SPP (<ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Sato et al., 2007</ref>) and CJJ (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Parrish et al., 2007)]</ref>, the functional interaction network of E. coli (<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Peregrı´nPeregrı´n-Alvarez et al., 2009</ref>), as well as the Arabidopsis thaliana PPI network (<ref type="bibr">Arabidopsis Interactome Mapping Consortium, 2011</ref>), and PPI networks of yeast, worm, fly and human from BioGRID, all indicate that STICKY, SF-GD and GEO-GD (in that order) are the best fitting models for these networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this article, we have examined the use of GDDA for biological network comparison. By generating the empirical distributions of GDDA scores, we have identified the edge density regions in which the topology of model networks is unstable. We show that the GDDA scores correctly measure this topological instability. These regions do not affect on the analysis of current PPI data, as current PPI data are dense enough to avoid these regions. We validate the use of GDDA for searching for well-fitting random models for PPI networks. We perform new fits to new PPI networks and demonstrate for the first time that five Viral PPI networks are will-fit by several models.</p></div>			</div>

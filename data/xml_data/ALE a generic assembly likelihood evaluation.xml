				<p>Motivation: Researchers need general purpose methods for objectively evaluating the accuracy of single and metagenome assemblies and for automatically detecting any errors they may contain. Current methods do not fully meet this need because they require a reference, only consider one of the many aspects of assembly quality or lack statistical justification, and none are designed to evaluate metagen-ome assemblies. Results: In this article, we present an Assembly Likelihood Evaluation (ALE) framework that overcomes these limitations, systematically evaluating the accuracy of an assembly in a reference-independent manner using rigorous statistical methods. This framework is comprehensive , and integrates read quality, mate pair orientation and insert length (for paired-end reads), sequencing coverage, read alignment and k-mer frequency. ALE pinpoints synthetic errors in both single and metagenomic assemblies, including single-base errors, inser-tions/deletions, genome rearrangements and chimeric assemblies presented in metagenomes. At the genome level with real-world data, ALE identifies three large misassemblies from the Spirochaeta smaragdinae finished genome, which were all independently validated by Pacific Biosciences sequencing. At the single-base level with Illumina data, ALE recovers 215 of 222 (97%) single nucleotide variants in a training set from a GC-rich Rhodobacter sphaeroides genome. Using real Pacific Biosciences data, ALE identifies 12 of 12 synthetic errors in a Lambda Phage genome, surpassing even Pacific Biosciences&apos; own variant caller, EviCons. In summary, the ALE framework provides a comprehensive, reference-independent and statistically rigorous measure of single genome and metagenome assembly accuracy, which can be used to identify misassemblies or to optimize the assembly process. Availability: ALE is released as open source software under the UoI/</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Recent advances in next-generation, high-throughput sequencing technologies have dramatically reduced the cost of sequencing (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Metzker, 2010</ref>). With the development of genome assemblers able to use large volumes of sequence data, reference genomes are now rapidly produced using the whole genome shotgun strategy, from small, simple microbial genomes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Wu et al., 2009</ref>) to large, complex plant or mammalian genomes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fujimoto et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Li et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Schmutz et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Zimin et al., 2008</ref>). Meanwhile, genomes are also being generated directly from complex communities using culture-independent approaches, including singe-cell genome sequencing and metagenome sequencing (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hess et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Iverson et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Woyke et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Yilmaz et al., 2011</ref>). The ability to assemble a metagenome is particularly important because resolving the genomes of individual species, or at least the most abundant, from a complex community is crucial to exploring inter-species interactions and understanding the community's structure, dynamics and function. Assembly of individual genomes from NGS datasets poses significant informatics challenges, including short read length, noisy data and large data volume (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lin et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Pop, 2009</ref>). Owing to these challenges, errors widely exist in single genome assemblies derived from NGS datasets, with different specific errors commonly associated with particular datasets, genomes and tools (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Haiminen et al., 2011</ref>). Beyond the challenges faced in assembling single genomes, metagenome assembly poses unique additional challenges. First, although the sequence depth of a single genome should be approximately uniform, the sequence depth of genomes in a metagenome varies greatly. Second, the difficulty of resolving repetitive regions within a single genome is exacerbated in metagenome assembly because conserved genomic regions and lateral gene transfer greatly increase the portion of falsely identified repetitive genomic regions. Despite these unique challenges, assemblers designed for single genomes are being applied to metagenome data without being significantly modified to systematically address errors introduced in this way (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hess et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Iverson et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Qin et al., 2010</ref>). Several tools have been developed to detect errors in single genome assemblies. If a reference genome for the targeted organism is available, or one is available from a closely related species, erroneous insertions, deletions or large gaps can be detected by *To whom correspondence should be addressed. ß The Author 2013.

For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com comparative analysis of the reference and the genome assembly in question (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Darling et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Earl et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Meader, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Salzberg et al., 2012</ref>). If a reference is unavailable, the alignment of the raw reads with their assembly provides indirect measures of assembly quality such as coverage depth and mate pair consistency. This information can then be used to detect single-base changes, repeat condensation or expansion, false segmental duplications and other misassemblies (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Choi et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Narzisi and Mishra, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Phillippy et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Vezzi et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Zimin et al., 2008</ref>). Despite this progress, researchers still lack a method that integrates indirect measures of read alignment quality in a quantitative, comprehensive and statistically well-founded manner to systematically detect errors in single genome assemblies. Moreover, metrics suitable for evaluating metagenome assembly accuracy, and associated quantitative methods for detecting errors in metagenome assemblies, have yet to be developed. In this work, we develop a novel statistical model for evaluating assembly accuracy in a reference-independent manner. Using Bayesian statistics, we give an expression for the probability that an assembly is correct, and provide an automated software tool Assembly Likelihood Evaluation (ALE) based on this expression. The provided tool may be used in three ways. First, it allows examining the contribution to this probability of correctness from each base in the assembly, which can be used to identify specific errors and their locations. This is particularly useful for genome finishing. Second, it provides an overall score for different assemblies of the same genome or metagenome, thereby enabling comparison of these assemblies and optimization of the assembly process. Third, when applying re-sequencing data to a reference genome, ALE can detect structural variations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">The ALE score and the likelihood of an assembly</head><p>The ALE framework is founded on a statistical model that describes two probabilities: a Bayesian prior probability distribution PðSÞ describing the likelihood of an assembly S without any read information and a probability PðRjSÞ describing the likelihood of a set of reads, R, being generated from an assembly, S. The prior PðSÞ can be computed using the k-mer distribution of the assembly, whereas the likelihood PðRjSÞ is calculated from information about read quality, agreement between the mapped reads and the proposed assembly, mate pair orientation, insert length (paired-end reads) and sequencing depth. A detailed description of the likelihood and prior probability is given in the following. The ALE score, except for a proportionality constant that depends on the reads but not on the assembly, is the logarithm of the probability that the assembly is correct, PðSjRÞ. According to Bayes' rule, this probability is PðSjRÞ ¼ PðRjSÞPðSÞ=Z: ð1Þ where Z is a proportionality constant ensuring PðSjRÞ is a probability distribution. As is typical in large-scale applications of Bayesian statistics, computing Z exactly is intractable. The ALE score is computed by replacing Z with an approximation described in the Supplementary Materials, and then taking the logarithm of the resulting approximation to PðSjRÞ. The ALE score can be used to compare two different assemblies of the same genome, S 1 and S 2. Call A 1 , the ALE score of the first assembly, and A 2 , the ALE score of the second, both generated from the same set of reads R. The difference of these scores is then given by the equation</p><formula>A 1 À A 2 ¼ log P S 1 jR ð Þ P S 2 jR ð Þ : ð2Þ</formula><p>The assembly with the higher ALE score is also the one with the larger probability of being correct. Moreover, the difference between two assemblies' ALE scores describes their relative probabilities of correctness. Below, we refer to the ALE score more precisely as the total ALE score, to differentiate it from the sub-scores (described later in the text) used to construct it. Although the ALE score can be reported as a standalone value, this is made possible only to facilitate comparisons with other assemblies of the same genome. We emphasize that the ALE score is a comparative measure and should not be used to judge the quality of a single assembly in isolation, as errors in estimating Z may cause a large difference between the ALE score and logðPðSjRÞÞ. We also emphasize that the ALE score should only be used to compare different assemblies of the same genome, for which the ALE scores have been calculated using the same set of reads.<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>shows the pipeline used to compute the total ALE score. Given a set of reads and a proposed assembly, ALE first takes as input the alignments of the reads onto the assembly in the form of a SAM or BAM file (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Li et al., 2009</ref>), which can be produced by a third-party alignment algorithm such as bowtie (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Langmead et al., 2009</ref>) or bwa (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Li et al., 2009</ref>). ALE then determines the probabilistic placement of each read and a corresponding placement sub-score for each mapped base, which describes how well the read agrees with the assembly. In the case of pairedend reads, ALE also calculates an insert sub-score for all mapped bases of the assembly from the read pair, which describes how well the distance between the mapped reads matches the distribution of lengths that we would expect from the sequencing library. This insert sub-score is similar to the compression-expansion (CE) statistic of<ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Zimin et al. (2008)</ref>with details given in the Supplementary Materials. ALE also calculates a depth sub-score, which measures the evenness of the sequencing depth accounting for the GC bias prevalent in some NGS techniques. The placement, insert and depth sub-scores together determine PðRjSÞ. Independently, with only the assembly and not the reads, ALE calculates the k-mer sub-score and the prior PðSÞ. Each sub-score is calculated for each scaffold or contig within an assembly independently, allowing for genome variations commonly found in metagenomes because each contig/scaffold is likely from a different species with a different k-mer profile. The four sub-scores are then combined to form the total ALE score. The constituent calculations in this pipeline are described in the Supplementary Material. The contributions to these four sub-scores are reported by ALE as a function of position within the assembly and can be visualized with the included plotting package or exported to genome viewers including the Integrative Genomics Viewer (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Nicol et al., 2009</ref>) and the UCSC genome browser (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Kent et al., 2002</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Details of the probabilistic ingredients of the ALE score</head><p>We now describe the four sub-scores (placement, insert, depth and k-mer) and the role they play within the ALE framework. The first three of these sub-scores appear in the likelihood PðRjSÞ. ALE computes PðRjSÞ using a probabilistic model for the way in which reads are generated from an assembly during the whole genome shotgun sequencing process. This model makes independence assumptions that decomposes this probability into a product of three terms, PðRjSÞ ¼ P placement ðRjSÞP insert ðRjSÞP depth ðRjSÞ: ð3Þ</p><p>Each term is a separate sub-score and is explained later in the text in detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Placement P placement ðRjSÞ</head><p>quantifies how well the sequence of the reads agrees with the assembly. Assuming that every paired read r i is generated independently from the assembly, the probability of a set of reads R given an assembly S is P placement ðRjSÞ ¼ Q ri2R P placement r i jS ð Þ, where P placement r i jS ð Þ is itself the product of two independent probability distributions, P placement r i jS ð Þ ¼ P matches ðr i jSÞP orientation ðr i jSÞ.</p><p>Here, P matches r i jS ð Þ describes how well the read matches the subsection of the assembly to which it maps, and P orientation r i jS ð Þ describes whether the mate pairs have an orientation that is consistent with the library. We now describe in detail how these two probabilities are computed, beginning with P matches r i jS ð Þ. Assuming that each base j of the read is correctly called by the sequencer independently with a probability equal to the base's quality score Q j , we have P matches r i jS ð Þ ¼ Q basej2ri P base j jS À Á , where P base j jS À Á ¼ Q j when the base j correctly matches the assembly and P base j jS À Á ¼ ð1 À Q j Þ=4 when it does not. This expression follows from our modeling assumption that all four possible errors that the sequencer could have reported (three different substitutions and deletion) are equally likely when the read does not match the sequence. If the assembly has an unknown base (denoted 'N'), we set P base j jS À Á ¼ 1=4, modeling the lack of information about the correct base at that location. If an ambiguity code is reported by the sequencer, then the aforementioned expression is modified to account for the distribution over the possible bases encoded by that code. Each read may only be 'placed' at a single position in the assembly. If the aligner placed a particular read at more than one position, we choose one position at random, weighting by P placement ðr j jSÞ. This allows for repeat regions to be properly represented with the correct number of reads in expectation. The orientation likelihood, P orientation r i jS ð Þ, is calculated by first counting the number of times that each orientation occurs in each library from the mapping information. The likelihood P orientation r i jS ð Þ is then the empirical frequency of the observed orientation of the read r i in the library to which r i belongs. (This likelihood can also be overridden with user-specified values.) We also derive per-base placement sub-scores at each position in the assembly. The placement sub-score at a particular position is the geometric mean Q ri</p><formula>P placement ðr i jSÞ " # 1=N</formula><p>, where the product is over all reads r i covering the given position, and N is the number of such reads.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Insert P insert RjS</head><p>ð Þ describes how well the mate pairs' insert lengths match those we would expect and is computed as P insert RjS ð Þ¼ Q ri2R P insert r i jS ð Þ. The insert likelihood, P insert ðr i jSÞ, is determined by first observing all insert lengths from all mappings of all reads and calculating the population mean, , and variance, 2 , of these lengths (the mean and variance can also be set by the user, if they are known). This step only needs to be done once. Once completed, we calculate the insert likelihood for each read pair r i by assuming that the observed insert length L i is distributed normally with this mean and variance, P insert ðr i jSÞ ¼ NormalðL i ; , 2 Þ As with the placement sub-score, we calculate the insert sub-score at a position as the geometric mean of the P insert r i jS ð Þof all reads r i covering that position. This can identify areas of constriction or expansion within a proposed assembly. The insert sub-score is similar to the CE statistics of<ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Zimin et al. (2008)</ref>, as we now show. To describe the similarity, we first write the insert sub-score as Q</p><formula>i ð2 2 Þ À1=2 exp À ðLiÀÞ 2 2 2 ! 1=N ¼ ð2 2 Þ À1=2 exp À 1 2 2 N P N i¼1 ðL i À Þ 2 ,</formula><p>where the products and sums over i are over all reads covering a given position, and N is the number of such reads. We now use the fact that 1<ref type="figure">1</ref>. The components of the total ALE score. ALE takes a proposed assembly and an alignment of reads as input. Four scores, the k-mer, placement, depth and insert sub-scores are computed using the model described in Section 2. From the four scores, a total ALE score is calculated and reported as a text file (.ale), and the text file can be used for input into the supplied plotter to generate a PDF file for visualization</p><formula>N P N i¼1 ðL i À Þ 2 ¼ S 2 þ ðM À Þ 2 , where M ¼ 1 N P i L i is</formula><formula>1 2 N P N i¼1 ðL i À Þ 2 ¼ S 2 2 þ N Â CE 2 .</formula><p>As N grows large, the CE statistic is asymptotically normal, owing to the central limit theorem. The log of the insert sub-score can then be written À 1 2 ½logð2 2 Þ þ ðS 2 = 2 Þ þ N Â CE 2 . The insert sub-score is decreasing in S 2 2 þ N Â CE 2 , and the term involving the CE statistic dominates when N is large. Thus, when N is large, the positions with lowest insert sub-score are those positions whose CE statistic is furthest from 0. This, flagging those regions with low insert-sub score is similar to the rule recommended in<ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Zimin et al. (2008)</ref>of flagging those regions with jCEj larger than a fixed cutoff value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3">Depth P depth ðRjSÞ describes how</head><p>well the depth at each location agrees with the depth that we would expect, given the GC content at that location. It is the product of a depth sub-score over all positions in the assembly, P depth ðRjSÞ ¼ Q i P depth ðd i jSÞ, where d i is the depth at position i. The depth d i is ideally Poisson-distributed (Lander and<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Waterman, 1988</ref>). However, most next-generation sequencers and library preparation techniques can bias GC-rich areas of a genome (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aird et al., 2011</ref>). This bias affects the observed depth in specific areas. We model the depths as Poisson distributed about a mean drawn from an independent Gamma distribution centered at the expected depth for that position, given its GC content. This models our uncertainty about the mean of the Poisson distribution, arising from the dependence of the expected depth on more than just the GC content at that position, including 'hard stops', and the GC content at nearby positions. It results in an infinite mixture of Poissons that is equivalent to a Negative Binomial distribution. We first calculate for each of the following 100 ranges of GC content, 0–1, 1–2,. . ., 99–100%, the average observed depth over positions in the assembly whose GC content (calculated as the GC content within an average read length) is within this range. Let depthðXiÞ be the average observed depth for the GC content range in which X i falls, where X i is the GC content percentage averaged across all reads that map (in the placement step) to that position. If any depth ðX i Þ falls below a minimum value of 10, we use this minimum value instead. This discounts regions of exceptionally low average depth. Then, at any given position i, the depth sub-score is</p><formula>P depth d j jS, X i À Á ¼ R 1 0 Poisson d j ; Y i À Á GammaðY i ; maxð10, depthðXiÞ Þ, 1Þ dY i ¼ NegBinom ðd j ; maxð10, depth(X i ) ),1/2).</formula><p>2.2.4 k-mer P kmer ðSÞ / PðSÞ describes the likelihood of the assembly S, in the absence of any read information. Within this prior probability distribution, we encode the belief that within a single genome, each k-mer (a permutation of k base pairs, where k is a fixed user defined number initially set to 4) has a unique k-mer frequency. The 4 k dimensional vector giving this frequency for each k-mer is conserved across a genome and can help determine if two different genomes have been mistakenly combined (<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Teeling et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Woyke et al., 2006</ref>). Let K be the set of all possible unique k-mers, so jKj ¼ 4 k , and for each i in K let n i be the number of times this k-mer appears in a contig in the assembly. Then, the frequency f i of a particular k-mer i within a contig is f i ¼ n i = P j2K n j. The k-mer score is the product of this frequency over each k-mer appearing in each contig of the assembly S, which can be written as P kmer ðSÞ ¼ Q i2K f ni i. This is equivalent to assuming each k-mer in the assembly is drawn independently from a common multinomial distribution with probabilities empirically estimated from the assembly. This prior distribution does not account for horizontal gene transfer, e.g. from phages, and thus may inappropriately flag such regions as being misassembled. The k-mer sub-score of a base at any given position in the assembly is the geometric average of P kmer ðSÞ of all k-mers that cover that position. In calculating this average, the very first base in the genome only has one contributing k-mer, the second has two, up to k contributing k-mers after k À 1 bases.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Performance on major types of misassemblies in a genome assembly with synthetic data</head><p>Common assembly errors include single-base substitutions, insertion/deletions, chimeric assemblies derived from translocations or misjoins and copy number errors derived from repeat condensation/expansions. To test ALE's ability to detect such errors, we generated synthetic reads from a reference genome and then seeded the reference with each type of error. First, 400 000 pair-end synthetic reads were generated from the first 350 Kb at random positions of Escherichia coli K12 Substrain DH10B (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Durfee et al., 2008</ref>), with insert length normally distributed with mean 200 b and standard deviation 7 b. Next, synthetic misassemblies were introduced at six locations within this reference. The misassemblies introduced were a substitution, insertion, deletion, inversion, translocation and a copy number error, respectively. We treated this mutated genome as the proposed assembly. We tested ALE by aligning the aforementioned synthetic reads to the proposed assembly using bowtie (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Langmead et al., 2009</ref>) and ran the results through the ALE software package. The ALE plotter automatically thresholds each error and produces plots of the sub-scores near each error (see the Supplementary Materials). We found that ALE is able to locate each type of error in the proposed assembly. At the genome level, as shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>, at least one of the four sub-scores drops dramatically in each region containing a synthetic error and reports no false discoveries. These results suggest that ALE systematically reports all major types of errors with simulated data. Furthermore, the total ALE score decreases, as more errors are added to the assembly. As shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3A</ref>, as the number of substitution, insertion and deletion errors increases, the total ALE score decreases monotonically, at a rate determined by the quality scores of the data (see Section 2). This suggests that the total ALE score indicates overall assembly accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Detecting chimeric assemblies in a synthetic metagenome</head><p>One common assembly error in metagenome assemblies is a chimeric assembly consisting of two or more genomes. To test ALE's ability to distinguish this type of metagenome-specific error, we simulated a misassembled contig by joining several pieces of two genomes in random order. This use of a known, synthetic reference is required for testing ALE's sensitivity to chimeric metagenomes in an unbiased way, as there are no true metagenome references available. In these tests, the k-mer score drops markedly at the interface of the two genomes in the synthetic metagenome, as shown in the Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S1.</ref>ALE relies on the k-mer sub-score (the default is k ¼ 4) to distinguish contigs coming from different microbial species, as tetra-nucleotide frequencies are a reliable species-specific signature (<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Teeling et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Woyke et al., 2006</ref>). If a genome, or contig, contains two or more distinct regions characterized by different k-mer vectors, then the k-mer sub-score will be lowerfor the positions characterized by the less prevalent k-mer vector (see Section 2). Because the other sub-scores are unaffected by the mixture, the drop in total ALE score is owing to the lower k-mer sub-score. This unique capability of ALE allows easy detection of chimeric contig/scaffolds within a metagenome assembly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Discovery of real errors in a genome assembly using real data</head><p>The aforementioned experiments used simulated reads or assemblies with simulated errors. Noise in real reads, and real errors in genome/metagenome assemblies, often has a complex structure, presenting an additional challenge to ALE. To test ALE using real world assemblies with real reads, we chose a finished genome, Spirochaeta smargdinae DSM 11293, originally constructed from 454 and Illumina reads (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Mavromatis et al., 2010</ref>) and applied ALE to it using one lane of 2 Â 76 paired-end Illumina reads. The results are shown in the Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. S2</ref>. At the genome level, ALE found five errors, including a large 560 Kb region (3.91–4.48 Mb) in the proposed assembly where the depth sub-score dropped below the threshold. We found three areas producing errors that are likely due to repeat condensation. For example, further examination of two regions (408–415 Kb and 4.241–4.247 Mb) by overlaying the Illumina short read data indicates these regions have much higher sequence depth (2Â) than neighboring regions and contain many SNPs (two alleles of roughly equal ratio) (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig.  S2B</ref>and C), supporting the hypothesis that there are two copies of these regions in this genome. The boundaries of these regions also have abnormal placement and insert sub-scores, further supporting the hypothesis that there are misassemblies at the aforementioned locations. To determine whether these errors identified by ALE are true assembly errors or Illumina sequencing artifacts, we independently validated the results using Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) sequencing data. A total of 53 SMRT cells comprising 221 Mb of mapped reads or 34 folds of coverage were aligned to the assembly. Manual inspection of the resulting PacBio alignment confirms 5/5 assembly errors (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. S2B</ref>and C), suggesting the errors identified by ALE are true errors in the assembly. The locations of these errors, and sub-score that caused the violation, are given in the Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Total ALE scores and genome assembly accuracy</head><p>Assemblies generated by eight different assembly protocols from three datasets (Staphylococcus aureus, Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Human chromosome 14) were selected from the GAGE study (<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Salzberg et al., 2012</ref>) to evaluate how well ALE scores reflect assembly accuracy. As a positive control, the reference genome was evaluated in parallel with the other assemblies. For all three genomes, Illumina sequencing data from both a short fragment and a short jumping library were used to generate ALE scores. Total ALE scores were generated for each assembly and each library as described previously. Results are shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3B</ref>. Although that there is no quantitative measurement of assembly accuracy (other than ALE itself) for use in validation, the GAGE study did indicate the AllPaths-LG and SOAPdenovo usually give more accurate assemblies. In addition, the reference genome should represent an assembly with best quality. As shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3B</ref>, ALE scores are consistent with these notions. Among all the assemblies, ALE scores consistently indicate the reference genomes are the best assemblies, and assemblies from AllPaths-LG and SOAPdenovo consistently have better ALE scores than those from other assemblers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Sensitivity to single nucleotide variations in real data</head><p>We tested ALE's ability to detect single base errors in real data from a resequencing project. In this project, one lane of Illumina 36 Â 2 paired reads was generated from a new strain of R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Choudhary et al., 2006</ref>) with an insert length of 200 b covering the genome with an average coverage depth of 557. This genome has a high GC content (68%) and contains 336 hard stops and many more low depth regions. A hard stop is a regionwhere a bias in the sequencer causes it to report 0 depth (no reads) without any read pairs spanning the region. Because low-coverage regions make single nucleotide variation (SNV) detection less reliable for many SNP detectors (<ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Wang et al., 2011</ref>), we excluded such regions and manually compiled a reference set of 222 possible SNVs for this strain (176 from Chromosome1, length 3.2 Mb; 46 from Chromosome2, length 0.94 Mb). The placement sub-score was then computed using the aligned reads. To enumerate the positions that ALE found to detract the most from the assembly's probability of correctness, we sorted the placement sub-scores for each chromosome. The 0.0001% worst scoring positions (219 regions) on Chromosome1 are within a read length of 154 of the 176 variants (88%), and the top 0.0005% worst positions (977 regions) are within a read length of 497% of the variants. The same experiment for Chromosome2 recovers 87% (40 of 46 variants from 63 regions) and 96% (from 309 regions), respectively. This shows that the positions at which the proposed assembly differs from the genome generating the reads are among the positions with the worst sub-scores. The regions with poor sub-scores that do not correspond to the variant list are other regions of the assembly unsupported by the read evidence, such as hard stops regions of low coverage that stem from the bias of the sequencer. This shows that ALE can locate regions unsupported by the read evidence, including SNVs, and that ALE accurately gauges assembly accuracy at single base resolution.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">ALE's sensitivity and specificity</head><p>Six assemblies of S. aureus were selected (<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Salzberg et al., 2012</ref>) to evaluate ALE's ability to detect assembly errors<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, leaving out an assembly from SGA because it was too fragmented. To compile a reference set of assembly errors, each assembly is aligned to the reference genome using nucmer as described in<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Salzberg et al. (2012)</ref>. Misassemblies were approximated by the alignment breaks, as most misassemblies will generate one or more breaks in the alignment (referred as NUCMER-Break). Gaps in the assemblies were excluded from consideration, as they do not necessarily represent assembly errors. Scaffolds that are smaller than 1 Kb were also excluded. Single-base differences were obtained by the show-snps command of the MUMmer package (referred to as NUCMER-SNV). To obtain a list of regions identified by ALE as potentially containing errors, ALE per-base insert and placement scores were computed using a short fragment library against each of the six assemblies. Depth scores were not used, as Illumina sequencing data tends to be noisy. At each ALE score cutoff, the top-ranked bases were selected, and adjacent bases were merged into regions. If a region/base contained a NUCMER-SNV, or was within þ/À50 bases centered at a NUCMER-Break, it was classified as a true positive for NUCMER-SNV or a NUCMER-Break, respectively. Otherwise, it was classified as 'Novel'. ALE can capture 15– 70% of the break points at a stringent threshold (top 1000,<ref type="figure">Fig. 4A</ref>) among the six assemblies. At the same threshold, 40–78% of the ALE calls are classified as novel. These 'novel' sites are not necessarily false positives. As shown in<ref type="figure">Figure 4B</ref>, many of the 'novel' sites are actually SNPs, supported by the underlying short read data (colored vertical bars in the coverage track). Currently, ALE does not distinguish real SNPs from false positives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7">ALE's performance with PacBio RS data</head><p>The aforementioned experiments were all performed with next generation short read data. Currently, the PacBio sequencing platform, also referred to as third-generation sequencing, is becoming increasingly popular owing to its long read length (up to several Kb) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Eid et al., 2009</ref>). These long reads are expected to greatly reduce the complexity associated with genome assembly validation. In contrast with second-generation sequencing, single-molecule-based PacBio RS sequencing has a much higher base error rate ($15%), making it an ideal candidate for testing the robustness of ALE against very noisy data. With this purpose, we examined the reference genome of Lambda Phage and corresponding PacBio reads of average depth 548Â and a randomly sampled set at 50Â. To determine ALE's performance on this dataset, the reference genome was synthetically mutated by adding 12 substitution, insertion and deletion errors at various locations (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S2</ref>). At 548Â depth, within the top 12 worst placement sub-scores, ALE recovered all 12 errors at the mutated positions, while reporting no false positives. At 50Â depth, excluding the low coverage edges, the 12 errors were detected in the top 14 worst placement sub-scores, with 2 false positives. In comparison, the standard Pacific Biosciences variant caller, EviCons, correctly identified only 10 of these errors with low confidence at default settings and the full 548Â depth. This shows that ALE is a robust measure of assembly accuracy with noisy sequencing data and is a generic framework that can be used with both short and long sequence read technologies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DISCUSSION</head><p>ALE facilitates the rapid discovery of many types of errors in genome assemblies including metagenomes. It does this by applying a rigorous statistical model, calculating the likelihood of observing a specific assembly, given the reads that were used to generate it, and calculating the contribution to this likelihood from each position in the assembly. This allows ALE to determine specific regions within a proposed assembly that are poorly supported by the reads. By integrating several aspects of the assembly and the reads, including k-mer composition, sequence depth, insert length and how well individual bases map, ALE is able to find errors as small as a single substitution error or indel, as well as large copy number errors and chimeric metagenome assemblies. This framework can serve as a guide in optimizing genome assemblies in the following two ways. First, total ALE scores can be used to identify the best assembly from those generated by different assembly protocols. Second, by modifying the regions in which ALE reports low sub-scores, more accurate genomes can be constructed. The space of possible corrections to an input genome is too large to allow the current implementation of ALE to be used as an independent assembler, but it could be used to compare and combine the results from different assemblers and produce an assembly that is most likely to be correct. ALE could also be used to present an alternative method for ALE calculating assembly accuracy in local assembly algorithms such as Genovo (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Laserson et al., 2011</ref>). When used with a reference genome and resequencing data, ALE can discover structural variations. As shown in the cases of Spirochaeta smaragdinae and R. sphaeroides, ALE readily detects structural variations whose sizes vary from a single base to several hundred kilobases. ALE currently does not classify the type of assembly errors. Future work is needed to determine the profile of each type of assembly errors in a dataset-specific manner. Once ALE has this capability, it could guide an auto-correction algorithm to automatically fix problematic regions. The effectiveness of ALE is influenced by the quality of its input: the read data and the alignments of those reads onto the A B<ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>. ALE identifies regions with potential assembly errors. (A) Cumulative plots showing the percentage of assembly errors detected by ALE at different sensitivity thresholds. Detected assembly break points (break sensitivity), and novel calls (novel) at different ALE insert or placement thresholds (ALE Top Scores) for six assemblies of Staphylococcus using six different assemblers are shown. (B) A snapshot from Integrative Genomics Viewer for a scaffold from the velvet assembly of Staphlococcus. In the track Coverage, the height represents sequencing depth, and vertical colored bars represent potential SNPs. In the track Raw Reads, each gray horizontal bar represents a high quality aligned read, whereas horizontal color bars represent reads that may indicate problems (e.g. insert size is too big or too small). Vertical color bars are bases different from the reference sequence.

			<note place="foot">at :: on August 30, 2016 http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from proposed assembly. Data with biased content or alignments, while accepted by ALE, tend to produce noisy sub-scores. The robustness of ALE, however, allows for the recovery of an accurate assembly accuracy measure as long as the random noise is consistent with the statistical model used by ALE (see Section 2). The effectiveness of ALE is also influenced, like any Bayesian method, by the modeling assumptions implicit in its prior and likelihood. ALE&apos;s prior relies on the species-specific signature provided by tera-nucleotide frequencies (Teeling et al., 2004; Woyke et al., 2006), which enhances ALE&apos;s ability to detect contaminants from single genome assemblies and cross-assembly of genomes from related species, but may also lead to false positives in regions of horizontal gene transfer. Additionally, the insert score assumes that insert lengths are normally distributed, whereas other distributions may work better for some libraries. Future work could use an insert length distribution estimated non-parametrically from the data. ALE could also be extended in future work to account for other factors that may currently lead to false positives, like origin of replication bias prevalent in circular genomes, horizontal gene transfer, automatic detection of sequencer bias and other distributions for insert length and coverage depth. Biases such as hard stops in Illumina could potentially be found by examining unlikely distributions of read orientation at specific locations coupled with low depth. Specific signatures within the different ALE metrics could be used to classify and correct for specific biases, much as ALE currently corrects for GC content (see Section 2).</note>

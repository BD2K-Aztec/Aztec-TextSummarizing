				<p>Motivation: The next-generation high-throughput sequencing technologies, especially from Illumina, have been widely used in re-sequencing and de novo assembly studies. However, there is no existing software that can simulate Illumina reads with real error and quality distributions and coverage bias yet, which is very useful in relevant software development and study designing of sequencing projects. Results: We provide a software package, pIRS (profile-based Illumina pair-end reads simulator), which simulates Illumina reads with empirical Base-Calling and GC%-depth profiles trained from real re-sequencing data. The error and quality distributions as well as coverage bias patterns of simulated reads using pIRS fit the properties of real sequencing data better than existing simulators. In addition, pIRS also comes with a tool to simulate the heterozygous diploid genomes.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>In recent years, the next-generation high-throughput sequencing technologies (NGS) have been widely used for re-sequencing and de novo assembly, such as the 1000 human genomes project (http://www.1000genomes.org) and the 10 000 vertebrate genomes project (http://genome10k.soe.ucsc.edu). According to information from GenomeWeb (http://www.genomeweb.com), Illumina has become dominant in the NGS market by the end of 2010. It has been reported that the Illumina technology rarely contains insertion and deletion errors, but it may produce systematic (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Dohm et al., 2008</ref>) and sequence-specific substitution errors (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Nakamura et al., 2011</ref>) and coverage bias problems (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aird et al., 2011</ref>) during library construction and sequencing process. It is thus important to be aware of these characteristics for method development. Although, evaluating software performance on real sequencing data * To whom correspondence should be addressed. â€  The authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the first four authors should be regarded as joint First<ref type="bibr">Authors.</ref>is preferred, not all evaluations can be conducted on real data due to the lack of a ground truth. It is frequently more convenient to test the software with simulated data from a known genome, which helps us monitoring every step. There are already some simulators that can produce Illumina reads, such as MAQ (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Li et al., 2008</ref>), wgsim from SAMTOOLS (), MetaSim (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Richter et al., 2008</ref>) and ART (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Huang et al., 2012</ref>). Of all the existing softwares, wgsim only simulates reads with uniform substitution errors and dummy quality values; MetaSim is designed for simulating metagenomic data, and it supports empirical error profile to generate reads without quality values; ART simulates Illumina reads with empirical quality profile, which determines quality value first and then uses the qualityderived error rate to randomly generate substitution error; MAQ adopts a first-order Markov chain to model quality distribution of each cycle, which generates quality values based on the transition probabilities and then uses the quality-derived error rate to randomly generate substitution error. In this article, we present a new Illumina pair-end (PE) reads simulator pIRS (profile-based Illumina pair-end reads simulator), which adopts an empirical Base-Calling profile that is more like the real Illumina data. Moreover, it can use a GC content-coverage depth (GC%-depth) profile to simulate reads with coverage bias along the genome. We also provide a tool to introduce changes (substitution, insertion, deletion and other variations) to the genome, to facilitate simulation of heterozygous data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">DESCRIPTION</head><p>The overall workflow of pIRS is shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>. The empirical Base-Calling profiles are generated by analyzing the alignment results of SOAP2 () or SAM/BAM files (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Li and Durbin, 2010</ref>) from re-sequencing data of known genomes. Only the uniquely mapped reads with full length matches are used to avoid the influence of mis-alignments. An SNP set can be optimally provided to eliminate non-error substitutions caused by true sequence variations. As the determination of a base-calling (base and quality) is highly related with the current cycle number and reference base on reads, we use a 4D distribution matrix (Dist matrix) to store the overall distribution information. The dimensions are read cycle, reference base, called base and called quality in sequential. In the Dist matrix, base-calling is only determined by information from the current cycle. However, the called quality is often seriously affected by the quality of previous cycle. To better simulates the realdata, we introduce a quality-transition (Qtrans) matrix based on the first-order Markov Chain similar to MAQ, in which the distribution of leading and following quality-pairs are recorded for each read cycle. The Qtrans matrix can be co-used with the Dist matrix after the first cycle, in which the called quality is determined first by the Qtrans matrix, and then the called base is determined from a subset of the Dist matrix with specified called quality. The combination of Dist and Qtrans matrics forms our Base-Calling profile. The relationship between GC content and coverage depth is analyzed using tiling windows along the whole genome. In each window, the GC content and average base depth are calculated, respectively, then the average base depth values are grouped by GC content intervals (1%), and finally the mean depth value is calculated for each GC content interval. This is defined as the GC%-depth profile in this article, which reflects the mean coverage depth in sequence regions with similar GC content. The GC%-depth profile can then be chosen to simulate reads with coverage bias, in which the sampling probability of a read with specific GC content is proportional to the mean coverage depth within that CG content interval. To simulate InDel errors, we provide a practical empirical InDel profile, which consists of three dimensions: read cycle, type (insertion and deletion) and length of continuous bases (1â€“3 bp). Our InDel profile is more comprehensive than that of other simulators, which generally use the simple uniform distributions of singlebase InDel errors. Considering the fact that InDel error is quite rare in Illumina, this function is often negligible in many real applications. Our reads simulator pIRS generates pair-end (PE) reads in the FASTQ format. For each read pair, the insert size is randomly drawn from the normal distribution with given mean and SD values. The Dist and Qtrans matrics are used to generate the called base and quality, the Indel profile is used to generate InDel errors and the GC%-depth profile is used to generate coverage bias. Note that the Qtrans, InDel and GC%-depth profiles can be optionally chosen from the pIRS parameter settings. Since heterozygosity is an important factor for many applications, such as variation detection and de novo assembly, we provide a tool to randomly introduce variations including single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), small insertion and deletion (InDel) and structural variation (large insertion, deletion and inversion) into the given reference genome, and output the resulting haploid genome in the FASTA format. The combination of two haploid genomes form a heterozygous diploid genome and our simulator can take these two genome files together to simulate heterozygous reads data. With pIRS, we have generated a set of empirical Base-Calling, GC%-depth and InDel profiles from our testing data, and common users can use these profiles directly to simulate Illumina reads. Only those users with special purpose need to generate profiles with new sequencing data by themselves. Note that the amount of training data should be enough to capture all the properties of real sequencing data. We suggest using âˆ¼30 G bases that is equivalent to 10 Ã— human data. The core programs in pIRS is written in C++ language and optimized for efficiency. The reference genomes are parsed one chromosome at a time to save memory. Both compressed (gzip) input and output files are supported to save disk space. Other programs are organized into perl pipelines to facilitate usage. The detailed methods and results for profile generation, heterozygous genome generation, reads simulation, as well as performance comparison to other existing simulators and the testing results of simulated reads in SNP calling are shown in the Supplementary Material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">DISCUSSION</head><p>Illumina has introduced EAMSS filtering in its CASAVA package, which masks low-quality G-rich regions at the end of each read with fixed quality value 'B'. It is mainly designed for easier data trimming in general re-sequencing analyses, but this will slightly influence our profile generation. We suggest all quality-aware analysis to run CASAVA with '-no-eamss' to disable the EAMSS filtering. The current Base-Calling and InDel profiles in pIRS focus on the perread-cycle properties but do not take the sequence-structure-specific errors into consideration. In Illumina sequencing, coverage bias is a complex problem and GC-content is a well-studied one of all the influencing factors. We will introduce more types of coverage biases once they are well-studied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">CONCLUSION</head><p>We designed and implemented an effective Illumina reads simulator pIRS using empirical profiles, to reproduce reads that are more like real Illumina data compared with existing simulators, which is likely to be very helpful for development of NGS software such as de novo assembly, SNP calling and structural variation detection. The independent profile generating module in pIRS grants great freedom to users, who can generate new profiles with their own sequencing data when machine or reagent updates. Moreover, the additional tool for simulating heterozygous genome is especially useful for applications that need heterozygous data.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><figDesc>Copyedited by: TRJ MANUSCRIPT CATEGORY: APPLICATIONS NOTE [15:40 11/5/2012 Bioinformatics-bts187.tex] Page: 1534 1533â€“1535 X.

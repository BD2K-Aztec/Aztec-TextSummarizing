				<p>Motivation: The problem of stationary metabolic flux analysis based on isotope labelling experiments first appeared in the early 1950s and was basically solved in early 2000s. Several algorithms and software packages are available for this problem. However, the generic stochastic algorithms (simulated annealing or evolution algorithms) currently used in these software require a lot of time to achieve acceptable precision. For deterministic algorithms, a common drawback is the lack of convergence stability for ill-conditioned systems or when started from a random point. Results: In this article, we present a new deterministic algorithm with significantly increased numerical stability and accuracy of flux estimation compared with commonly used algorithms. It requires relatively short CPU time (from several seconds to several minutes with a standard PC architecture) to estimate fluxes in the central carbon metabolism network of Escherichia coli. Availability: The software package influx_s implementing this algorithm is distributed under an OpenSource licence at http:// metasys.insa-toulouse.fr/software/influx/</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Metabolic flux analysis (MFA) aims at quantifying the actual rates of biochemical reactions occurring in living cells. In recent decades, MFA has been increasingly used to identify novel metabolic pathways (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Fischer and</ref><ref type="bibr">Sauer, 2003, Peyraud et al., 2009</ref>), for indepth understanding of metabolism (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Nicolas et al., 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">, Perrenoud and Sauer, 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, Sauer et al., 2004</ref>). It is extensively used in biotechnology to improve the metabolic properties of industrially relevant organisms (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Becker et al., 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, van Gulik et al., 2000</ref>). More recently, MFA has been successfully integrated with other omics tools (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc.) to obtain novel biological insights through systems biology (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Ishii et al., 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">, Lemuth et al., 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, Shimizu, 2004</ref>). The growing interest in MFA underlines the importance of developing reliable tools. The present contribution particularly addresses the need for accurate and stable algorithms for solving * To whom correspondence should be addressed. the least-squares problem that underlies the calculation of fluxes in MFA. In a stationary metabolic system, the biochemical reactions which occur in a cell can be described by the following stoichiometric linear equation:</p><formula>Sv = 0</formula><p>where S is m×n stoichiometric matrix, m rows and n columns correspond to the number of metabolites and reactions, respectively, v is the vector of all net fluxes. Each component of the vector v expresses a net flux, i.e. the net quantity of material converted by a particular reaction per time unit. The whole equation system expresses the mass conservation law in the metabolic system. At metabolic (quasi-)steady-state, the intracellular concentrations of metabolites are kept constant. For most metabolic systems, the stoichiometry matrix S is underdetermined, i.e. the number of equations m is lower than the number of fluxes n. Some fluxes can be measured experimentally. This is generally true of input and output fluxes, but is usually not enough to allow the calculations of all fluxes in the system. The remaining degrees of freedom, so-called free fluxes, need additional equations to be calculated. This can be achieved using different approaches. For example, flux balance analysis (FBA) requires maximization of some linear cost function like biomass yield (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Edwards et al., 2001</ref>). In the approaches using isotope labelling experiments (ILE) discussed in this article, additional relationships between fluxes come from the measurement of the labelling patterns (or isotopomer distributions) of selected metabolites. Currently, these measurements can be made by mass spectrometry (mass isotopomers) or by Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (positional isotopomers). The MFA-ILE approach was developed in the 1950s when 14 C radioactive isotopes were used to elucidate fragments of carbon metabolism in rat liver (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Strisower et al., 1951</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">, Weinman et al., 1950</ref>). Since the 1980s–1990s, a stable isotope 13 C has preferably been used instead of the radioactive 14 C. For many years, the equations describing the label distribution in a given metabolic network and their solution were derived by hand (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Heath, 1968</ref>). In the early 1990s, general mathematical descriptions of the labelling problem were introduced (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Schuster et al., 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Wiechert, 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">, Zupke and Stephanopoulos, 1994</ref>). This generalization led to a need to solve algebraic systems of high dimensions (often ill-conditioned) to find the labelling state of a given metabolic network. This paved the way for the intensive use of applied mathematics in the MFA field.<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Wiechert et al. (1999)</ref>introduced a variable change based on the cumomer (cumulated isotopomer) concept. This approach allowed a large non-linear system to be decomposed into a cascade of smaller linear problems, one per cumomer weight and thus greatly simplified the computational needs for labelling state calculations. A general software exploiting the cumomer approach 13CFlux was then published, which provides flux estimation based on all types of labelling data (mass and positional isotopomers) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Wiechert et al., 2001</ref>).<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Antoniewicz et al. (2007)</ref>proposed another variable change based on elementary metabolite unit (EMU) concept. The EMU framework is based on an efficient decomposition of an atom transition network, which identifies the minimum amount of information needed to simulate the experimental data without any loss of information. This led to a significant reduction in the dimension of the labelling problem. As a consequence, the computation of labelling variables now requires much less time and memory. A software based on EMUs, called OpenFlux, is now available (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Quek et al., 2009</ref>). A comparable gain in the computation of cumomers was announced by<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Weitzel et al. (2007)</ref>. These authors showed that often a highly dimensional linear system describing cumomers of a given weight can be decomposed into series of smaller linear subsystems corresponding to so-called strongly connected components (SCCs). To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no publicly available software exploiting this approach. For a more complete review of recent progress in MFA-ILE, including both experimental and mathematical improvements, see<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Tang et al. (2009)</ref>. The EMU and SCC concepts led to computational gains by improving the mathematical formulation of the labelling data problem involved in residue calculation. Another potential source of improvement is the optimization process, i.e. the iterative process by which the simulated labelling data are fitted to the experimental data. The two steps—i.e. residue calculation and optimization—of the flux calculation process are independent, and can be improved separately. It is likely that future software will combine the most efficient solutions for each calculation step. Here, we present an original deterministic algorithm called non-linear least squares with inequality constraints (NLSIC) with its improved optimization process. It solves MFA-ILE problems with good convergence robustness without sacrificing convergence speed. NLSIC also enhances the numerical accuracy of a final solution. Moreover, it did not suffer from the local minima problem in the cases we had at hand. We discuss this aspect in the Section 5. In this article, the performance of the NLSIC algorithm is illustrated by solving a MFA-ILE problem. But this algorithm can be advantageously applied to a larger framework of non-linear leastsquares problems with inequality constraints. The NLSIC algorithm is particularly suited to solve constrained least-squares problems with ill-conditioned or even rank-deficient Jacobian. We start with the formulation of the mathematical problem in MFA-ILE. We then describe the NLSIC algorithm and its practical implementation for flux estimation. The influx_s software is further validated in the numerical section by comparing its performance to that of several other algorithms available in the widely used 13CFlux software package. For this purpose, the different algorithms were applied to publicly available data from<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Zamboni et al. (2009</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">PROBLEM FORMULATION</head><p>In this section, we use the same conventions and notations as in<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Möllney et al. (1999</ref><ref type="bibr">Möllney et al. ( ), Wiechert et al. (1999</ref>. The free fluxes and free scaling parameters in a given metabolic system can be estimated using a least-squares problem that can be written as follows:</p><formula>argmin ,ω T (,ω) =||F w ()−w|| 2 w +||F y (,ω)−y|| 2 y (1)</formula><p>Here T is a cost function representing the sum of squared weighted errors. Its arguments, a free flux vector and ω a free scale vector, are the free parameters that are adjusted during the minimization process. Vectors w and y are the vectors of measured fluxes and labelling data, respectively, whereas vector functions F w and F y represent the data simulations matching measured values w and y. Matrices w and y are covariance matrices characterizing the experimental noise in flux and labelling data, respectively. They are often assumed to be diagonal as the noise is expected to be uncorrelated. The solution of (1) must satisfy linear inequality constraints</p><formula>U ω ≥ c (2)</formula><p>where U is an inequality matrix which is multiplied by a compound vector of free parameters and ω, c is a right-hand side vector. Inequalities express some biological conditions which might not be naturally respected by solving the unconstrained problem (1). These conditions can include the unidirectionality of some reactions, or the existence of lower or upper bounds for the flux values, and so on. Compared with the original cumomer formulation (<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Wiechert et al., 1999</ref>), the main difference consists in using a reduced cumomer set in simulations F y (,ω). Usually, simulations are performed with the entire set of isotopomers allowed by the network. But in most cases, the full set of cumomers is not needed to simulate the experimental data. To reduce the number of cumomers to be calculated, the network is read starting from cumomers involved in simulated data. Then, upstream the fluxes, all the precursor cumomers, up to the input ones, are added to the minimum set. This technique can result in a significant reduction in the number of cumomers to be simulated and, hence, in the calculation time. A similar idea was proposed in the EMU framework (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Antoniewicz et al., 2007</ref>). For example, for a network of Escherichia coli described in Section 5, the total number of cumomers in the complete model was 3183, whereas it was only 2271 in the reduced model. The number of cumomers of weight 1 remains unchanged but a significant reduction is obtained for all other weights (Supplementary Material 1). The complexity of solving a dense linear system is O(n 3 ) where n is the problem size. The theoretical speedup in the cumomer calculations for the above-mentioned example is n 3 full //n 3 reduced ≈ 2.8 where the sum involves the problem sizes of all cumomer weights present in the system. The savings are highly dependent on the network and on the measurements concerned. The greatest reduction in the total number of cumomers is expected for the simulation of positional labelling data where only cumomers of weight 1 are used. So all cumomers of higher weights can be excluded from the simulations without loss of information. For the sake of simplicity, and without loss of generality, we omit writing vector ω in the free parameter vector. We also omit the matrices w and y. So, from now on, denotes the whole vectorand searching for a vector p that minimizes the norm ||r(+p)||, a linearized incremental form of the problem in the point is obtained:</p><formula>Jp =−r Up ≥ c−U (3)</formula><p>where the new variable vector p is an unknown correction to the current free parameter vector and the equality sign must be interpreted in the least-squares sense. This linear problem is hereafter referred to as least-squares with inequalities (LSI).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">NLSIC ALGORITHM</head><p>Generally, non-linear, unconstrained optimization problems like (1) can be solved using a wide range of methods which are well described in text books. These methods can be divided into two classes: stochastic and deterministic algorithms. Among the most frequently cited deterministic algorithms are gradient descent, conjugate gradient, Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno optimization algorithm (BFGS). To deal with inequality constraints, the deterministic algorithms have to be used in conjunction with appropriate techniques, e.g. interior point methods like barrier function or active set. Non-linearity is most often treated using a classical line search approach, sequential quadratic programming (SQP) or a combination of the two approaches. Finally, techniques which are widely used to make these algorithms globally converge, i.e. independent of the distance between the starting point and the convergence point, are trust region and backtracking. All these algorithm aspects—non-linearity, inequalities, globalization and stopping criterion—are detailed hereafter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Non linearity</head><p>The non-linearity approach in the NLSIC algorithm is close to the classical SQP method. The latter solves a normal (square) linear system at each iteration:</p><formula>Hp =−J T r</formula><p>where H is a matrix proportional to Hessian, i.e. the matrix of second partial derivatives of the cost function T</p><formula>H ij = (J T J) ij + k ∂ 2 r k ∂∂ i ∂∂ j r k</formula><p>or more frequently H is taken to be just J T J; while in the NLSIC algorithm, a least-squares problem with rectangular matrix J is solved Jp =−r.</p><formula>(4)</formula><p>This point is crucial for numerical stability and precision even if its numerical cost is higher than solving the normal system. In real-world problems, like in MFA-ILE, the Jacobian J is often ill-conditioned, i.e. κ(J) 1 (here κ is a condition number) so that the condition of J T J will be even worse. For example, in</p><formula>l 2-norm κ(J T J) = κ(J) 2. If κ(J)</formula><p>is say 10 7 , the problem (4) can still be solved in double precision arithmetics with satisfactory precision; whereas the corresponding normal system has κ(J T J) as high as 10 14 and will be considered as numerically singular. It is also well known that the matrix condition is a determining factor for convergence stability and for the precision of many numerical methods. By solving a system with matrix J instead of H, condition deterioration is avoided and hence numerical stability and precision are preserved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Inequalities</head><p>The presence of inequalities makes the optimization problem more difficult from a numerical point of view. Like for SQP (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Liu, 2005</ref>), for NLSIC, an active set method was chosen to deal with inequalities. As an overdetermined linear system has to be solved at each non-linear iteration, one particular method called non-negative least squares (NNLS) suits this purpose well (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Lawson and Hanson, 1974</ref>). To reduce the LSI problem to an NNLS problem, an intermediate problem called LDP has to be formulated as detailed hereafter. Let us start by formulating an NNLS problem. Given a rectangular m×n matrix A and right-hand side vector b of size m, find a vector x of size n such that x i ≥ 0, ∀i. In short:</p><formula>Ax = b x i ≥ 0, ∀i (5)</formula><p>here again, the equality sign must be interpreted in the least-squares sense. The NNLS algorithm solves this problem by combining QR decomposition (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Björck, 1996</ref>) of the matrix A with an active set method. One attractive feature of this algorithm is that QR decomposition is not recalculated each time a new active set is tried. Only those elements of matrices Q and R that are affected by changes in the active set, are updated. Another feature worth mentioning is that an appropriate active set is rapidly found in only a few iterations, at least in the problems we had to deal with. An interface to this algorithm in R language is available under OpenSource licence (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nnls/). It can be shown that an NNLS problem can be set as a reformulation of another so-called least distance programming (LDP) problem (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Lawson and Hanson, 1974</ref>). An LDP problem is formulated in the following way: find a vector z of smallest norm l 2 satisfying a set of inequalities</p><formula>Ez ≥ f (6)</formula><p>Copyedited by: ES</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S.Sokol et al.</head><p>where E and f are any real rectangular matrix and vector of appropriate sizes, respectively. Given an LDP problem, an equivalent NNLS problem can be obtained by setting</p><formula>A = E T f T b = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ 0 .. . 0 1 ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠</formula><p>Once NNLS is solved for x, a residual vector v = Ax −b is calculated and the solution for LDP is given by</p><formula>z i =− v i v n+1</formula><p>, for i = 1,...,n. The case v n+1 = 0 corresponds to infeasible inequality constraints (6). In turn, the LDP solution can be used to address the LSI problem (3). To reduce the problem (3) to (6), the following variable change is performed</p><formula>z = Rp+Q T r</formula><p>where Q and R are components of QR decomposition of the Jacobian J = QR. We then put</p><formula>E = UR −1 f = c−U(−R −1 Q T r).</formula><p>Once LDP with E and f is solved for z, a vector p can be calculated as p = R −1 (z −Q T r). It can happen that during iterations the Jacobian becomes rank deficient. In this case, we provide an option to continue iterations with an approximate least norm solution. A strict least norm solution always exists and is unique if the inequalities are feasible. A description of the method chosen to obtain an approximate least norm solution for p satisfying inequality constrains is beyond the scope of this article. Interested readers can refer to the source code of the function lsi_ln() in the file nlsic.R distributed with the influx_s software. To summarize, starting from the LSI problem, an equivalent LDP problem is formulated which in turn is reformulated as an NNLS problem. Having solved NNLS, we go backwards in the same way: first the solution for LDP and then the solution for the original LSI problem are calculated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Globalization</head><p>The last but not least component of the NLSIC algorithm is the use of a backtracking algorithm to ensure the global convergence of the non-linear iterations. The backtracking was derived and successfully used to solve systems of non-linear equations and later for non-linear unconstrained optimization (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Dennis and Schnabel, 1996</ref>). The key idea behind this method is to iteratively shorten a candidate vector p if at some point the norm ||r(+p)|| is much higher than predicted by the linear model norm ||r()+Jp||. If r is differentiable in the neighbourhood of , a sufficiently small vector p can always be found such that two norms are close enough. Backtracking ensures that the increment vector p remains in the validity domain of linear approximation (3), and hence ensures the norm ||r()|| is reduced during non-linear iterations. Near the solution, where the first value of p found is sufficiently small to satisfy backtracking</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Algorithm 1 NLSIC</head><p>1. Set initial values i := 0, 0 2. Solve LSI problem J i p i =−r i subject to Up i ≥ c−U i 3. If ||p i || is sufficiently small or the limit of iteration number is reached, stop iterations with := i +p i 4. While backtracking condition (7) is not satisfied or maximal number of backtrack iterations is reached, iteratively set p i := αp i with 0 &lt;α&lt;1 5. Set i+1 = i +p i 6. Set i := i+1 and restart with p. 2. conditions, a very rapid convergence of Newton-like methods is often observed. More formally, the backtracking method consists in iteratively setting p := αp with some positive constant α&lt;1 until the following backtrack condition is fulfilled ||r(+p)||≤||r()||+βr T Jp</p><formula>(7)</formula><p>with some constant 0 &lt;β&lt;1. Parameters α and β are chosen a priori by the user. As the original backtracking method was designed to be used in an unconstrained context, it is necessary to check that it can be used in the context of inequality constraints. This is easy to do by observing that if two vectors and p are such that and +p satisfy the inequalities, i.e. U ≥ c and U(+p) ≥ c then by multiplying both inequalities by positive numbers (1−α) and α respectively and summing them, we obtain U(+αp) ≥ c. This means that for any α, the intermediate vector of backtracking iterations +αp cannot leave the feasibility domain delimited by the inequalities. As mentioned above, due to backtracking, the sequence of norms ||r( i )|| monotonously decreases. This sequence has a low bound 0, and is hence necessarily convergent. This guarantees that the whole NLSIC algorithm is globally convergent under the assumption that there is no significant problem due to finite precision arithmetics. Strictly speaking, the convergence point may differ from the global minimum but achieving convergence independently of the starting point is already appreciable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Stopping criterion</head><p>The stopping criterion in NLSIC is based on the norm of the correction vector p and not on the variation of the cost function T as it is usually the case. This point is important for ill-conditioned systems, as relatively big correction vectors sometimes produce very small variations in cost function. In this situation, the error control based on T variations could stop iterations relatively far from the solution. In practice, this could be mistakenly interpreted as falling in a local minimum. In a nutshell, the NLSIC algorithm can be classified as a sequential LSI algorithm (based on NNLS) with backtracking globalization.(<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Wiechert et al., 2001</ref>). A module of influx_s package parsing input file and generating an executable code is written in Python (http://python.org). The executable program calculating flux estimations (specific to each network) is automatically generated in R language (http://www.r-project.org). The NLSIC algorithm is also programmed in R. As it is an interpreted language, for the sake of calculation speed, the most time consuming linear algebra operations: QR and LU decompositions, NNLS algorithm and so on, are programmed in FORTRAN and C in several third part software distributed independently of influx_s. A small part of the influx_s package concerning sparse matrix updates is written in FORTRAN. This part of the executable code is compiled only once and is not regenerated for every new network input. The use of sparse matrices (http://cran .r-project.org/web/packages/Matrix/) greatly reduces memory and CPU requirements, especially in the case of large networks which are transformed into huge matrices. Third part software used by NLSIC is indicated in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>in grey boxes. For the sake of rigorous simulations, an option to include the growth flux μM into the stoichiometric balance is provided. Even if its inclusion does not have a major impact on the final results in most common situations (data not shown), users can themselves check that this is true in their own case. It should be noted that this option requires absolute concentrations for intracellular metabolites, which may be not very easy to measure. Confidence intervals of the free and dependent fluxes can be assessed using two methods in influx_s: by linearized statistics as proposed in<ref type="bibr">Möllney et al. (1999)</ref>or by Monte Carlo simulations. The latter is programmed for parallel execution on multi-core architecture where a third part R package multicore is available. The influx_s software was developed and tested as a command line tool on a Linux platform but potentially it can be run on any platform where Python and R are installed. At the time of writing, the multicore package is not stable enough on Windows platforms and consequently, until a stable version is available, users will have to run such simulations on a single core on their Windows platform. The package influx_s is available at http://metasys.insa-toulouse.fr/software/influx/ under OpenSource licence. All third part libraries used in our software are also freely available at their respective sources.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">NUMERICAL RESULTS</head><p>In this section, a publicly available FTBL file Ecoli.ftbl from Supplementary Material 3 of<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Zamboni et al. (2009)</ref>was used to compare the NLSIC algorithm implemented in the influx_s software with the three optimization algorithms used in the 13CFlux software (v20050329): Evolution, BFGS and donlp2 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Spellucci, 1993</ref>). The 13Cflux software is widely distributed throughout the biological community concerned with MFA and, in the last decade, has become de facto reference method for flux calculations. The file Ecoli.ftbl describes a central metabolic network of the bacterium E. coli. The network includes central carbon metabolism (glycolysis, gluconeogenic reactions, pentose phosphate pathways, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, glyoxylate shunt and anaplerotic reactions) and reactions for amino acid biosynthesis. It contains 35 internal metabolites, 68 reactions (of which 16 are reversible and 52 are not reversible). The labelling data includes 193 isotopomer measurements obtained only by gas chromatography– mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Free parameters were composed of 27 free fluxes and 35 scale parameters. The GC-MS data provided in the FTBL file are not sufficient to determine all free fluxes. So the network is structurally undefined. This leads to rank-deficient Jacobian. So the least norm solution (available in influx_s with an option-ln) that we discussed in Section 3.2, was revealed to be indispensable in this situation. Another problem encountered with this FTBL file was that cumomer balance matrix could become singular when some fluxes vanished to 0. To prevent this happening, the net fluxes over non-reversible reactions were constrained to be over 10 −4 with an option-clownr=1e-4. To compare various algorithms, a suite of 10 FTBL files was generated. These files differed only in their random starting points while the network and measurement sections remained the same. Initial flux values were uniformly drawn from<ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr">1]</ref>interval and the resulting vector was projected on the feasibility domain by solving an LDP problem. As the Evolution algorithm implemented in 13CFlux does not include a stopping criterion, it was run for a fixed time of 3 h on each input file and the results achieved at this time (and corresponding to the best fit) are shown. The stopping criterion for BFGS and donlp2 algorithms were those set by default in 13CFlux software. The running time for these two algorithms were limited to 15 min. The BFGS algorithms was often stalled at this time, and donp2 stopped before reaching the time limit. The NLSIC algorithm was stopped when the norm ||p|| was lower than 10 −5 or the upper limit on the non-linear iteration number (50) was reached. All numerical experiments were run on a laptop with 1 GHz bi-core processor (actually only one core was used) and 2 GB of RAM.<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>shows box-plots representing the spread of the final cost values for the four methods applied to 10 different starting points and the three deterministic methods: BFGS, donlp2 and NLSIC when they followed the results of the Evolution method. The double algorithm such as a stochastic algorithm followed by a deterministic algorithm is sometimes recommended (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Zamboni et al., 2009</ref>the BFGS and donlp2 methods could be interpreted as local minima in which the convergence was trapped, in fact this was not the case. Since using the final results of, for example, the Evolution or BFGS algorithms as starting point for NLSIC, it continued convergence until it reached the previously found solution, 127. The network was not well defined by the data that were provided, so almost all fluxes are statistically undetermined.<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Zamboni et al. (2009)</ref>had to constrain 21 of 27 free fluxes to be able to evaluate the confidence intervals of the remaining fluxes. Of all the free fluxes in the original (not constrained) FTBL file, only the uptake flux was statistically determined. In<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 3</ref>, the box-plots corresponding to this flux are shown for all algorithms tested. Ideally, this value as well as the final cost should not depend on the starting points. When this happens, for example with the Evolution, BFGS and donlp2 algorithms, this numerical instability adds to already present experimental noise and reduces the quality of flux assessment. The NLSIC algorithm was almost free of this drawback as can be seen in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 3</ref>. A word about calculation times.<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Zamboni et al. (2009)</ref>estimated the time necessary for flux calculation using 13CFlux software to be 1 day. This time included several runs of the Evolution algorithm, optionally followed by some deterministic algorithm(s) and choosing the lowest final cost value of all the runs. In the example given here, NLSIC ran only for several minutes and provided a better minimum, 127, than the 132 found by the authors of the above-cited paper. By considerably shortening the calculation time, our software represents an additional step in the direction of high-throughput flux calculation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSION</head><p>We developed an algorithm for solving NLSIC, which was used to solve the MFA-ILE problem. In this field, it outperformed widely used algorithms such as BFGS, donlp2 or Evolution algorithms not only in numerical stability but also in the accuracy of the solution. The increased numerical accuracy led us to conclude that a problem of local minima, as often mentioned in the literature dedicated to MFA-ILE, could in some cases be a false problem. Probably, it was lack of precision in convergence which was interpreted as trapping in a local minimum. The significantly improved computer efficiency, accuracy and reliability of influx_s makes the MFA-ILE approach more accessible for a wide biological community interested in fluxomics. We can reasonably expect that the NLSIC algorithm will also provide the same benefits in future MFA-ILE developments dealing with the dynamics of labelling propagation in metabolically stable networks. The software influx_s implementing NLSIC in the MFA-ILE context is distributed under OpenSource licence. It has the same general character and input format as 13CFlux software as it can take into account all types of labelling data coming both from MS and NMR.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><figDesc>Input data for the MFA-ILE problem, i.e. metabolic network, carbon transitions in reactions and measurements are all supplied in a plain text file.

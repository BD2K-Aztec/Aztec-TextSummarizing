				<p>Motivation: The reliable detection of genomic variation in resequencing data is still a major challenge, especially for variants larger than a few base pairs. Sequencing reads crossing boundaries of structural variation carry the potential for their identification, but are difficult to map. Results: Here we present a method for &apos;split&apos; read mapping, where prefix and suffix match of a read may be interrupted by a longer gap in the read-to-reference alignment. We use this method to accurately detect medium-sized insertions and long deletions with precise breakpoints in genomic resequencing data. Compared with alternative split mapping methods, SplazerS significantly improves sensitivity for detecting large indel events, especially in variant-rich regions. Our method is robust in the presence of sequencing errors as well as alignment errors due to genomic mutations/divergence, and can be used on reads of variable lengths. Our analysis shows that SplazerS is a versatile tool applicable to unanchored or single-end as well as anchored paired-end reads. In addition, application of SplazerS to targeted resequencing data led to the interesting discovery of a complete, possibly functional gene retrocopy variant. Availability: SplazerS is available from http://www.seqan.de/ projects/ splazers.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have had huge impact on the study of molecular biology (<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Metzker, 2010</ref>): ultra high-throughput NGS technologies provide excellent means for analyzing RNA content of a cell (<ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Wang et al., 2009</ref>), resequencing whole genomes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bentley et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">McKernan et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Wheeler et al., 2008</ref>) and detecting, for example, disease-causing variants (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chen et al., 2008</ref>) or investigating the epigenetic state of a cell (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Barski et al., 2007</ref>). There is a long list of biological applications and, accordingly, a high demand for specialized * To whom correspondence should be addressed. bioinformatics tools for the analyses. Due to the tremendous data yield, this constitutes a great challenge to computational biology. One of the most fundamental tasks is read mapping, i.e. determining the origin of the sequenced reads in a reference genome. All further analysis is based on the mapped reads, e.g. genomic variants are identified or transcript expression is quantified. Reads containing more than a few variant base pairs with respect to a reference will be hard to map, and sequencing errors further complicate this task. While a large part of human genomic variation is due to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), recent years have shown that insertion/deletion (indel) variants dramatically contribute to genomic diversity (<ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Mullaney et al., 2010</ref>). Furthermore, they have been linked to many diseases (<ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Stenson et al., 2009</ref>), and especially large indels have been shown to have strong structural and functional impact (<ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Stankiewicz and Lupski, 2010</ref>). The first high-throughput method for genome-wide detection of large deletions and duplications was array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) where sample and reference DNA are competitively hybridized on a probe array (<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Pinkel and Albertson, 2005</ref>). Given steadily decreasing costs, sequencing approaches are likely to gradually replace aCGH methods, since they carry the potential to provide base pair resolution and identify novel insertions while generating less measurement noise. Sequencing-based indel detection methods are based on different strategies often utilizing paired-end or mate-pair sequencing data. One conclusion from the 1000 Genomes Project so far is, that a comprehensive indel detection method needs to make use of different detection strategies as no strategy alone is sufficient (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Durbin et al., 2010</ref>). We will briefly introduce the different strategies and point to their strengths and weaknesses. Most prominently, strategies based on paired-end or mate-pair data make use of the approximate distance and relative orientation of read pairs. Shifts in the mapped distance or changes in relative orientation indicate indel events or also more complex structural variation. Examples for popular methods that address indel detection based on abnormal insert sizes are PEMer (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Korbel et al., 2009</ref>), BreakDancer (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chen et al., 2009</ref>), MoDIL (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lee et al., 2009</ref>) and SVDetect (<ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Zeitouni et al., 2010</ref>). A drawback of these read pair methods is that they require tight insert size distributions for accurate discovery of small-to medium-sized indels and for confident localization of breakpoints (<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Medvedev et al., 2009</ref>). Socalled anchored split read mapping addresses this shortcoming by<ref type="bibr">[</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.-K.Emde et al.</head><p>directly taking advantage of reads crossing a breakpoint. In split read mapping, the 5 and 3 match of a read may be interrupted by a longer gap in the read-to-reference alignment enabling detection of the exact breakpoint and size of the indel.<ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Ye et al. (2009)</ref>first applied this approach to short NGS read data. Their tool, Pindel, builds on the availability of paired-end reads, split mapping the unmapped but anchored end within a genomic region defined by its confidently mapped paired end. Pindel is based on a pattern growth algorithm, combining unique 5 and 3 matches into a split read match. Detecting large indels in single-end or unanchored reads is more challenging, due to the short read length and to the repetitiveness of genomic DNA (especially in higher organisms such as human). Read depth methods (<ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Xie and Tammi, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Yoon et al., 2009</ref>) work on single-end as well as paired-end data and are able to detect very large deletions and duplications, i.e. changes in copy number, by comparing the observed number of mapped reads in a genomic region to the expected one. These methods provide no exact breakpoints due to low resolution and suffer from artifactual read depth fluctuations. However, as read lengths increase with advances in sequencing technology, single reads provide the potential for identifying large indels through split-read alignment. In this work, we will use singleend and unanchored reads as short as 76 bp to predict large deletions up to several kilobases in size with high confidence. Similar to Pindel, our tool SplazerS employs a split read approach. However, it uses a more sensitive alignment method for prefix and suffix matches, allowing for mismatches and small gaps, thereby making it more robust in the presence of small genomic variation and sequencing errors. Especially, read suffixes require higher error tolerance, as sequencing error rates tend to increase toward the 3' ends of reads. Most notably, SplazerS implements a fast anchored as well as a more general unanchored/single-end alignment mode, making it applicable to paired-end as well as single-end sequencing data. Another tool for split read alignment is GSNAP (<ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Wu and Nacu, 2010</ref>), which indexes every third 12mer in the genome and then maps reads one after the other by searching for exact 12mer matches. It does not provide support for anchored split read mapping or for subsequent indel detection. Also BWA (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Li and Durbin, 2009</ref>), a popular multi-purpose read mapping tool based on a BurrowsWheeler index, provides split read mapping functionality to a certain extent. Further methods such as SpliceMap (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Au et al., 2010</ref>), MapSplice (<ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Wang et al., 2010</ref>) or SplitSeek (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ameur et al., 2010</ref>) follow similar approaches but are geared toward splice junction discovery in RNA-Seq data. Typical drawbacks of these methods for indel detection are a lack of functionality for insertion detection, or their requirement for donor/acceptor splicing patterns. Our method is novel in that it supports both Hamming (ungapped) and edit (gapped) alignment in the 5 and 3 matches, making it applicable to reads from different sequencing technologies. Also longer and variable read lengths as expected from upcoming sequencing technologies (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Eid et al., 2009</ref>) can be handled. It does not require the prefix or suffix of minimum length to be unique, but attempts to align the entire read while identifying the best split position. It can furthermore report multiple and also suboptimal matches if they exist. SplazerS can be used to split-align short reads to candidate regions as in anchored split read mapping, and is also able to directly align single-end reads to an entire genome where stricter parameter settings may be desired. For fine-tuning of small indel detection, the mapping results can be used in conjunction with arbitrary indel detection methods supporting the SAM format, such as Dindel (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Albers et al., 2010</ref>) or GATK (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">McKenna et al., 2010</ref>). Split-mapped reads can also be combined with SAM output from other mapping steps, for example 'normally' mapped reads where small indels were already allowed. We apply our method to real paired-end data and to simulated and real single-end data and demonstrate its high precision and high sensitivity, even in challenging, variant-rich regions. We additionally use paired-end data in single-end mode to show how prediction accuracy can be increased even further when considering unanchored reads. In addition, we will show how application of SplazerS led to the interesting discovery of a retrocopy of PQBP1, a gene which has been shown to be involved in X-linked intellectual disability (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kalscheuer et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lenski et al., 2004</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">METHODS</head><p>We first want to give some basic notation: we have a set of reads R where r ∈ R and a reference sequence g, where r and g are sequences over the alphabet {A,C,G,T,N}. Furthermore, the operator |·| denotes the length of a sequence. Given an alignment a g i,j r k,l of the subsequence of read r starting in position k and ending in position l to the subsequence of g starting in i and ending in j, we define an error function d(a g i,j r k,l ) that returns the number of errors in the alignment, i.e. the sum of the number of gaps and mismatches. Any character aligned with an 'N' is counted as an alignment error. The error rate is then given by = d(a g i,j r k,l )/(l −k +1), i.e. the number of alignment errors divided by the length of the read subsequence. For the sake of clarity, we will drop the superscript and refer to alignments as a r k,l instead of a g i,j r k,l .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Definition of split read alignment</head><p>We want to identify collinear split read alignments, i.e. alignments that are split into a prefix (5 ) and suffix (3 ) match that lie within a collinear genomic subsequence W.l.o.g. we assume our reads to only match to the forward strand, and define a split read alignment of read r as an alignment where the following holds:</p><p>(1) a (non-empty) prefix p of r aligns to g i,j</p><p>(2) a (non-empty) suffix s of r aligns to g k,l</p><p>(3) |p|+|s|=|r| and j +1 &lt; k (read spans a deletion) or |p|+|s| &lt; |r| and j +1 = k (read spans an insertion)</p><p>where 1 ≤ i ≤ j &lt; k ≤ l ≤|g|. A valid split read alignment (or split read match) is one that additionally fulfills the following criteria:</p><p>(1) |p|≥m and |s|≥m</p><formula>(2) d(a p 1,m ) ≤ e p and d(a s |s|−m+1,|s| ) ≤ e s (3) d(ap)+d(as) |p|+|s| ≤ (4) k −j −1 ≤ δ</formula><p>The first condition ensures that prefix and suffix have at least a certain minimum match length m. The second condition ensures that the number of errors in the minimum length prefix (suffix) match is at most a certain maximum number e p (e s ). Condition 3 guarantees that the sum of the number of errors in the prefix and suffix match divided by the combined length of prefix and suffix lies within the allowed error rate. The maximum gap length δ puts a constraint on the distance of prefix and suffix match. An example of a valid and an invalid split read match is given in<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.is a valid alignment spanning a deletion and (B) spans an insertion but is not a valid match as the error rate condition is violated. the read length, adjusting the allowed numbers of errors for reads of variable length. For valid anchored split read matches, we further restrict the genomic region that the read is allowed to map to. This region is defined by the location of the confidently mapped paired end and the expected insert size. To find such valid split read alignments, we use the following algorithm which we have implemented in SplazerS—in reference to the related general purpose read mapper RazerS (<ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Weese et al., 2009</ref>)—using the SeqAn library (<ref type="bibr">Döring et al., 2008</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Mapping algorithm</head><p>The input to our algorithm is a set of reads (either in Fasta/Fastq format or, for anchored split mapping, in single-chromosome SAM format) and a reference sequence (in Fasta format). The output file will contain the successfully splitmapped reads in GFF or SAM format.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>outlines the main steps of the algorithm. A filtering method identifies potential prefix/suffix matches, i.e. match candidates (filtering phase,<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2A</ref>). Possible match candidates are verified with a seed-and-extend alignment method (match verification,<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig.  2B</ref>) and, if successful, combined into split read matches (match combination,<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig.2C</ref>). The following describes these steps in detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Double-swift filtering identifies potential matches</head><p>Our filtering phase is based on counting q-gram matches (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Burkhardt et al., 1999</ref>), i.e. identifying short subsequences of length q that is shared between read and reference. We build two indices: the left index containing all q-grams of all read prefixes of length m, and the right index containing all qgrams of all read suffixes of length m. Employing the SWIFT filtering algorithm (<ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Rasmussen et al., 2005</ref>), we start scanning the reference sequence with the right index. Whenever a potential suffix match region for a read r is encountered, i.e. a certain minimum number of matching q-grams have been observed within a defined region of the genome, the left index is 'dragged' behind, up to the current position of the right index. Potential prefix matches within the allowed distance, as defined by parameter δ, are recorded in a queue. If there is at least one potential prefix match for r within the allowed distance, this triggers the verification of the potential suffix match of r.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Prefix and suffix matches are verified separately</head><p>Only if the suffix match is verified positively, the potential prefix matches are also subjected to verification. In order to avoid having to verify a potential prefix match several times, the filtering queue keeps track of the verification status of each potential prefix match. We verify potential prefix/suffix matches using either a simple scanning of diagonals in the alignment matrix for ungapped alignment, or using Myers' Bit Vector algorithm (<ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Myers, 1999</ref>) in the case of edit distance. Verification is done only for the prefix/suffix of length m. A positively verified prefix/suffix match is then extended using either ungappedor gapped X-drop extension, extending the match as far as possible within the allowed overall error rate .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3">Prefix and suffix matches are combined to identify optimal breakpoint location</head><p>Whenever a prefix match a p and a suffix match a s are to be combined into a split read match, we first check whether the basic criteria defined in the previous section can be fulfilled. We make use of the fact that a p and a s have been extended as far as possible, collecting the maximum total number of errors allowed on the whole read. Therefore, if extended prefix and suffix match would indicate a deletion but together do not cover the entire read sequence, i.e. j +1 &lt; k and |p|+|s| &lt; |r|, then prefix p and suffix s are too short to be combined into a valid split read match. Also, if prefix and suffix match are too close to each other, i.e. l −i &lt; 2m (in the case of edit distance: l −i &lt; 2m−e p −e s ), then prefix and suffix cannot both fulfill the minimum match length and therefore cannot constitute a valid</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.-K.Emde et al.</head><p>split read match. By convention, the gap is placed to the leftmost position that yields the lowest sum of errors in the prefix and suffix match. Again, this is achieved by a simple scanning of diagonals in the case of Hamming distance. For edit distance, a banded alignment matrix is computed to identify the optimal combination of prefix and suffix match and thereby the optimal gap placement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Match scoring and ranking</head><p>Each match with a middle gap of length ≥1 receives a score sc =|p|+|s|− 2(d(a p )+d(a s ))−c(r), while matches without a middle gap, i.e. matches that map 'normally' and do not indicate an indel event, receive score sc = |p|+|s|−2(d(a p )+d(a s )). The parameter c(r) puts a penalty on the existence of a gap independent of its length and is set to 0.03×|r|| by default. It can be set individually, depending on the error-proneness of the reads. Matches with the same score are ranked according to the length of the middle gap (the shorter the better). By default, a match is tagged as unique if it is the single match with highest score. Uniqueness can be extended to a score range, i.e. discarding reads that have more than a certain number of matches within a range of the highest observed score. Multiple and also suboptimal matches can be reported.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Choice of mapping parameters</head><p>There are several parameters that influence our method. In most cases, the choice of the error rate and therefore also e p and e s is rather straightforward, depending mainly on the error pattern specific to the sequencing technology used and/or on the relatedness of sample and reference genome. The choice of parameters m and δ is mainly a matter of trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, as well as runtime. In order to aid the user in choosing sensible parameters, SplazerS provides in its verbose mode an estimate of the number of random matches one expects in a random sequence using the chosen parameter setting. To calculate these values, we use binomial statistics (see Supplementary Material S1). In the following results, we usually set = 0.05, m = 16 and e p = e s = 1 unless stated otherwise. The distance parameter δ will be set individually to values between 5000 and 50 000.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Indel detection</head><p>Once we have split-mapped a set of reads, we use all unique best matches to identify indel locations. For this purpose, we use the SeqAn tool snpStore (http://www.seqan.de/projects/snpStore). The indel calling procedure is mainly based on two thresholds: a minimum number and a minimum percentage of spanning reads that are required to support the indel candidate. Each pair of reference position and indel length observed in the mapped reads is considered an indel candidate. For reads that contradict an indel, a minimum overlap with the indel candidate position can be required.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>illustrates the concept. We usually require at least three indel-supporting reads, and a percentage of at least 25–50% of support from spanning reads where we consider only reads overlapping &gt;5% of their total length.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Evaluation data</head><p>All single-end-only evaluation analyses were conducted using NCBI build 36 of the human genome as reference sequence. The paired-end evaluation analysis uses NCBI build 37, as we use already mapped reads from the 1000 Genomes project. Furthermore, we use the variation databases dbSNP (<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Sherry et al., 2001</ref>) (version 130) and the Database of Genomic Variants (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Iafrate et al., 2004</ref>) (DGV indels version10). Details on used datasets and program calls are given in Supplementary Materials S2 and S4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.1">1000 Genomes Project data</head><p>We downloaded two files of Illumina reads for HapMap individual NA12878, available from the 1000 Genomes project page: one containing reads mapped/assigned to chromosome 22 and the other containing unmapped reads that could not be assigned to a chromosome. We extracted a subset of 76 bp reads accounting for ∼ 20× coverage and used all unmapped but anchored reads (∼ 1M) as input for Pindel (version 2.2) and SplazerS in paired-end mode. Additionally, we used a total of ∼ 40M unmapped 76 bp reads as input for SplazerS in singleend mode. For a fair comparison, we use the same cutoff as Pindel and thus require at least three indel-supporting reads. We furthermore require the indel-supporting reads to constitute at least 50% of reads spanning the putative indel coordinate. Again similar to Pindel's settings, we set SplazerS' maximum distance parameter such that deletions up to 8 kb can be detected. Details on program calls are given in the Supplementary Material S2. We compare the indel prediction results with two reference sets: (i) from the 1000 Genomes project (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Durbin et al., 2010</ref>) and (ii) from a recent Sanger sequencing study (<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mills et al., 2011b</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.2">Simulated single-end data</head><p>For the simulation of single-end reads (details given in Supplementary Material S4.1), we first generate a manipulated reference sequence by randomly choosing 1000 known indels from a reference set (dbSNP+DGV) and implanting them into human chromosome 21. Our sampling procedure does not represent a realistic indel distribution, but gives us sufficient sample size for testing different indel size ranges, in particular medium-to large-sized indels. Furthermore, we add single base substitutions at a rate of 0.001 to simulate SNPs. We then generate single-end reads from the manipulated chromosome, using the Mason read simulator (Holtgrewe, 2010) with typical Illumina sequencing error settings (position-specific error probabilities increasing from 5' to 3' end). We repeated this simulation procedure with different read lengths: 100, 125 and 150 bp. Simulated coverages are 5, 10 and 30×. After mapping the set of simulated reads onto the whole human reference genome with a 'normal' ungapped mapping approach<ref type="bibr">[RazerS (Weese et al., 2009</ref>) with 5% error rate], we retrieve all unmapped reads for subsequent split mapping. The unmapped reads are split-mapped with SplazerS and, for comparison, with GSNAP (version 2010-07-27) and BWA (version 0.5.8a). For all tools, only one gap of at most length δ = 5000 was allowed on each read. For BWA, we tested the 'log-scaled gap penalty for long deletions' feature, but achieved better results with the n-difference mode which we consequently use. We then use the same indel detection method for all three tools (snpStore, see Section 2.5), as it can detect indels of all size ranges. Only unique best hits are used for indel calling for GSNAP, and only hits with mapping quality &gt;0 are used for BWA. We set the indel detection method very sensitively: at least two reads and 25% of spanning reads are required to support the indel. Parametrization details and program calls are given in Supplementary Material S4.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.3">Real single-end data</head><p>We used our method in a large-scale targeted resequencing study of 248 male patients with X-linked intellectual disability collected by the EURO-MRX consortium (Kalscheuer,V.M. et al., manuscript in preparation). X chromosome exons were targeted by solution hybridization selection (SureSelect, Agilent) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Johnston et al., 2010</ref>). Purified, captured DNA was then PCR amplified and sequenced on the Solexa Genome Analyzer GAIIx, yielding single-end reads of length 76 bp.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Detecting genomic indels with exact breakpoints</head><p>were retrieved for mapping with SplazerS. This constituted a total of almost 1.5 billion unmapped reads (on average ∼6M per patient). With m = 23, split mapping was rather strict.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7.1">Indel comparison</head><p>Comparing a predicted indel with a reference indel is not trivial: indels, especially if located in a tandem repeat, can be placed at distances &gt;50 bp while still constituting the same basic indel event. For indel rectification, we adopt the computation of the extended indel region, as defined by Krawitz (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Krawitz et al., 2010</ref>), which accounts for repeats and gives a window of possible locations for each indel. Predicted indel size is allowed to vary by 10% of reference indel size in all real datasets, but has to be exactly the same as implanted indel size in the simulation experiments.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RESULTS</head><p>First, we will evaluate our method's ability to accurately identify and locate genomic indel variants in paired-end data, comparing SplazerS with Pindel. Then we will investigate whether our method is also able to accurately detect indels in the simulated single-end datasets, comparing results with GSNAP and BWA. Finally, we will demonstrate our method's capabilities on real large-scale single-end data from 248 patients, providing PCR validation for an especially interesting scenario of predicted indels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Paired-end sequencing data: anchored indel detection proves high sensitivity</head><p>The results for comparing indels predicted by SplazerS and Pindel on anchored paired-end reads are summarized in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. Since we use previously mapped reads from the 1000 Genomes Project webpage, a large part of the chromosome is already covered by reads mapped also with small indels. Thus, our detected indels do not constitute the whole set of chromosome 22 indels, but rather additional ones discovered through split mapping. Using anchored reads only, the SplazerS approach yielded a total of 392 indel calls, 301 (76.8%) of which are contained in at least one of the two reference sets [1000G (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Durbin et al., 2010</ref>) and Mills (<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mills et al., 2011b)]</ref>. Pindel called only 209 indels of which 142 (67.9%) are in one of the reference sets. The Pindel and SplazerS call sets overlap in 130 indels (62.2% of Pindel call set). Of the 79 indels unique to Pindel, 44 (55.7%) correspond to an indel in the reference set. Of the 262 indels unique to<ref type="bibr">SplazerS, 195 (74.4%</ref>) are in the reference set. These results do not only prove a significantly higher sensitivity for SplazerS, but also indicate higher specificity. Adding SplazerS' unanchored split mapping results, the SplazerS set of called indels increases from 392 to 534 (last column in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). Of the additional 142 indels, 90 (63.4%) are contained in one of the reference sets. This indicates a slight decrease in indel callingspecificity, but at the gain of much improved sensitivity: &gt;30% additional indels are attributed to single-end split mapping. In summary, SplazerS was able to recover 391 known indels, while Pindel could only recover 142. In particular, SplazerS is more sensitive and robust in variant-rich regions, as revealed by additional analyses on a high coverage 100 bp Illumina read dataset (Supplementary Material S3 and<ref type="figure">Fig. S1</ref>). Our analyses suggest that Pindel's sensitivity is between 50% and 70% of SplazerS' sensitivity on anchored reads only (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>and Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table S2</ref>). Applying the edit distance feature exhibited a further increase in sensitivity of ∼ 2.6% (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table S2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Single-end reads: simulations demonstrate high accuracy of split read approach</head><p>On the simulated single-end read dataset, we tested the indel prediction accuracy of different tools for varying read lengths (100–150 bp) and coverages (5–30×).<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>shows the results in terms of sensitivity. Corresponding p measurements are given in Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S2</ref>.<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>shows the results in terms of sensitivity and PPV for 125 bp reads at ∼ 30× coverage, dividing indels into different size ranges: three small indel classes for insertions/deletions of 1–3 bp, 4–9 bp and 10–50 bp in size; and three large structural variant classes for sizes 51–500 bp, 501 bp–1 kb and &gt;1 kb.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>shows how sensitivity increases with coverage and with read length. In all settings, SplazerS is the most sensitive and most precise tool. At 30×, it already recovers &gt;90% of implanted indels on the 100 bp reads; for the 150 bp reads sensitivity reaches &gt;95%. GSNAP is always a few percentage points behind SplazerS, with Page: 624 619–627SplazerS' lead being more pronounced on longer reads and higher coverage (1.8% lead on 100 bp at 5× compared with 4.3% on 150 bp at 30×). Due to its exact 12mer matching approach, GSNAP systematically fails to detect certain indels, even in high coverage data. BWA is less sensitive and less precise than the other tools.<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>shows that BWA's sensitivity mainly suffers from missed deletions &gt; 50 bp. With increased read length, it can also detect larger indels and thus its overall sensitivity increases. For indels &lt;10 bp, BWA is the most sensitive tool, but with the lowest PPV. For indels ≥10 bp, SplazerS has the highest sensitivity. Furthermore, it maintains the highest PPV in all indel categories. Most notably, SplazerS achieves the highest sensitivities in the SV deletion categories. Both GSNAP and SplazerS exhibit a 'temporary' drop in sensitivity for the smallest SV deletion class. The low sensitivity is due to low complexity and repeat sequences where reads are often ambiguously mappable or even wrongly mapped without a middle gap. Nevertheless, SplazerS maintains a high PPV and higher sensitivity than GSNAP for these difficult-to-map indels. In order to investigate whether our results are robust with respect to different indel calling programs, we conducted an additional analysis replacing our in-house tool snpStore with Dindel (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Albers et al., 2010</ref>). This analysis exhibited the same relative sensitivity results for SplazerS, GSNAP and BWA, and furthermore demonstrated that SplazerS was again the most accurate tool in terms of sensitivity as well as PPV (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#tab_4">Table S4</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Application to real single-end data demonstrates versatility</head><p>Using SplazerS in the targeted exon resequencing study, on average 67 indels were predicted per patient. The overlap of predicted indels with dbSNP and DGV was between 38.89% and 71.79% per patient, with mean overlap of 54.99%. Of the total set of indels predicted in at least one patient, 39.02% were present in dbSNP or DGV.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>shows the size distribution of all indels &gt;5 bp (the majority of smaller indels were predicted with a different method using edit distance alignments). As expected, the majority of indels is located in non-coding sequences (417 out of 456). Non-coding indels occur mostly in tandem repeat regions in units of 2, 3 or 4. Of the 39 coding indels, 29 (74.35%) are multiples of 3, usually having lesser impact on the protein level. Large deletions ≥100 bp are rather rare (61 in total). On average, three large deletions were predicted per patient. Interestingly, we observed a strong variance between patients. Closer inspection revealed that locations of large deletions often cluster on the chromosome.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6A</ref>visualizes these clusters in 1 Mb bins over the X chromosome. Surprisingly, deletions do not only co-localize, but often their boundaries also coincide exactly with annotated exon–intron boundaries.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6B</ref>shows one such case where five predicted deletions span all introns of the PQBP1 gene. These 'intron deletions' strongly suggest the presence of a retrocopy of this gene.PCR experiments with several primer pairs confirmed a complete, possibly functional retrocopy of PQBP1. This finding is particularly interesting, as it has been shown previously that mutations in PQBP1 cause X-linked intellectual disability (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kalscheuer et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lenski et al., 2004</ref>). Additional (partial) retrocopies were predicted for FAM104B, MSN, MPP1, EIF1AX, RBMX and OPHN1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DISCUSSION</head><p>The availability of various kinds of sequencing data, i.e. derived from different sequencing technologies and protocols, has fueled the development of various computational tools for indel identification [for reviews, see<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alkan et al. (2011) and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Medvedev et al. (2009)]</ref>. Often the overlap of predicted indels between different computational methods is low (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Mills et al., 2011a</ref>), indicating that none of the methods is fully comprehensive and a satisfactory solution is yet to be found. Therefore, a comprehensive method is likely to use an integrative approach, combining the strengths of different methods. The split read mapping approach has its strength in the potential to exactly predict indel size and location. Early next-generation technologies yielded very short read lengths (36 bp) where only anchored split mapping was feasible, with the mapping search space greatly reduced by a confidently mapped paired end (<ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Ye et al., 2009</ref>). However, advances in sequencing technology have led to singleend reads long enough to reliably predict long deletions and also medium-sized insertions without anchoring. SplazerS supports both anchored paired-end split mapping as well as unanchored singleend split mapping, which is a unique feature among split read mapping tools. By adding unmapped paired-end reads and treating them as single-end data, a significant increase in sensitivity could be demonstrated. In our comparisons with Pindel (<ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Ye et al., 2009</ref>), which to our knowledge is the most widely used paired-end split read indel detection method, and with state-of-the-art single-end split read aligners, SplazerS showed highest PPV and highest sensitivity, especially in variant-rich regions. This strength may prove especially Page: 626 619–627</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.-K.Emde et al.</head><p>valuable when mapping reads from highly mutated or diverged genomes to a related reference, as is the case in cancer genome sequencing (<ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Stratton, 2011</ref>), or in evolutionary genetics studies such as<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Green et al. (2010)</ref>where Neanderthal DNA was mapped onto a human and a chimpanzee reference sequence. On real data, a large overlap with annotated variation was obtained when using SplazerS. In addition, predicted indels followed the expected pattern of indel size distributions for coding as well as noncoding sequences (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Durbin et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Ng et al., 2009</ref>). Furthermore, the percentage of coding, in-frame indels is in agreement with the previous studies (<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Ng et al., 2009</ref>). Altogether we show that our method is versatile as it is applicable to anchored paired-end as well as unanchored and single-end data, and is not constrained to short read lengths. Even more, its sensitivity proved to further increase with read length, making its application to upcoming longer reads promising. While not explicitly tested, SplazerS' edit-distance feature will also allow application to 454 sequencing reads (<ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Wheeler et al., 2008</ref>). In this work, we used the mapping results of SplazerS in conjunction with a simple indel detection method. Previously, it has been shown that realignment of reads at indel candidate positions can significantly improve indel prediction accuracy (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Albers et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Homer and Nelson, 2010</ref>). We expect that SplazerS' support for SAM output format will make it easy to integrate with other indel detection tools, which may further improve accuracy of split read indel detection. In contrast to Pindel, inversions are not yet handled by SplazerS. We are currently investigating strategies to generalize the splitread approach to detect complex structural variants including interchromosomal translocations which neither Pindel nor SplazerS can handle. However, the successful detection of retrocopy events suggests that SplazerS may also be applicable for spliced mapping of RNA-seq data.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig.2.</head><figDesc>Fig. 2.

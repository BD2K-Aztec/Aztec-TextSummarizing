				<p>The program sampletrees is a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler of gene genealogies conditional on either phased or unphased SNP genotype data. The companion program Rsampletrees is for pre-and post-processing of sampletrees files, including setting up the files for sampletrees and storing and plotting the output of a sampletrees run. Availability and implementation: sampletrees is implemented in C þþ. The source code, documentation and test files are available at http://stat.sfu.ca/statgen/research/sampletrees.html. The R package Rsampletrees is available on CRAN http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ Rsampletrees/index.html.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The gene genealogy is a tree that describes the ancestral relationships among chromosomal segments sampled from individuals in a population. Knowledge of this ancestral tree has application in population genetic inference and for gene-mapping (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Burkett et al., 2013a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Zö llner and Pritchard, 2005</ref>). As the true tree cannot be known, the uncertainty can be handled with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) by sampling trees that are consistent with the observed data. The C þþ program sampletrees is used to sample gene genealogies conditional on genetic data observed at present. The algorithm is based on the approach outlined in (Zö llner and<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Pritchard, 2005</ref>). Letting s represent the genealogical tree, including branch times at a genomic location called the focal point, and G represent the SNP data, we wish to sample from the posterior distribution PR(sjG). This is achieved using an MCMC approach, where we sample from a distribution proportional to PR(G, s). This joint distribution is modelled by including additional latent variables representing the haplotype sequences of internal nodes of the tree, and the rates of mutation and recombination on the branches of the tree. To sample trees from the posterior distribution, at a step of the sampler, a proposal distribution that updates some components of the latent data (i.e. the mutation rate, recombination rate, internal node sequences, tree topology, or tip haplotypes) is selected and an update to the latent data is proposed. This update is either accepted or rejected according to the Metropolis-Hastings ratio. For further statistical details on the algorithm, please see Burkett et al. (2013b) and references therein. In addition to the C þþ program, the R package Rsampletrees is available to assist users with creating the input files needed by sampletrees and manipulate and display the results after sampletrees has been run. We expect the two programs to be used as follows:</p><p>1. With Rsampletrees, generate the necessary input files for sampletrees. 2. Run the sampletrees executable at the command line, passing the name of the settings file generated in Step 1 to the program. 3. Read in and summarize the results of Step 2 in R, using</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rsampletrees.</head><p>In the next section, we briefly describe the input and output files for sampletrees and how Rsampletrees can be used to generate and analyze these files.@BULLET settings file: The settings file is used to specify the input and output data file names, the type of data, information about the MCMC run (chain length, burn-in, thinning), the location of the focal point, initial values for the latent variables and parameters for the prior distributions. @BULLET weights file: The weights file indicates which proposal distributions to sample from and their sampling probabilities. @BULLET SNP data file: Both unphased genotype and phased haplotype data are allowed. If phased SNP data are available, the haplotype option is used and the haplotype file should consist of one haplotype per row, with allele codes as 0 or 1. If the genetic data is not phased, the genotype option can be used and the genotype file should consist of one multi locus genotype per row with genotypes coded as 0, 1 or 2 (number of copies of one of the alleles). @BULLET SNP location file: The relative genomic locations of the SNPs. @BULLET haplotype frequency file: With the genotype option, the user must provide an additional data file giving 2-locus haplotype frequency estimates between adjacent SNPs. @BULLET (optional) initial haplotype phase configurations file and haplotype list file: To improve convergence with the genotype option, we recommend that the user also provide a file with an initial haplotype configuration for each individual in the dataset to start the sampling and a file with a list of haplotypes with high probability to exist in the population.</p><p>Rsampletrees can be used to generate and manipulate the settings file, the weights file and the haplotype frequency file (unphased genotype data). The optional initial haplotype phase configurations and optional haplotype list can be estimated using programs like PHASE (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Stephens et al., 2001</ref>) or with Rsampletrees functions. Sampletrees is run by typing &gt;./sampletrees settingsfile in a shell (linux and Mac) or sampletrees.exe settingsfile at the command prompt (Windows), where 'settingsfile' gives the name of the settings file. The program will print the run settings to the screen so that the user can verify that these were read in correctly. In addition, the iteration number of the sampling is also periodically printed out in order to monitor progress. sampletrees generates multiple output files that give: (i) sampled mutation and recombination rates, (ii) sampled tree topology and branch lengths in Newick format, (iii) initial latent data, (iv) final latent data, which is useful for increasing the chain length and (v) a table of acceptance proportions for each of the updates. MCMC sampling of genealogic trees is known to be computationally intensive and to therefore require long run times (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Kuhner, 2009</ref>). For example, it takes approximately 8 h for one million iterations on a dataset of 100 individuals and 25 SNPs; increasing the dataset to 150 individuals or doubling to 50 SNPs increases the run time to almost 14 h (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Burkett et al., 2013b</ref>). We have found that run time of the algorithm increases linearly with both number of SNPs and number of individuals in the sample. As with all MCMC algorithms, convergence of the chain should be assessed by the user. Larger datasets and genotype data will require greater numbers of iterations and so the run time is increased by both the larger dataset size and the longer Markov chain. To estimate run time, we recommend timing a preliminary run with a short chain first, and then extrapolating.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Rsampletrees</head><p>The R package Rsampletrees was developed to help users create the input files for sampletrees and process the output of a sampletrees run. The functions are designed around two main tasks: @BULLET Pre-sampletrees: create the settings file with the arguments for a sampletrees run, including setting up initial haplotype files if the data is of type genotype. @BULLET Post-sampletrees: read in the output files, compute summary statistics on the trees, plot the results.</p><p>We have also developed functions to help re-start a sampletrees run to allow for increasing the number of MCMC iterations. The pre-sampletrees functions take and/or return a list object that consists of the settings for a sampletrees run. The post-sampletrees functions take and/or return a list object consisting of three components: 1. runinfo: The settings used in the sampletrees run. 2. rawdata: Raw data from the run. This is a list consisting of the iteration number for the MCMC samples, the sampled mutation and recombination rates, and either the sampled trees or the name of the file containing the sampled trees (because the tree files are very large). 3. procdata: Processed data and tree statistics from the run. This is initially a list with one element: a matrix of acceptance proportions of each of the MCMC updates for the run. If the user computes summary statistics on the sampled trees, Rsampletrees functions can be used to apply these tree statistics to the trees and store these results in procdata. The summary statistics can also be written to file for later analysis. Additional details about Rsampletrees functions can be found in the R help files and in the documentation provided at http://stat. sfu.ca/statgen/research/sampletrees.html. Users are expected to create R functions that take a tree as input and return a summary. Rsampletrees uses the R package ape (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Paradis et al., 2004</ref>) and its classes 'phylo' or 'multiPhylo' (a list of trees of class 'phylo') to represent the trees. For more information about these classes, please see http://ape-package.ird.fr/misc/ FormatTreeR_24Oct2012.pdf.</p></div>

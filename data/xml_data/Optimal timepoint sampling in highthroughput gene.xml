				<p>Motivation: Determining the best sampling rates (which maximize information yield and minimize cost) for time-series high-throughput gene expression experiments is a challenging optimization problem. Although existing approaches provide insight into the design of optimal sampling rates, our ability to utilize existing differential gene expression data to discover optimal timepoints is compelling. Results: We present a new data-integrative model, Optimal Timepoint Selection (OTS), to address the sampling rate problem. Three experiments were run on two different datasets in order to test the performance of OTS, including iterative-online and a top-up sampling approaches. In all of the experiments, OTS outperformed the best existing timepoint selection approaches, suggesting that it can optimize the distribution of a limited number of timepoints, potentially leading to better biological insights about the resulting gene expression patterns.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Time-series high-throughput gene expression experiments can measure the expression levels of tens of thousands of genes in a biological sample over time and provide dynamic information which can be used to construct regulatory networks and infer regulatory relationships among genes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Wang et al., 2008</ref>). Although there are several thousand time-series microarray and RNA-seq datasets on the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Edgar et al., 2002</ref>), as of June 2012, most of these contain very few timepoints.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>shows that 475% of these datasets (in which 'time' has been set as a subset variable type) in GEO contain five or fewer timepoints. Given that researchers are often limited to being able to sample very few timepoints, it is extremely important to choose the most appropriate timepoints for observing strong target gene expression pattern changes. With a fixed number of samples, researchers can choose between (i) a very densely sampled short time-series experiment, in which important gene regulation events that do not occur quickly may be missed or (ii) a sparsely sampled long time-series experiment, where improperly positioned timepoints can lead to missing rapid but important regulation events and can also lead to temporal aggregation bias (which reduces the ability to infer actual regulatory relationships;<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Singh et al., 2005</ref>). Determining the best sampling timepoints for sparsely sampled time-series high-throughput experiments is a challenging optimization problem that is frequently discussed in the biological literature (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chikina et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gustafsson and Hornquist, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Marioni et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Massonnet et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Wang et al., 2008</ref>). An active learning algorithm has been developed for iteratively choosing timepoints to sample, using the uncertainty in the interpolation of the currently estimated time-dependent curve as the objective function (<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Singh et al., 2005</ref>). The performance evaluation in this study showed that this algorithm can find optimal timepoints such that majority cycling yeast genes can be identified. However, to capture the differential gene expression patterns, the interpolation step requires a minimum of five timepoints (according to their online documentation), so it would not have been applicable for 75% of the existing datasets in GEO and would have only been able to predict very few timepoints in almost all of the existing datasets. Furthermore, active learning is based only on the differential gene expression data in the dataset to which a new timepoint will be added, and existing time-series datasets using similar treatments (which may be high resolution and contain useful differential gene expression information) cannot be applied in the algorithm. Although other advanced gene expression prediction or interpolation methods can utilize sequence information (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Beer and Tavazoie, 2004</ref>) and 'biologically plausible' constraints (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Falin and Tyler, 2011</ref>) on gene expression estimates, these approaches do not address the complicated issue of timepoint selection among large groups of genes and also cannot utilize existing data. In this article, we present a new model called Optimal Timepoint Selection (OTS) to identify optimal sampling timepoints for new microarray and RNA-seq experiments, based *To whom correspondence should be addressed. on gene expression data in existing datasets. We build OTS based on three observations: (1) Gene expression experiments can be sampled in an online fashion; i.e. samples can be treated and collected at a high rate and then stored at a relatively low cost, and particular samples can be measured at a later time, after deciding which timepoint will be optimal (<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Singh et al., 2005</ref>). (2) A researcher is usually interested in capturing the expression patterns of a subset of genes (which may be grouped into several clusters with similar expression patterns) associated with a given treatment/condition. and (3) Differential gene expression patterns from previous experiments performed under similar treatments/conditions can provide information valuable for defining an optimal timepoint for sampling, even if the sampling rates are different from the new experiment. Based on these observations, a straightforward approach to choosing the best timepoint is to find unsampled timepoints at which there are significant upregulation or downregulation events for the genes of interest in the existing datasets. This approach is based on the assumption that the differential expression patterns for the genes of interest in existing datasets are similar to each other and are similar to the dataset to which a timepoint will be added. However, in practice, this assumption may be violated in many cases due to (1) large differences in the dynamic ranges between platforms (e.g. RNA-seq technology has a dynamic range several orders of magnitude higher than microarray technology;<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Marioni et al., 2008)</ref>; (2) inconsistency among different datasets, either due to different growing conditions, different treatments or 'lab signatures', which result in differences in differential gene expression patterns among different laboratories, even after attempts to reproduce conditions exactly (<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Massonnet et al., 2010</ref>); (3) high noise rates in expression values, particularly for microarray datasets (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Marioni et al., 2008</ref>) and (4) sparse sampling rates in existing data. To address these data integration problems, we have developed OTS, which includes a novel method of combining differential gene expressions from existing datasets ('training' datasets) based on their similarity to the experiment to which timepoints will be added ('current' dataset). OTS is novel in the following ways:</p><p>(1) Projection of differential gene expression to threshold space: In contrast to existing differential gene expression prediction algorithms (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chikina et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Falin and Tyler, 2011</ref>;<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gustafsson and Hornquist, 2010</ref>), the goal of our method is to predict the best timepoints to add to a high-throughput experiment. Therefore, rather than focusing on specific expression patterns, we are instead interested in how many genes are significantly differentially expressed at each timepoint, and how significant the overall expression values are (in a categorized fashion). Consequently, we project the differential gene expression values to threshold space to better capture important regulatory timepoints (explained in Section 2.3).</p><p>(2) Data normalization and scaling: Instead of averaging or pooling all of the training data together, we first weight each training data's contribution to the overall result based on their similarity to the current dataset. Then, we adjust the weighted-average values with a shifting function for local fitting (explained in Section 2.4).</p><p>(3) Timepoint selection with multi-objective optimization (MOO): We adopt a MOO model to select the overall optimal timepoint for all of the clusters (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Coello, 1999</ref>). MOO is superior to the sampling voting method because timepoints chosen by MOO benefit all (or the majority) of clusters, while the sampling voting method may be biased to one or a few clusters (explained in Section 2.5).</p><p>The overall experimental approach for OTS is shown in Supplementary Figure S1 and Section S1. First, a biological experiment is performed, and samples are preserved at dense timepoints. A subset of timepoints (including at least the last timepoint in the range of interest and one other timepoint) is sampled. Then, time-series training datasets are collected. It is not necessary for the training datasets to be collected using the same technology (i.e. PCR, microarray or RNA-seq experiments), but they should use treatments or conditions that are expected to affect target treatment–response genes in the same way as in the current dataset. OTS produces a ranked list of the optimal timepoints to be selected next. The optimal timepoint(s) can then be sampled and added to the current dataset for the identification of the next optimal timepoint. This process can then be continued iteratively until all of the samples or all of the resources available for sampling are used up. This online-sampling approach is advantageous when studying organisms for which the sample collection step is significantly less expensive than the gene expression measurement step. For difficult or costly experiments (including clinical experiments), it is more logical to measure the gene expression in every available sample (<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Singh et al., 2005</ref>). In the performance experiments in this study, OTS was applied using high-throughput time-series datasets for two different organisms (yeast and Arabidopsis) utilizing different platforms (microarray and RNA-seq). Noisy, sparsely sampled and poorly matched datasets were used as training. In all the experiments, OTS clearly outperforms the existing approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">METHODS</head><p>The goal of this article is to develop a computational algorithm to design the sampling rate of time-series gene expression experiments such that the real differential gene expression patterns for genes of interest are captured as accurately as possible. Specifically, our approach is to generate an estimate dataset by integrating training data, and to identify the timepoint at which the estimate dataset is the most different from the current dataset, which may result in the identification of the most significant differential regulation events missing in the current dataset.Mathematically, given training datasets R ¼ fR 1 , R 2 ,. .. , R m g, a current dataset U (with differential gene expression values available at timepoint set T S and unmeasured biological samples available at timepoint set T A ), rank the optimal timepoints in the timepoint set T opt , such that the best-ranked timepoints minimize the difference between the interpolated and real differential gene expression curves for all genes of interest G. The outline of OTS is shown in Algorithm 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Case study</head><p>For demonstration purposes, we used an Arabidopsis coronatinetreatment dataset as a case study (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2A</ref>). This dataset was produced to determine the effect of the phytotoxin coronatine (a molecular mimic of the plant hormone jasmonate) on global gene expression (manuscript in preparation). We used this densely sampled (21 timepoint) RNA-seq dataset as a mock 'current' biological experiment (first row in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2A</ref>), and a number of existing microarray datasets involving coronatine/jasmonate treatment as training datasets (see Section 3.1;<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chung et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Wierstra and Kloppstech, 2000</ref>). This case study starts with six timepoints, at 0.25 h (the first), 24 h (the last), and 1, 2, 3 and 5 h (selected iteratively by the first four rounds of OTS selection), and the fifth round of timepoint selection will be outlined in detail here (see Section 3.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Differential gene expression clustering and interpolation</head><p>As the first step of OTS (line 1 in Algorithm 1), all of the genes of interest (G) are clustered using K-means clustering [<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dembl and Kastner, 2003</ref>; implemented in Cluster 3.0 (http://rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm);<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Eisen et al., 1998]</ref>based on their differential gene expression values in the training datasets R, which produces C, the set of clusters. In the case study, the coronatine-responsive genes were separated into 10 clusters; the log2 fold change curves for the 13 genes in one of these clusters are shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3A</ref>. To estimate the differential gene expression patterns at all timepoints, OTS linearly interpolates the values from the current (U) and the training (R) datasets to every available timepoint in T A (Algorithm 1, lines 4 and 5;<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Meijering, 2002</ref>). Linear interpolation was used in order to minimize the inference of false peaks and valleys in the expression data (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Benesty et al., 2004</ref>) and to avoid over-smoothing unevenly spaced timepoints, which occurs on sparsely sampled datasets when using other common interpolation methods (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Meijering, 2002</ref>).</p></div>

This thresholding process reduces noise in the comparison among datasets by ignoring small fluctuations in differential gene expression value patterns while capturing the overall pattern of the larger gene expression changes at various magnitudes. To avoid the bias introduced by setting only one regulation threshold value, multiple evenly spaced positive and negative differential regulation threshold values are defined to determine the degree to which a cluster of genes is differentially regulated at a given timepoint i, according to Equation (1). Given a user-defined threshold number H, we divide the threshold space (3 SDs above and below the average differential gene expression value) into two H sections. For example in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3B</ref>, an H-value of 6 has been used, and threshold values are shown. Mathematically, to perform thresholding for a gene g with an expression value at timepoint i in dataset R j , we compute its differential regulation count (DRC) by counting how many thresholds it is higher (or lower) than if it is up-(or down-) regulated. This represents the DRC for timepoint i in dataset R j (D ij ; Equation (1)). Higher DRC numbers indicate stronger differential regulation, regardless of whether the genes are upregulated or downregulated. The use of multiple thresholds ensures that changing patterns in experiments with different dynamic ranges are captured. For example, in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3C</ref>, one gene crosses the top upregulation threshold (at 4.11), and three genes cross the next upregulation threshold (at 3.29). These counts are made for each regulation threshold and summed (<ref type="bibr">Equation (1)</ref>). DRC curves for all the training and current datasets for cluster 2 in this case study are shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3D</ref>.</p><formula>D ij ¼ X g2Gc X H h¼1 e ij g À ðþ3ÞðhÀ1Þ H 40 þ e ij g À ðÀ3ÞðhÀ1Þ H 50 ð1Þ</formula><p>where D ij is the DRC for timepoint i in one cluster in dataset R j , H is the user-defined threshold (H41), e ij g is the differential expression measurement for gene g (out of the set of genes in a cluster) and and are the average and the standard deviation values, respectively, for the differential gene expression values across all timepoints and all genes of interest G in all the training datasets. Operator<ref type="bibr">[x]</ref>returns 1 if x is true, otherwise it returns 0. Similarly, DRC values for the current dataset ( ^ D i ) are calculated for each timepoint i in each cluster.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Data normalization and scaling</head><p>To ensure that OTS allows for efficient computation and is capable of integrating heterogeneous training data, DRC values are saved in a cluster-time-experiment (CTE) table for each cluster.<ref type="figure">Table 1</ref>shows the layout of the CTE table, which includes DRC values (D ij ) for every timepoint i (1 i n) in every training dataset j (1 j m) in one cluster. An 'estimate' DRC dataset is generated for each cluster by combining the training datasets from the CTE table, and the difference between the current and estimate DRC datasets is measured at each timepoint, where the largest difference is the optimal timepoint for each cluster. However, combining the training DRC datasets into an estimate DRC dataset is a difficult problem because the training DRC datasets may not be similar to each other or to the current DRC dataset (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3D</ref>). Although there are numerous ways to normalize and scale the datasets (such as least-squares estimation), the challenge is that the difference between the estimate and current DRC datasets will not converge to 0 even if numerous timepoints are added (because of differences among experimental conditions and among sampling rates), leading to biased estimations of the differential gene expression patterns. To tackle this problem, we have developed a novel two-step (global matching and local fitting) normalization and scaling approach (Algorithm 1, line 11). In the first step (global matching), we weight each training DRC dataset's contribution to the overall result based on their similarity to the current DRC dataset in each cluster using NNLS regression (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chen et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lawson and Hanson, 1995</ref>). Mathematically, given a n Â m matrix of DRC values derived from the training DRC datasets (D ij ), and an n Â 1 vector of DRC values derived from the current DRC dataset ( ^ D), a non-negative m Â 1 weight vector w is calculated, which minimizes the difference between weighted training and current DRC datasets (i.e. w ¼ arg min jjDw À ^ Djj 2 ). This weight vector w is then used to calculate a weighted-sum NNLS estimate DRC dataset (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3E</ref>). By forcing all of the weight values to be non-negative, it avoids a problem introduced by standard LSE regression, wherein negative weights can 'flip' the patterns, changing peaks to valleys and providing false information in the estimation. This step also results in normalization of experiments with different dynamic ranges. In the second step (local fitting), in order to correct the NNLS estimate fit, NNLS-weighted sum DRC values are shifted for each timepoint, such that the final estimate DRC dataset values are equal to the current dataset DRC values at every sampled timepoint T S (indicated by vertical dashed grey lines in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3F</ref>). The rest of the timepoints in the NNLS-weighted estimate DRC dataset are shifted by an amount suggested by the sampled timepoints and modulated by their distance from the sampled timepoints according to a sigmoid weight distributed (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chen and Mangasarian, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Marler et al., 2006</ref>). In summary, the estimate value at timepoint t i ( D i ) is defined as</p><formula>D i ¼ ^ D i if t i 2 T S P m j¼1 w j D ij þ 2 ^ D t À P m j¼1 wjD tj 1þe 5jtÀt i j jT A [T S j otherwise 8 &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt; &gt; &gt; &gt; : ; ð2Þ where t ¼ arg max t2TS ^ D t À X m j¼1 w j D tj</formula><p>and t i is a timepoint in the interpolated current dataset (T A [ T S ), ^ D t is the DRC value for timepoint t in the current DRC dataset ( ^ D), D ij is the DRC value for timepoint t i in training DRC dataset (R j ) and w j is the weight assigned by NNLS for training data R j : In the fraction component of this equation, the numerator calculates the largest observed shift (i.e. the largest amount of disagreement between the NNLS estimate and the sampled timepoints in the current dataset), which occurs at timepoint t. The denominator then reduces the amount of this shift for the given timepoint t i , such that the shift will be smaller if there is more distance between t i and t.</p><formula>R 1 R 2 .. .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Timepoint selection with MOO</head><p>By clustering all of the genes based on their expression patterns and comparing the estimate and current DRC datasets, we are able to rank all of the timepoints for one cluster using curve difference scores (Q i ). However, if the ranks for each timepoint are different in different clusters, a cross-cluster ranking method is needed to rank timepoints for the entire dataset. Instead of applying a sampling voting method (used in<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Singh et al., 2005</ref>) which may be biased towards optimal timepoints in one or few clusters, OTS applies a MOO model to rank optimal timepoints which will most benefit all of (or the majority of) the clusters (Algorithm 1, lines 13 and 14;<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Coello, 1999</ref>). Mathematically, MOO computes a-score (indicating optimality) for each timepoint. First,-dominance is determined for each timepoint pair as follows: we say timepoint t 1-dominates timepoint t 2 (denoted as t 1 1 t 2 ) if Q 1 is larger than Q 2 in clusters, where 1 jCj: For example, in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4A</ref>, the Q-values for every cluster in the 12-h column are larger than the Q-values for all 10 of the clusters in the 6-h column, so the 12-h timepoint-dominates the 6-h timepoint at ¼ 10. Second, the-score of a timepoint i is defined as the number of other timepoints that i-dominates, according to: À scoreði, Þ ¼ fi 0 ji 6 ¼ i 0 , i 2 T A , i 1 i 0 g , ð3Þ where i is a timepoint in T A and i 0 is any other timepoint in T A : Optimal timepoints are selected by ranking based on the-score values of the timepoints. Initially, is set to the number of clusters (jCj), but if two or more timepoints share the same-score (such as 1.5, 8, 10 and 14 h in the first row of<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4B</ref>) then they are compared at ¼ jCj À 1 (where, in the second row of<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4B</ref>, timepoint 1.5 outranks the others to get a second-place overall rank). If there remains a tie, then they are compared at ¼ jCj À 2, and the process is repeated until each timepoint is ranked. Using the final ranked timepoint list, researchers are free to sample one or more of the top-ranked timepoints in their biological experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</head><p>Three main experiments were used to evaluate the performance of OTS, and the performance was compared with uniform distribution and active learning timepoint selection (where applicable) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Singh et al., 2005</ref>). In the first experiment (which uses the Arabidopsis datasets described in Section 3.1), only the first and last timepoints from the current dataset were used as initial input, with five additional optimal timepoints added one-at-a-time, to simulate 'iterative-online sampling' on an initially very sparse dataset. This first experiment was re-ran three times with different parameters to demonstrate the effectiveness of OTS when using lower quality training datasets and different gene selection methods. A second 'iterative-online' sampling experiment was run with the yeast datasets (also described in Section 3.1). For the third experiment (which also used the yeast datasets), we start with five evenly distributed timepoints (at 5, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min), and then add two more timepoints as a batch to 'top-up' the timepoints sampled, simulating the situation of choosing extra timepoints after conducting initial sampling determined by researcher's knowledge/intuition. As a comparison, Singh et al.'s active learning algorithm was also used to choose optimal timepoints, using the same number of clusters as OTS. Active learning requires at least five timepoints as initial input, so it was used for the top-up experiment, but for the iterative-online experiments (which start with only two timepoints) the first three selected timepoints were chosen using a uniform distribution across the time series. Random timepoint selection was also performed, where timepoints were randomly selected within the time range of each experiment 250 times.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Datasets</head><p>OTS performance was tested on differential gene expression (fold change) datasets from two different organisms. The first was Arabidopsis, for which certain gene functions are well studied but dense time-series differential gene expression datasets are difficult to find. The current dataset used was from a high-resolution (20 timepoints) coronatine-treatment RNA-seq experiment. Coronatine is a toxin produced by Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 and is a molecular mimic of the jasmonate hormone which mediates wound response in Arabidopsis (<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Thilmony et al., 2006</ref>). So, several different training datasets utilizing coronatine (three timepoints), Pst. DC3000 (two timepoints;<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Thilmony et al., 2006</ref>and three timepoints;<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kilian et al., 2007</ref>) and wounding treatments (six timepoints;<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kilian et al., 2007</ref>) were used in this study (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2A</ref>). For this experiment, known jasmonate-responsive genes and circadian clock genes were selected as target genes (since the circadian clock influences jasmonic acid pathway activation;<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Goodspeed et al., 2012</ref>), based on the GO-SLIM categories 'response to jasmonic acid synthesis' (GO:0009753, 139 genes) and 'circadian rhythm' (GO: 0007623, 76 genes), for a total of 195 genes common to all the datasets. The second organism tested was yeast. Here, a 25-timepoint microarray dataset which used-factor treatment to synchronize cell cycles to the G 1 phase was used as the current dataset (<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Pramila et al., 2006</ref>). Three other-factor treatment datasets (25 and 12 timepoints;<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Pramila et al., 2006</ref>, and 17 timepoints;<ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Spellman et al., 1998</ref>), and one dataset in which temperature changes also synchronized the cells to the G 1 phase (12 timepoints;<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cho et al., 1998</ref>) were used as training datasetsfor every timepoint and every cluster and (B)-score tables used to determine the optimal timepoint for all the selected genes in the case study experiment. Lighter shading indicates higher curve scores, higher-scores and lower (better) ranks (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2B</ref>). All of the genes common to the datasets in the GO category 'mitosis' (i.e. cell division; GO:0007067, 90 genes total;<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ashburner et al., 2000</ref>) were used. In the Arabidopsis experiment, very large differential gene expression values were expected for jasmonic acid response, based on the literature (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chung et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Wierstra and Kloppstech, 2000</ref>), and very low levels of noise are expected in the RNA-seq dataset (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Marioni et al., 2008</ref>), so a threshold number (H) of 6 was used to preferentially capture these larger changes in expression. In contrast, for yeast experiments, a threshold number (H) of 3 was used in order to reduce the high expected noise in the datasets (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Cooper and Shedden, 2003</ref>), by ignoring the small fluctuations in differential gene expression measurements. The Arabidopsis and yeast datasets were grouped into 10 and 8 clusters, respectively. For these organisms, suitable training datasets were readily available; However, when there is not enough training data for an organism of interest, datasets from closely related organisms may be used, and homologous genes can be found in the target organisms using sequence similarities (<ref type="bibr" target="#b31">She et al., 2009</ref>). Another potential approach for preparing training datasets is to utilize time-alignment algorithms on the datasets obtained from similar experiments. For example, cell-cycle patterns can be synchronized by shifting and stretching the time axis to align the time-series expression patterns of key cycling genes between datasets (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aach and Church, 2001</ref>). On the other hand, if there are many training datasets, a pre-screening approach for selecting appropriate training datasets is required. All these approaches could be utilized as pre-processing steps, but the first two have not been tested in this study in order to minimize the complexity of our experimental approach, and the third approach is introduced in Supplementary Section S3 and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure S5</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Performance measurement</head><p>For performance evaluation, given the differential gene expression (fold change) data of a gene g in the current dataset, its predicted differential gene expression values at every unsampled timepoint were determined using linear interpolation. A measure of error between these interpolated and the actual differential gene expression values for all of the genes in G was derived, such that larger errors result from measurements with (1) poor agreement between the actual and predicted values and (2) large actual differential expression. These errors are summed for all genes and all timepoints and compared with the summed error at the start of the experiment to calculate the 'percentage sum error' (E r ) in the experiment:</p><formula>E r ¼ P g2G P jTAj i¼1 ^ e i g Á ð^ e i g À e ir g Þ P g2G P jTAj i¼1 ^ e i g Á ð^ e i g À e i0 g Þ , ð4Þ</formula><p>where r is the round of timepoint sampling, ^ e i g , e ir g and e i0 g are the actual differential gene expression value, the predicted differential gene expression value for a given round of sampling (r) and the predicted differential gene expression value at the start of the experiment, respectively, for gene g in the set of genes G at timepoint i (1 i jT A j). This equation is biased towards large errors for false negatives as opposed to false positives; That is, if we predict a small fold change for a gene which is actually strongly differentially regulated (false negative), then we miss an important biological event and the timepoint selection was poor. However, in the opposite case, if we predict a large fold change for gene which is not actually differentially regulated (false positive) and we choose to sample that timepoint, we may waste a sample, but have not missed an important regulation event for that gene. Error plots after the addition of the first timepoint in the iterative-online experiments and after the addition of both of the timepoints in the top-up experiment are shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5A</ref>–C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Performance analysis</head><p>In the Arabidopsis iterative-online experiment (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 6A</ref>), the addition of the first OTS timepoint (at 5 h) reduces the percentage sum error by 50%, which is much better than the timepoint selected by uniform distribution (12 h, 32%).<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5A</ref>shows that after the addition of this first timepoint, compared with OTS, uniform distribution selection predicts that many genes are unchanged or downregulated at timepoints where they are actually strongly upregulated (circles near the bottom right of the plot, indark-shaded areas). The second timepoint added by OTS (at 2 h) further reduced the error to 35% of the initial error, compared with uniform distribution, which still has 66% of the initial error and still misses many strong upregulation events (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. S2C</ref>). The early bias in the timepoint selection by OTS (which sampled at 1, 2, 3, 5 and 12 h) more effectively captures the early peaks expression levels of coronatine-induced genes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chung et al., 2008</ref>) than even timepoint distribution (6, 12 and 18 h) followed by active learning (0.5 and 20 h; Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. S3A</ref>). This experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of OTS across platforms, and when using sparsely sampled training datasets with slightly different biological treatments. In the iterative-online yeast experiment, OTS outperformed uniformly distributed timepoint selection (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 6B</ref>), reducing the error by 35% after the addition of just one timepoint at 20 min (compared with only 5% reduction at 60 min in uniform distribution). The error plot in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5B</ref>shows that the strongest differential regulation events are much more accurately defined by the timepoint selection in OTS (as shown by an abundance of even-timepoint spacing/active-learning circle marks in high-error areas in the bottom left and bottom right of the plot). After the addition of two timepoints selected by OTS (at 20 and 50 min), the initial percentage sum error is reduced by 47%, compared with just 14% reduction from uniform distributionselected timepoints (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 6B</ref>and Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. S2F</ref>). At the end of the experiment, the initial error is reduced by 56% using OTS timepoints (20, 35, 40, 50 and 95 min) compared with 51% using uniform distribution (30, 60, and 90 min) and active learning (25 and 95 min) timepoints (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. S3B</ref>). Like in the Arabidopsis experiment, OTS outperforms active learning at every number of timepoints tested, and there is also a bias towards early timepoints, probably due to stronger and more co-ordinated cyclic gene responses immediately after synchronization (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cho et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Spellman et al., 1998</ref>), and because many yeast cell cycle genes peak in late G 1 (at $20 min), the point at which the cell needs to 'decide' whether to divide or to continue to grow (<ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Rodriguez-Sanchez et al., 2011</ref>). Additional potential biological insights provided by using OTS in both the Arabidopsis and yeast experiments are outlined in Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure S4</ref>and Section S2 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chen et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fernandez-Calvo et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Martinez et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Xie et al., 1998</ref>). OTS also selects early timepoints in the top-up yeast experiment (10 and 20 min), reducing the error by 26%. In this experiment, active learning adds timepoints at 25 and 95 min, and only reduces the error by 14%. The error plot in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5C</ref>shows that the strongest upregulation events (on the right of the plot) are more accurately defined by the early timepoint selection in OTS, resulting in much stronger performance. Error plots for the start of each of the experiments and after the second round of the iterative-online experiments are shown in Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure  S2</ref>. These yeast experiments demonstrate strong performance for OTS despite a great deal of noise, because cell cycles are only weakly reproducible (even between replicates),-factor synchronization and temperature treatments may elicit stress-related gene responses (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Cooper and Shedden, 2003</ref>), and a very diverse set of genes is responsible for mitosis, which was the gene group selected here (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cho et al., 1998</ref>). The robustness of OTS was tested using the Arabidopsis experiment setup (1) against different training sets and (2) against different predefined genes of interest. First, the coronatine treatment microarray training dataset (in which the laboratory conditions were exactly the same as in the current experiment, making it the most closely matched dataset) was removed, to test whether OTS performance would be significantly affected. The results in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6C</ref>show that the removal of this best-matched dataset only slightly reduced performance (2.6% average decrease for all of the timepoints selected), showing that even with only the other three training datasets, which use similar but not identical biological treatments (i.e. wounding and DC3000 treatments), OTS is still effective. Next, a six-timepoint cold-treatment dataset (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kilian et al., 2007</ref>) was added to the four training datasets, to test whether adding poorly matched training data would negatively affect OTS performance. Cold treatment is appropriate for this test, as it functions through the DREB1/CBF transcriptional stress– response module, which is biologically and experimentally unrelated to the JAZ-MYC/MYB transcriptional modules activated by the coronatine/wounding response (<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Shinozaki et al., 2007</ref>). Again here, there was only a very slight reduction in performance with the inclusion of this poorly matched dataset (2.9% average decrease for all the timepoints selected), demonstrating the robustness of OTS against using poor training datasets, due to the assignment of relatively low weight values by the NNLS weighting step. A third training dataset test experiment was run, in which the well-matched coronatine treatment microarray experiment was removed and the poorly matched cold experiment was, the results of changing training datasets in the Arabidopsis experiment by removing the best-matched dataset, adding a poorly matched dataset and performing both of these changes together are shown. In (D), the results of choosing a gene set using an unsupervised approach in the Arabidopsis experiment are shown added to the training datasets. Here, there was only a 2.0% decrease in performance for the first timepoint, but the later timepoints had a slightly 45% decrease in performance (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 6C</ref>). The results of an unsupervised gene selection method are shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6D</ref>. Rather than using the knowledge-based gene ontology gene selection approach used in the other experiments, the top 100 genes with the highest fold change values across all four training datasets were selected. Here, three genes were removed from the analysis due to zero-control values in the current RNA-seq dataset (which result in undefined fold change values), and 8 clusters were used instead of 10 due to the smaller gene set size. This 97-gene set had little overlap (12 genes) with the knowledge-based gene selection set.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6D</ref>shows that the performance of the two different gene selection strategies is similar, suggesting that an unsupervised gene selection approach could be used to fully automate OTS when knowledge-based gene categorizations are not applicable. In summary, these tests indicate that OTS is able to learn sampling rates from suboptimal training data, its performance is robust against using irrelevant training data and it is compatible with automatic gene selection methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">CONCLUSION</head><p>We have demonstrated that OTS can out-perform existing algorithms at finding optimal timepoints for defining true differential gene expression patterns for large groups of target genes. We have shown that this algorithm is robust to the use of sparsely sampled, poorly matched and cross-platform data, as well as to noise in the datasets. Because it utilizes existing data effectively, OTS can be applied on datasets starting with as few as two timepoints, in contrast to the active learning algorithm which requires a minimum of five timepoints as input (<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Singh et al., 2005</ref>). As high-throughput gene expression measurement technologies continue to be developed, high-resolution sampling may eventually become cost-effective. For example, 'nanostrings' are a recently developed medium-throughput gene expression measurement technology capable of measuring up to 800 genes at once at a relatively low cost (<ref type="bibr">Brumbaugh et al., 2012</ref>). However, using this technology, not all of the genes in the organism can currently be sampled, and the gene list needs to be pre-defined. Since OTS simply uses gene differential expression values as input, it would be possible and very advantageous to use the results from nanostring or real-time PCR experiments as training data for OTS, to select optimal timepoints. For RNA-seq technology, highly multiplex sampling is becoming increasingly accurate, allowing for denser timepoint sampling with a moderate increase in cost (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Islam et al., 2011</ref>). As more time-series datasets are produced due to these advances in technology, more and better training datasets for OTS will be produced, and the demand for better knowledge-based timepoint selection methods will increase. In this article, OTS was tested only using differential gene expression values, but it could also be extended to use other types of data, including raw transcript number counts, relative protein quantities or any type of measurement that can be sampled in an online fashion. Overall, OTS can be used to significantly improve the results from biological experiments by allowing researchers to optimize the distribution of timepoints when there is a limit on the number of samples that can be measured across a time-series dataset. The estimation power of extrapolation of time-series gene expression data is much less than for interpolation, particularly for relatively simple linear extrapolation methods (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Haye et al., 2012</ref>). For this reason, OTS is currently limited to selecting timepoints within the time range available in training datasets. Eventually, more sophisticated extrapolation methods such as the non-linear differential equation models outlined in Haye et al. (2012) may be integrated to improve the predictive power of OTS.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig.1.</head><figDesc>Fig. 1.

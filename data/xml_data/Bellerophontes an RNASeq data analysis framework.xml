				<p>Motivation: Next-generation sequencing technology allows the detection of genomic structural variations, novel genes and transcript isoforms from the analysis of high-throughput data. In this work, we propose a new framework for the detection of fusion transcripts through short paired-end reads which integrates splicing-driven alignment and abundance estimation analysis, producing a more accurate set of reads supporting the junction discovery and taking into account also not annotated transcripts. Bellerophontes performs a selection of putative junctions on the basis of a match to an accurate gene fusion model. Results: We report the fusion genes discovered by the proposed framework on experimentally validated biological samples of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and on public NCBI datasets, for which Bellerophontes is able to detect the exact junction sequence. With respect to state-of-art approaches, Bellerophontes detects the same experimentally validated fusions, however, it is more selective on the total number of detected fusions and provides a more accurate set of spanning reads supporting the junctions. We finally report the fusions involving non-annotated transcripts found in CML samples.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The analysis of RNA-Seq data revealed to be particularly effective for the detection of fused genes, which have been shown to be involved in several diseases. By applying RNA-Seq short reads, novel fusion genes and in particular the VAPB-IKZF3 chimera have been found to play a key role in the survival in breast cancer cells (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Edgren et al., 2011</ref>). In, the analysis of single long reads has been performed to reveal novel fusion junctions. However, the application of short paired-end reads has been recently demonstrated to provide higher dynamic range and sensitivity in supporting fusion transcripts (). In paired-end * To whom correspondence should be addressed.reads, both the forward and reverse template strands of each DNA fragment are sequenced. The two sequenced ends, also known as the two 'mate' reads, are spaced by a gap of unknown nucleotides, whose size is approximately known. The nature of the paired-end reads and the way they map on a gene fusion boundary offer the opportunity to detect possible chimeric candidates.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>shows a schematic representation of how the paired-end reads map on two fused genes. According to the reads arrangement over the fusion junction, two scenarios might occur as follows (i) each mate of the read encompasses the junction and maps on a different gene of the fused gene couple. The read is considered as a read 'encompassing' the fusion boundary; (ii) alternatively, a single mate of the read overlaps the fusion junction while the corresponding paired-end mate matches one of the two genes involved in the fusion. In this case, the read is considered as 'spanning' the fusion junction. Encompassing reads can be used to find a first list of gene fusion candidates, while spanning reads are used to detect the exact boundary sequence. Since in the case of spanning reads the mate overlapping the junction breakpoint is discarded by conventional short reads aligners, these reads must be searched on the set of initially unmapped mates. These reads are then mapped on an artificially constructed putative fusion junction from candidate gene pairs previously detected through encompassing reads analysis. In this work, we propose a new framework for the detection of fusion transcripts through short paired-end reads. With respect to currently available solutions, Bellerophontes provides the following contributions: @BULLET To improve the quality and selectivity of fusion discovery, Bellerophontes selects those fusions matching an accurate<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Trapnell et al. (2009)</ref>, aimed at overcoming RNA-Seq challenges concerning multiple read alignment, novel transcript discovery and accounting for alternative splicing. In addition, it exploits recent researches about the pattern of reads mapping across fusion breakpoints (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Edgren et al., 2011</ref>), enabling a more accurate model of the fusion junction. On this concern, Bellerophontes presents distinguishing features with respect to fusion detection tools proposed in the last year (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Li et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">McPherson et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Sboner et al., 2010</ref>) http://tophat-fusion.sourceforge.net, in that it integrates these new instruments in a fusion detection software framework. In this article, we report the fusion genes discovered by the proposed framework on experimentally validated biological samples of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Soverini et al., 2011</ref>), and on public NCBI datasets of validated fusions. We also performed a comparative analysis with an alternative stateof-art approach (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">McPherson et al., 2011</ref>) on the same datasets. The results highlight that Bellerophontes, while recognizing the validated fusions, reduced the final set of predictions and includes fusions involving non-annotated genes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Procedure and algorithms</head><p>This section first focuses on the computational infrastructure of the proposed tool and, then reports details about the application of the tool to real data analysis. The flow is mainly composed of two building blocks: 'chimeric candidates detection' and 'exact junction breakpoint analysis' (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>). 'chimeric candidates detection' aims at providing the list of possible chimeric candidates by detecting and analyzing those reads encompassing putative fusion junctions. 'exact junction breakpoint analysis' relies on the detection of the exact junction breakpoint between two gene candidates through the collection of reads spanning the putative junction breakpoint.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2a</ref>depicts the schematic flow of the chimeric candidates detection. This phase is composed of three steps:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">Chimeric candidates detection</head><p>(i) Initial sample alignment to the genome reference; (ii) mapping of read mates to transcripts determined by abundance analysis and (iii) detection of the encompassing reads from the overall set.<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Langmead et al. (2009)</ref>for aligning pairedend reads to the reference genome. Conversely, we exploit the capability of TopHat alignment tool (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Trapnell et al., 2009</ref>) to align read fragments on a reference genome considering splicing events. TopHat reports variable length alignments due to the presence of splicing junction breakpoints. Consequently, the framework has to take into account spliced alignments to the reference genome instead of fixed length reads. At the end of the initial alignment of paired-end reads, both mapped (that include possible encompassing) and unmapped (that include possible spanning) reads are extracted. Mate-gene mapping. In order to find out candidate genes involved in a fusion event, we need to assign the read location to an annotation file. In the 'mate-gene mapping' (see<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>), we map each aligned mate on the transcripts detected by transcript abundance analysis by means of Cufflinks (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Trapnell et al., 2010</ref>), thus overcoming the limit of considering only known and annotated transcripts. In fact, analyzing RNA-Seq samples it is possible to reveal new alternative splicing events, novel genes and transcripts that might be neglected in an official annotation file. This is relevant in the context of chimeric transcripts, which are unpredictable events. In this context, a fusion possibly involves non-annotated genes or genes showing intron retentions. Considering only annotated gene isoforms, those reads encompassing the non-annotated region would be discarded and thus the fusion would not be detected.The collected set of mapped read mates is analyzed in order to retrieve the subset of reads having the two mates mapping on different genes. At the end of the chimeric candidates detection phase, the list of possible gene candidates and the set of initially unmapped reads are provided. On this set of candidates, a cascade of filters is applied to reduce the impact of errors due to the alignment phase as well as artifacts in the preparation of the biological sample (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Edgren et al., 2011</ref>). Moreover, ambiguous alignments due to paralogue or homologous regions are taken into account. Related filters will be discussed at the end of this section. As regards filters on artifacts, they are aimed at discarding: (i) reads that detect multiple couples of gene fusion candidates that, besides their discordant matching, they also have both mates on the same gene and (ii) reads showing an abnormal inner size (computed as described in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3</ref>) between the sequenced ends, or asymmetry in the alignment of the mates encompassing a fused gene (an example is shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 4</ref>). We focus now the discussion on the this second type of filter, namely, the 'abnormal inner size filter', which implements a strategy similar to<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Sboner et al. 2010</ref>, where the distribution of the inner distances in the sample is computed and outliers are removed based on a threshold. In this work, this has been set to 400 bp. In Bellerophontes, inner distance is computed through consensus regions as depicted in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>. This is a minimum inner distance,because the consensus regions are made by encompassing reads and for this reason they may not be complete, as reads spanning the junction in this phase of the pipeline are not considered. As such, the inner distance is in general larger than the sum of the consensi determined through encompassing reads. In this work, we also propose a new and extended implementation that takes into consideration a recent observation in<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Edgren et al. (2011)</ref>about the asymmetry in the alignment. This is recognized to be a feature of artifacted chimeric transcripts. This filter looks at consensus regions made by encompassing reads on the candidate genes. The length of these regions is computed (excluding possible gaps in between) as shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>. If one of the two regions, for instance the one related to Candidate A in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref>, is much larger than the corresponding consensus region of the Candidate B, the couple A–B is discarded. After filtering the reads involved in artifacts and alignment errors, another set of filters on chimeric candidates is performed. Candidates supported by a percentage of ambiguous reads with respect to the total number of reads are discarded (see<ref type="figure" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>in Section 3 for details). Ambiguous reads are caused by short or long homologous sequences in the reference genome. Fusion detection analysis is affected because the mate pairs that, without homologous sequences, would match on the same gene, match discordantly on two distinct but similar genes, thus creating fake encompassing reads. Homologous regions may be due both to the presence of paralogue genes that share long sequence regions and to the presence of short similar sequences. The 'homologous sequence artifacts filter' implements two different policies for both cases. Concerning the long homologous sequences due to paralogue genes, a filter that query TreeFam (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Li et al., 2006</ref>) database has been implemented. For short homologous sequences, we apply a strategy similar to what proposed in<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Sboner et al. (2010)</ref>, where read mates encompassing the fusion candidates are extracted and reversely mapped on the same genes. The remaining filters look at gene candidate distance and number of supporting encompassing reads. In particular, fusions occurring between genes closer than a user defined threshold are filtered out by the 'neighbor candidate filter', as they are considered instances of transcriptional readthroughs (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Edgren et al., 2011</ref>). Finally, since both alignment bias and biological sample preparation artifacts produce false fusion candidates that are typically supported by a small number of encompassing reads, chimeric candidates having the number of encompassing reads below a user-defined threshold are filtered out by the 'supported candidates thresholding filter. The threshold value depends on the coverage of the overall sequencing experiment and adopted protocol.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">Junction breakpoint analysis Starting</head><p>from the list of fused candidates previously detected, the scope of the exact junction breakpoint analysis phase, outlined in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2b</ref>, is to determine the exact junction breakpoint and validate the gene fusion by the alignment of unmapped reads to the putative junction. From a computational point of view, the problem of finding gene fusion junctions can be considered an extension of the detection of splicing events involving exons couples belonging to different genes and chromosomes. Splicing events introduce a considerable level of complexity in the analysis of RNA-Seq fragments. Intron regions cause many mismatches, making alignment programs to fail across the junction. Splicing discovery programs (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ameur et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bryant et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Trapnell et al., 2009</ref>) are aimed at efficiently detecting the exact intron–exon boundary. Due to the considerable computational complexity, they limit their research within a maximum intron size. To exploit the junction discovery capabilities of splicing detection tools without compromising computational efficiency, exact junction breakpoint analysis adopts a virtual reference: (i) for each couple of gene candidates, a virtual reference consisting in the concatenation of the two genes is created and (ii) a splicing discovery algorithm (i.e. TopHat) is launched on the virtual reference providing as input the initially unmapped reads resulting from the 'chimeric candidates detection phase. As shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2b</ref>, in order to create a 'virtual fusion junction' a 'create virtual reference' module automatically retrieves the sequences corresponding to the gene fusion candidates using the coordinates provided by Cufflinks. The corresponding sequence is retrieved from the reference in 'UCSC Genome Browser database' (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Fujita et al., 2010</ref>). Being based on Cufflinks coordinates, the sequences retrieved on the reference may correspond to annotated or non-annotated genes. The sequences are then concatenated and the resulting file represents the virtual genome reference of the virtual fusion junction. TopHat receives as input the set of unmapped reads and the virtual genome reference, resulting from the concatenation of the two gene fusion candidates. The result of TopHat is a file containing all the mapping reads including the spanning end mates. After TopHat alignment, a rearrangement from virtual to chromosomal coordinates is needed. Once the set of end mates spanning, the gene fusion junction is collected and the read coordinates are translated from virtual to genomic 'coordinates', it is possible to exactly determine the boundary junction among the two gene candidates. As shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 5</ref>, end mate reads spanning the fusion junction can be represented as a split read and each chunk maps on a different gene section. It is worth noting that all the spanning mate chunks are spaced by a gap in the genome reference. The exact points where the first mate chunk ends and the second mate chunk starts represent the exact junction boundary coordinates. In conclusion, at the end of the exact junction breakpoint analysis for each couple of gene fusion candidates, the set of putative junctions as well as the supporting spanning reads are reported. However, the detection of spanning reads can be affected by propagation errors due to both alignmentMate A maps differently on the two Candidate Gene A and B. Specifically a small fragment floats along the Candidate Gene B. The floating fragment removal filter removes the floating fragments considering as a valid mapping only the subsequences commonly mapped to the reference. Finally, only a single instance of read mapping is reported limitations and artifacts in the experimental preparation of the sample. For this reason, the resulting junctions are analyzed and filtered depending on how the spanning read maps on each junction. Next section describes the filtering policy applied to improve the accuracy of the junction detection.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3">Spanning read analysis and junction filtering</head><p>The exact junction breakpoint analysis provides a list of putative junctions boundaries between two fused genes. A selection is performed at this stage by looking at the distribution of the reads spanning the junction, to reveal possible artifacts. Therefore, we apply some filters in order to remove all the artifact junctions from the resulting set and to make junctions list more accurate. It might occur that the same read mate maps on the putative junction in multiple ways. In fact, some subsequences of the gene sequence might be homologous and consequently some small fragments of the read mate match the candidate gene in multiple places of the sequence. Thus, these fragments float on multiple places of the gene sequence and the accuracy of their mapping may be compromised. Furthermore, when this scenario occurs, TopHat reports a distinct read mate instance for each multiple match. However, this does not lead to a realistic count of the number of read mates supporting the junction. To address this issue, we propose 'Floating Fragment Removal Filter' that removes all the small floating fragments of the read mate sequence mapping on multiple places of the reference gene.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 6</ref>, on the upper part, shows an example where the second mate is characterized by fragments mapping on different locations. Specifically, this filter detects and preserves all those read mate subsequences mapping the reference in the same region (see the middle part of<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 6</ref>). In this way, only those read portions that are highly probable to be correctly mapped on the reference sequence are considered to support the putative junction. Moreover, as only the commonly mapped subsequences are preserved, it is pointless to report multiple instances of the same read mate, therefore the mate is considered as a unique (see bottom part of 6). A second filter, named PCR artifacts removal filter, is based on the observation that PCR amplification might cause false-putative junctions(<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Edgren et al., 2011</ref>). Reads mapping exactly to the same position are likely due to an artifact originated by amplification and sequencing of the same initial fragment repeated more times. As a result, multiple identical reads are considered as a single one and the fusion supported by those reads will be discarded unless other supporting spanning reads will be found. Since Cufflinks performs a transcript abundance analysis to detect the transcripts on which we map each aligned mate, reads duplication could affect the correct detection of the genes involved in the fusion as well as its junction breakpoint. We avoid the problem through the PCR artifact removal filter. Real fusions are characterized by a ladder-like pattern of the spanning reads supporting the junction (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 7a</ref>). Conversely, false-positive junctions due to PCR amplification artifacts lack this pattern and all the short read mates spanning the junction either map on the same position or are one or two bases shifted (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 7b</ref>). The PCR artifacts removal filter removes all those putative junctions lacking the ladder-like pattern. A final filtering is performed on as follows (i) candidate fusions supported by a number of spanning reads lower than a user defined threshold (supported junctions thresholding filter) and (ii) coherency with encompassing reads. In particular, the latter is based on the observation that, in presence of a genuine gene fusion, the genomic coordinates of the set of encompassing reads must be adjacent or in some cases overlapped to the location of the spanning reads. Bellerophontes creates a consensus of the final set of both encompassing and spanning reads and checks if the coordinates of the corresponding locations are either adjacent of overlapped. If this check is negative, the fusion candidate is discarded.</p></div>

Filter parameters used for these runs have been set as follows. Minimum supporting reads: 8; neighbor candidates filters: 500 000 bp; inner distance threshold: 400 bp. Under the hypothesis that the scientist is not interested in adjacent fused genes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Edgren et al., 2011</ref>), that can be detected by classical splicing detection tools, we set the neighbor candidates filters with 500 000 bp thresholds and this caused most of the revealed fusions to be interchromosome.<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>highlights the capability of Bellerophontes concerning the detection of validated fusions on a published dataset. These samples have lower coverage (at most 16 million reads) and smaller read length (50 bp) compared with CML data (see<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>for comparison). All the 14 fusions validated in the seven samples of melanoma cells (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Berger et al., 2010</ref>) and the TMPRSS2/ERG fusion (causally linked to prostate cancer) in NCIH660 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Sboner et al., 2010</ref>) have been successfully detected. For the analysis of NCBI samples, some filter constrains have been set to be less stringent with respect to CML samples, because of the specific characteristics of NCBI dataset in terms of coverage and presence of readthroughs. In particular, the threshold on the number of encompassing in the supported candidate thresholding filter was set to 2, since a lower coverage may cause a smaller number of supporting encompassing reads (see<ref type="figure">Table 5</ref>). Furthermore, the threshold for the neighbor candidate filter was set to 50 bp to account for the larger number of readthroughs in this dataset.The fusion sequence corresponding to BCR and ABL1 genes is reported as well as the group of reads spanning the junction boundary. The exons involved into the fusion are also indicated in correspondence of the fusion boundary points<ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 8</ref>depicts the results of the exact junction breakpoint analysis applied to CML samples. A group of reads is mapped onto the reference genome spanning the fusion boundary between the BCR and ABL1 genes. This chimera has been validated through RT–PCR analysis. The spanning reads reported in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 8</ref>show a ladder-like pattern across the junction boundary according to the junction model we use in this work. The exons involved in the fusion are exon 14 (s_4), exon 1(s_7) and exon 13 (s_8) of BCR and exon 2 of ABL1.For instance, Bellerophontes identifies a fusion involving EWSR1 gene (chr22:29664273-29669806) and a not annotated gene (namely, CufflinksNovelGene chr14: 3635033736350395). This feature is relevant for the detection of new aberrant modifications in the gene regulation, which is one of the main targets of next-generation sequencing analysis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Effects of filters on candidate fusions</head><p>The considerable number of initial candidates detected in the first phase by discordant read mapping (up to 122 931 in s_8 sample) is consistently reduced through the pipeline of filters shown in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>. A large fraction of candidates is discarded because it was not supported by a sufficient number of encompassing reads (see third column in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>). Moreover, 32%–37% of putative fusions with a sufficient number of encompassing reads has been removed because of abnormal inner size and asymmetry in consensus regions. Because of its large computational cost due to the reverse remapping of the encompassing reads, the homologous sequence artifacts filter has been applied as a final step on a reduced set of candidates. This filter was very selective, leaving 3%–8% of putative candidates for the following spanning analysis phase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Effects of filters on junction artifacts</head><p>Both alignment bias and biological artifacts due to PCR amplification might cause the detection of false putative junctions. In order to mitigate the negative effects of these events on the chimeric transcript analysis, the filters described in Section 2.1.3 are applied during the exact junction breakpoint analysis phase.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 9</ref>reports the effect of the application of the filters on the initial number of putative junctions detected for each sample. The initial number of junctions (i.e. spanning reads) is in general larger than the candidates resulted from the first encompassing analysis phase of the tool, since each candidate has multiple spanning reads associate to it. The floating fragment removal filter does not reduce the number of the initial putative junctions. However, it plays a fundamental role for the following PCR artifacts removal filter. In fact, the floating fragments cause false ladder-like patters that are actually replicas of the same reads (see<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 6</ref>). The floating fragment removal filter removes the floating fragments and it allows a more accuratedetection of PCR artifacts. Therefore, the PCR artifacts removal filter removes from the 9 to 20% of false putative junctions and the number of junctions ranges in the best case (sample s_8) from 427 to 339. Moreover, the removal of the floating fragments makes in some cases to considerably decrease the number of reads spanning across the putative junction (see<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 6</ref>). Consequently, the 'supported junctions thresholding' filter is more effective after applying floating fragment removal filter and the reduction spans from 39 to 62%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Comparative analysis</head><p>To highlight that the proposed approach provides results comparable with state-of-art tools while it introduces original features improving fusion discovery, we compared Bellerophontes analysis with deFuse (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">McPherson et al., 2011</ref>) on both CML samples and a published dataset. This represents a very recent fusion detection tool using paired-end reads. Its basic version has been shown to improve other tools such as FusionSeq (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Sboner et al., 2010</ref>) and MapSplice (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Wang et al., 2010</ref>) in detecting experimentally validated fusions. We applied deFuse version 0.4.2 with defaults options for the analysis on CML samples. We also compare public results in<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">McPherson et al. (2011)</ref>with our results on the NCBI datasets.<ref type="figure">Table 4</ref>shows the final number of fusions predicted with Bellerophontes and deFuse on CML samples. This table also reports the number of encompassing and spanning reads for BCRABL1 fusion (validated through RT–PCR). The number of predicted fusions by deFuse is higher for all the samples. While implementing more selective filters Bellerophontes still detects BCR-ABL1 with a comparable number of encompassing and spanning. We note that there are several deFuse-unique fusions that are supported by a low number of spanning reads (i.e. &lt;8). Those fusions are discarded by Bellerophontes because of the supported candidate thresholding filter, whose threshold was set to 8. The smaller number of predicted fusions is also due to the usage of Cufflinks to map the discordant read mates. Indeed, only candidates with a minimum level of abundance are considered, reducing the set of possible fused genes to be evaluated in the successive stages of the pipeline. Indeed, we observed that most of the candidates provided by deFuse have been discarded by Bellerophontes because the related genes are filtered out by Cufflinks with default parameters, due to their low abundance. Note that, if we are interested in detecting junctions between poorly expressed candidates, it is possible to run Cufflinks with less restrictiveWe also performed a comparative analysis of Bellerophontes against deFuse, TopHat-Fusion (http://tophat-fusion.sourceforge. net) and Chimerascan (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Iyer et al., 2011</ref>), on the CML samples. All of them recognized BCR–ABL1 and provided a set of additional fusions. Interestingly, there was almost no overlap among all the tools in respect of these additional fusions (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10</ref>). For this reason, most of them are likely to be false-positive. It can be noted that Bellerophontes has the smaller set of this additional fusions. Finally, we in order to further evaluate the performance of the proposed method we performed analysis on an additional dataset, that is MCF7 cell line by<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Edgren et al. (2011)</ref>, for which we found all the validated fusions, namely, BCAS4-BCAS3, ARFGEF2-SULF2 and RPS6KB1-TMEM49.</p></div>

RNA-Seq data analysis framework for chimeric transcripts 

gene fusion model. The model, based on validated 
experimental evidence, is implemented by Bellerophontes 
through a set of modular filters. 

@BULLET It integrates a splicing-driven alignment and abundance 
estimation analysis, leading to a more accurate set of 
reads supporting the junction discovery because it reduces 
ambiguous assignments of reads to isoforms and allows 
the detection of novel fused transcripts. Furthermore, this 
approach allows to account for those transcripts that are 
consistently expressed in the sample under study, even if they 
are not annotated. 

@BULLET The full pipeline has been developed on top of a splicing-
driven alignment. As a result, encompassing reads are mapped 
more accurately even in presence of proximal splice junctions. 
This enhances the accuracy of reads supporting fusion 
candidate detection and junction sequence discovery. 

To achieve these targets, Bellerophontes leverages upon 
algorithms such </table></figure>

			<note place="foot">* All the library identifiers, with exception of the last row, refer to the accession number reporting the SRR prefix in the NCBI databank. A similar effect can be noted on the analysis of spanning reads supporting the junctions. By taking splicing events into consideration, Bellerophontes obtain a more robust detection of the exact junction sequence, which becomes evident especially where the number of supporting reads is poor. Note that the number of encompassing and spanning reads represent a discriminatory factor to conduct a successive experimental validation of the data provided by the software analysis. The improved accuracy revealed another positive effect, that is the final number of detected fusions, even in the most covered libraries (s_7 and s_8), is compatible with a cost sensitive experimental validation. Moreover, in s_8 three fusions involving non-annotated genes are detected. To improve selectivity, the pipeline integrates a set of filters, embedding a new and more effective junction model. Indeed, this filter discards a large number of candidates. Finally, results about spanning read filtering and spanning-encompassing coherence check highlight that a junction filtering is a critical step to provide an accurate set of junctions. Note that in all the CML samples Bellerophontes was able to detect the expected and validated BCR–ABL1 fusion even in a selective filtering context. Comparative results obtained on both CML and NCBI dataset show that Bellerophontes is able to accurately detect gene fusions and improves the accuracy of spanning reads with respect to deFuse. This cross-benchmarking was performed since deFuse presented the most complete biological validation and it has shown to improve state-of-art tools like FusionSeq (Sboner et al., 2010). The results indicate that deFuse is not able to detect chimeric transcripts involving non-annotated genes present in s_8. On the other side, Bellerophontes is much more selective, reducing the total number of fusion candidates with respect to deFuse (see Table 4). Bellerophontes is based on pair-end reads. Other recently proposed approaches such as FusionMap (Ge et al., 2011) exploit long single-end reads spanning the junction. Compared to FusionMap, our framework includes the support for new transcripts and the accurate mapping in presence of alternative splicing events.</note>

Note also that the set of candidates given by deFuse is not a superset of our candidates, this means that we find some candidates, that deFuse does not find, having a relevant expression. To quantify the impact of Cufflinks, we performed experiments with relaxed parameters. We observed an increasing number of fusions in common with deFuse, up to 85%. We do not state that these additional fusions are false positives. Rather, we believe that it is of interest of the biologist to be able to distinguish between fusions involving more or less expressed transcripts, because this may be correlated with protein expression analysis. The number of encompassing and spanning reads in s_4 sample is comparable for both the tools, whereas for the s_7 sample deFuse presents an higher coverage. This is mainly due to the different alignment programs (Bowtie for deFuse and TopHat for Bellerophontes) and to the usage of Cufflinks transcript annotations in the proposed pipeline. In particular, our alignment and annotation methodology reduces the probability of multiple matches, which may lead to candidates with higher read coverage but not really expressed. On the other side, considering results in, in case of fusions ANKHD1-C5orf32 (sample 018260), C1orf61-CCT3 and MIXL1-PARP1 (sample 018266), we observe a larger number of spanning reads supporting the validated junction. The number of spanning reads strongly depends on the splicing detection algorithm. Bellerophontes integrates TopHat in its pipeline, which allows to improve the quality of spanning reads detection. This becomes evident especially in case of junctions where deFuse shows a poor spanning reads coverage. For instance, in the case of sample s_8 (see) of CML dataset and sample 018260 (see), the number of Bellerophontes detected spanning is considerably higher compared to deFuse. This result is coherent with the experimental validation [the fusion in the 018260 sample is validated with RT–PCR (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Berger et al., 2010)]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DISCUSSION</head><p>The proposed framework implements a new analysis pipeline that exploits effective alignment and annotation algorithms as well as a filtering stage based on an accurate modeling of the junction. RNASeq data analysis presents major challenges concerning ambiguous assignments of reads to isoforms that can impact fusion detection. Indeed, fusion candidates are discovered by means of encompassing reads. As such, the accuracy in detection of discordant mates is a key feature of a fusion detection pipeline. Bellerophontes introduces a new approach where reads are mapped on experimental determined transcripts rather than using a reference genome, thus reducing the probability of multiple matches that may affect state-of-art fusion detection tools based on basic alignment algorithms.</p></div>			</div>

			<abstract>
				<p>We present a significantly improved version of the flowType and RchyOptimyx BioConductor-based pipeline that is both 14 times faster and can accommodate multiple levels of biomarker expression for up to 96 markers. With these improvements, the pipeline is positioned to be an integral part of data analysis for high-throughput experiments on high-dimensional single-cell assay platforms, including flow cytometry, mass cytometry and single-cell RT-qPCR.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Flow cytometry has undergone a 'chromatic explosion' over the past decade and can now measure 17 markers at once for each of hundreds of thousands of individual cells (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chattopadhyay et al., 2008</ref>). Since then, mass cytometry has enabled measurement of 30–45 markers/cell (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bendall et al., 2012</ref>), whereas single-cell multiplexed RT-qPCR can measure 50–96 messenger RNAs/cell (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">White et al., 2011</ref>). The growth in high-throughput single-cell data continues to outpace development of corresponding bioinformatics techniques (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chattopadhyay et al., 2008</ref>). To answer this challenge, we previously developed flowType (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aghaeepour et al., 2012a</ref>) and RchyOptimyx (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Aghaeepour et al., 2012b</ref>). FlowType uses partitioning of cells, either manually or by clustering, into positive or negative for each marker to enumerate all cell types in a sample, e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aghaeepour et al. (2013)</ref>. RchyOptimyx measures the importance of these cell types by correlating their abundance to external outcomes, such as disease state or patient survival, and distills the identified phenotypes to their simplest possible form. These packages have been used to identify several novel cell populations correlated with HIV outcome (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aghaeepour et al., 2012a</ref>). More recently, this pipeline has been used to evaluate standardized immunological panels (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Villanova et al., 2013</ref>), to optimize lymphoma diagnosis (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Craig et al., 2013</ref>) and to analyze a range of other clinical data (unpublished data). However, the higher dimensionality of data produced by mass cytometry generates up to 3 45 % 10 21 possible cell types, with an even greater number (up to 3 96 % 10 45 ) for single-cell qPCR; these magnitudes are beyond the capabilities of flowType and RchyOptimyx. Furthermore, flowType and RchyOptimyx have thus far only treated cells as being either positive or negative for a marker. In practice, many biomarkers can have a range of expression levels such as 'dim' and 'bright'. In this application note, we detail architectural improvements to flowType and RchyOptimyx to overcome these limitations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">APPROACH</head><p>Our primary challenge was to enable flowType to generate a number of cell types tractable on most common workstations (e.g. those with 4–12 GB of RAM). We hereafter denote the original flowType implementation as flowType-BF (brute force) and the new version as flowType-DP (dynamic programming). Whereas flowType-BF completely enumerates all cell types over all ½1, :::, m markers, we opted in flowType-DP to use a breadthfirst strategy of enumerating all cell types defined over a subset of k m markers. We provide a memory use estimation function to assist users in finding a k that fits within the limits of their hardware. To improve computation time in flowType-DP, we implemented a dynamic programming approach, which exploits the fact that cell types can be arranged into a hierarchy, and membership of any given cell type over n markers is equal to the intersection of one of its parent types (over nÀ1 markers) with a singlemarker cell type. FlowType-DP first enumerates all cell types involving only one marker by simple partitioning and then iterates over 2, :::, k markers, computing all cell types for each level n by set intersections between corresponding cell types in levels nÀ1 and 1.To allow partitioning into levels other than positive and negative, we used a string representation for cell types. The string has *To whom correspondence should be addressed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>y</head><p>The authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the first three authors should be regarded as joint First Authors. one integer character for every marker, denoting the partition, or zero if the marker is not used. Values 1, :::, n denote partitions 1 to n. For example, if the set of markers were fCD3, CD45, CD13, CD117, CD34g, the cell type CD45 þþ CD117 þ CD34 À would be represented by 03021. RchyOptimyx uses a dynamic programing algorithm for efficiently constructing k-shortest paths (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Eppstein, 1998</ref>). We modified RchyOptimyx' graph construction component to be able to handle more than one partition per marker.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>We evaluated flowType-DP against flowType-BF on a 10marker dataset available from Flow Repository (ID FR-FCMZZZK) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aghaeepour et al., 2012a</ref>). FlowType-DP showed a substantial speedup over flowType-BF, which increases exponentially with the number of cells and markers. For example, at 10 6 cells and 10 markers, flowType-DP is 14 times faster (see<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1a and b</ref>). Comparison on larger datasets was not possible due to the limitations of flowType-BF. We also computed the limits for k on a hypothetical machine with 12 GB of RAM for samples representative of mass cytometry (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1c</ref>) and polychromatic flow cytometry (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1d</ref>), both of which would be intractable for flowType-BF. FlowType and RchyOptimyx are now able, within the memory of a common workstation (12 GB), to analyze 34-marker data. Finally, to demonstrate the importance of several partitions per marker, we applied flowType and RchyOptimyx to an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) sample from Flow Repository (ID FRFCM-ZZYA) (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1e and f</ref>). CD34 is a stem cell marker typically expressed on AML blast cells. These blasts are also known to have dimly positive CD45 expression and low side scatter (SSC) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Vial and Lacombe, 2001</ref>). By partitioning CD45 and SSC into four and three partitions and naively running flowType and RchyOptimyx to search for CD34-enriched cell types, we were able to find that the SSC low CD45 dim cell type had a high proportion of CD34 þ cells, as expected. This would not have been possible with only two partitions for each of CD45 and SSC.

				<p>Motivation: Gene prediction in metagenomic sequences remains a difficult problem. Current sequencing technologies do not achieve sufficient coverage to assemble the individual genomes in a typical sample; consequently, sequencing runs produce a large number of short sequences whose exact origin is unknown. Since these sequences are usually smaller than the average length of a gene, algorithms must make predictions based on very little data. Results: We present MetaProdigal, a metagenomic version of the gene prediction program Prodigal, that can identify genes in short, anonymous coding sequences with a high degree of accuracy. The novel value of the method consists of enhanced translation initiation site identification, ability to identify sequences that use alternate genetic codes and confidence values for each gene call. We compare the results of MetaProdigal with other methods and conclude with a discussion of future improvements.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Metagenomes from environmental samples can contain thousands of species and often cannot be sequenced to sufficient coverage to assemble each individual genome. Even with enough coverage, the correct binning and assembly of the various sequences still present many challenges, making it likely that at least for the immediate future, metagenomic sequencing will continue to produce a large number of small contigs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Challenges in short, anonymous sequences</head><p>Various sequencing technologies, such as 454, Illumina and Sanger, can produce reads anywhere from 50 to 41000 bp when analyzing a typical metagenomic sample. In the first case, gene identification becomes extremely difficult; in the latter case, genes can be predicted rather well. In addition, sequencing errors, particularly the insertions and deletions common to 454, can have a profound negative impact on metagenomic gene prediction (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hoff, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Rho et al., 2010</ref>). In reality, there are two problems in metagenomic gene prediction. The first problem, which we call the anonymous sequence problem, is that the genome from which the sequence was derived is unknown. The second problem, which we will refer to as the short sequence problem, is that the sequences are shorter than the length of an average gene, and therefore, many fragments contain genes that run off one or both edges of the contig. Although many methods treat these two problems together, and, indeed, the second problem does exacerbate the first, in reality, they are two separate issues. Short sequences present challenges even for draft contigs in a single genome, particularly in the identification of edge genes, and long sequences whose origin is unknown can still prove difficult to analyze as accurately as if the genome was known. Many programs have been developed to solve these problems and identify genes in metagenomic fragments, including Metagene (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Noguchi et al., 2006</ref>), Metagene Annotator (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Noguchi et al., 2008</ref>), MetaGeneMark (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Zhu et al., 2010</ref>), Orphelia (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hoff et al., 2008</ref>) and FragGeneScan (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Rho et al., 2010</ref>). Although these methods perform well, none of them specializes in identifying translation initiation sites and none of them is able to correctly identify sequences derived from the Mycoplasma genus, which uses an alternate genetic code that translates UGA to tryptophan (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Yamao et al., 1985</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">The Prodigal gene prediction program</head><p>The gene prediction program Prodigal was introduced in 2007 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hyatt et al., 2010</ref>). Prodigal achieves good performance in identifying genes and translation initiation sites in finished genomes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Angelova et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">de Jong et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hyatt et al., 2010</ref>). The Joint Genome Institute uses Prodigal to annotate all its draft and finished genomes for the Department of Energy. Prodigal has been downloaded over 1000 times by users from 56 different countries and is in active use at numerous institutions around the world (data provided by analytics.google.com). Because Prodigal's training methodology already incorporates a great deal of information, including translation table, hexamer statistics, ribosomal binding site (RBS) motifs and upstream base composition, we sought to create extensions to the existing software that would handle metagenomic gene prediction, rather than to begin from nothing. Our idea was to create a variety of Prodigal training files covering all ranges of GC content, genetic codes, Eubacteria, Archaea, etc. and analyze an incoming *To whom correspondence should be addressed. fragment using one or more of these files. The resulting prediction would then be chosen based on the training file(s) that provided the best fit for a particular sequence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">The focus of MetaProdigal</head><p>In developing a metagenomic version of Prodigal, we chose to focus on optimizing performance for longer sequence lengths (700 bpþ), in the belief that sequencing, binning and assembly technologies will rapidly improve to the point where extremely short sequences are no longer the norm. Despite this focus, we still ensured our algorithm would perform reasonably well on shorter sequences. In addition, although we acknowledge the severe impact of sequencing errors on gene prediction, it proved too difficult to integrate the handling of insertions and deletions into the Prodigal framework. We also assert that frame shifts will become increasingly less of a problem with future improvements to sequencing and assembly technologies. In the meantime, FragGeneScan (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Rho et al., 2010</ref>) has demonstrated robust handling of insertions and deletions for those using 454. Our algorithm provides three novel contributions: (i) the incorporation of start site information into our training files, enabling excellent recognition of translation initiation sites, particularly at longer sequence lengths; (ii) the ability to predict genes in sequences from organisms that use an alternative genetic code (Mycoplasma) and (iii) the provision of confidence values, which can be used to filter gene predictions (useful when dealing with small gene fragments).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">MATERIALS AND METHODS</head><p>The first step in our algorithm was to develop a set of training files that could be used to score an anonymous coding sequence using the existing Prodigal algorithm. To generate these training files, we turned to NCBI's Refseq repository, which, as of September 2010, contained 1415 genome sequences of 500 000 bases or greater (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Pruitt et al., 2009</ref>). The idea was to partition all microbial Refseq into a set of clusters, where each cluster could be used to create a single training file. Rather than determining the number of clusters ahead of time, we hoped to establish a dissimilarity cutoff between clusters, such that we would halt the clustering process when the distance between the closest two clusters exceeded the established dissimilarity threshold. Before Refseq could be partitioned into clusters, we first needed to establish a distance measure between two genomes. Although various methods already existed for measuring the distance between two genomes, we decided instead to use a novel measure to calculate the distance between two genomes based on the Prodigal. The reason for choosing this method is that we wanted something computational and not biological in nature, such that we could be certain that, from Prodigal's perspective as a computer software, two genomes in the same cluster would be truly similar. We called this new measure gene prediction similarity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Gene prediction similarity</head><p>Prodigal can examine a single genome and record its statistics in a training file, which can then be used to analyze individual sequences from that genome. Given two genomes A and B, we can train Prodigal on genome A and then use that training file to predict genes in both genomes A and B. By examining how the predictions differ, we can measure the effective difference between the two genomes. We trained Prodigal on all 1415 microbial Refseq sequences individually. Next, for each training file, we predicted the genes in all the 1415 genomes. This resulted in 1415 Â 1415, or 2 002 225, runs, each of which took about 15 s on average, for a total of about 8000 processor hours. We performed these runs on a 64-node cluster with 512 AMD Opteron processors, enabling this run to finish in a single day. Once we had these results, we considered the diagonal of the 1415 Â 1415 matrix to be the baseline, i.e. the runs where Prodigal was trained and run on the same genome. We then needed a method for measuring the similarity between two sets of gene predictions, one in which Prodigal was trained and run on genome A and one in which Prodigal was trained on a different genome (B, for example) and run on genome A. We defined this to be the gene prediction similarity B ! A. For a given baseline prediction p, and a second set of predictions p 0 , we considered the number of correct matches M between the two predictions to be:<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>shows an example of gene prediction similarity calculations between Escherichia coli K12 and a variety of organisms. Prodigal was trained on each of these organisms and then run on E. coli, and the gene prediction similarity was calculated using the previously described formula. 'NG' indicates the number of genes predicted by the second training file. '3 0 M' and '5 0 M' indicate the number of genes that match a stop codon and start codon in the E. coli predictions. 'XB' indicates the (a 0 þ d 0 )/600 term in the match equation and indicates the number of genes we are penalizing from the final result. The next column, 'M,' represents the number of matches, which we then divide by 4313 (the number of genes in the E. coli prediction) to get the sensitivity and by the number in the first column (NG) to get the precision. The final gene prediction similarity is then the harmonic mean of Sn and Pr. Note that in the cases marked with an asterisk, we applied the alternative formula described above for calculating M, since 590% of the starts were correct (i.e. 5 0 M/3 0 M 5 0.9). Observing Table 1, we can see that E. coli S88 produced gene predictions extremely close to the original, which is to be expected for the same species. The highly similar Salmonella enterica also performed extremely well. The two Archaea proved to be quite distant, especially A. pernix with its TTG start motif. Finally, Mycoplasma bovis performed the worst of the entries in this table, due to using a completely different genetic code. Clostridium difficile proved interesting, as it failed to predict many real genes ($15%) in E. coli, but the genes it did predict were mostly correct (98% Sp).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Complete-linkage clustering of Refseq</head><p>Having obtained a reliable distance measure, we built the 1415 Â 1415 distance matrix for all sequences above 500 000 bp in microbial Refseq. Note that some of these sequences were chromosomes belonging to the same genome, but we kept these separate because we found it interesting to examine gene prediction similarities within multiple chromosomes in a single genome. The distances in this matrix could be used for a variety of purposes beyond the scope of this article, such as building phylogenetic trees or establishing cutoffs to delineate species, genus and family boundaries. Next, we clustered the sequences using an algorithm similar to complete-linkage clustering, in which, at each step, the two clusters are merged whose farthest neighbors are the closest (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Massaro, 2005</ref>). We chose this method to avoid the problem of population bias in Genbank, where more strains of one organism (for example, E. coli) have been sequenced than another. This makes merging clusters of different sizes using various weighted average distance methods difficult. When calculating the distance between two clusters, we examined the new cluster that would be created by merging them. For each point in the potential new cluster, we located the point farthest away from it, i.e. the one with the lowest gene prediction similarity, which corresponded to the sequence least recognized by the initial data point. We then chose the data point that had the 'best' such distance, which can be roughly thought of as the central-most point in the merged cluster. We label this sequence as the 'recognizer' of the cluster. An example cluster using these concepts is illustrated in<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, in which Pseudomonas aeruginosa would be chosen as the recognizer for the cluster based on its worst gene prediction similarity being better than that of the other two organisms. At each step of the clustering algorithm, the two closest clusters were merged, until only one cluster comprising all 1415 sequences remained. After the clustering was completed, we examined the similarity cutoffs and found that the score dropped below 95% when going from 51 to 50 clusters. Therefore, with 50 training files, a gene prediction similarity of 95% or better would be guaranteed across all microbial GenBank. We then trained MetaProdigal on the sequences in these 50 clusters, resulting in 50 training files that could be used to recognize anonymous coding sequences. A detailed list of the 50 clusters (with their best recognizer) is provided in Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Shine and Dalgarno, 1975</ref>), and 18 genomes (many of them are Cyanobacteria, Chlorobi or Archaea) did not. GC content of the 50 genomes ranged from 29.3 to 69.8%. The five largest clusters consisted of 262, 232, 184, 130 and 98 genomes, respectively, accounting for 64% of the 1415 sequences in GenBank, with the remaining 45 clusters covering the other 36%. Despite the top five clusters being very large, the average gene prediction similarities of their recognizers was over 98.5%. The 50 genomes roughly subdivided into<ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. Example of best worst distance and recognizer in cluster 3% GC intervals, with a Shine-Dalgarno-using bacterium, a non-ShineDalgarno bacterium (such as a Cyanobacteria or Chlorobi) and an Archaeum at each interval. One can see from the supplementary table that many clusters are devoted to small numbers of 'unusual' genomes, with a relatively small number of clusters covering the common organisms such as E. coli, Pseudomonas, etc. In fact, 26 of the 50 clusters contained five or fewer genomes. An open question would be if devoting so many training files for recognizing such a small number of genomes is worthwhile. An alternative approach would delve into more detail on the larger clusters, splitting them further. As noted in the previous paragraph, however, recognition of even the largest clusters was already at 98.5%, so it is questionable if one could really get a significant improvement by doing so.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Using the Prodigal training files for metagenomic analysis</head><p>By using the 50 training files, an input sequence can be scored with the standard Prodigal dynamic programming algorithm for finished genomes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hyatt et al., 2010</ref>). Since the Prodigal dynamic programming function returns a numerical score, the algorithm can run an input sequence through each of the 50 training files and output only the best result. However, this approach presents two drawbacks: (i) increased computation time (50 times a normal Prodigal run) and (ii) increased false-positive rate at shorter sequence lengths due to sampling multiple training files. To address the first drawback, MetaProdigal calculates the GC content for an incoming fragment and runs only on the training files within a given range of GC content relative to the fragment GC (a configurable parameter). To address the second drawback, we implemented a series of penalties for each gene in a sequence based on the length of the input sequence, the number of training files used to score the sequence and the length of the gene being scored. The principle of these penalties is similar to that of a Bonferroni correction (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bonferroni, 1935</ref>), in which a score is corrected based on the number of tested hypotheses (in this case, each test is a training file). Such a correction was only necessary in shorter sequences (5500 bp), where a lack of sufficient information resulted in greater volatility when using multiple training models to score a gene. One novel contribution of our algorithm is the calculation of confidence scores for each gene. Since the MetaProdigal score represents the log of the likelihood of this gene to be real versus background (i.e. a gene 1000Â more likely to be real than false would have a score of ln(1000)), the score can be converted to a percent value between 0 and 100 exclusive using the logistic function</p><formula>C ¼ e s =ð1 þ e s Þ;</formula><p>where C is the confidence value and s is the Prodigal score for that gene. We will examine the performance of this confidence score in the Results. The algorithm for the MetaProdigal is illustrated in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. A sequence arrives on standard input, the lower and upper GC content bounds for the fragment are established, and the full dynamic programming is performed using only training files trained on genomes with GC content in the specified range. The highest scoring set of gene models is selected and output to the user, along with confidence scores for each gene and detailed information about the training file used (genetic code used, Shine-Dalgarno preferences, etc.). In addition, as in the regular version of Prodigal, protein translations, DNA sequences and detailed information about every potential start site in the sequence can be output on request. As a result of running a full dynamic programming algorithm multiple times, which admittedly is complete overkill on short fragments, MetaProdigal is somewhat slow compared with existing programs like MetaGene Annotator and MetaGeneMark (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Noguchi et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Zhu et al., 2010</ref>). However, the finished genome version only took $15–20 sec to analyze a typical 4M bp genome on a single processor, so, even running on five to six training files per sequence, the metagenomic version can analyze 4M worth of data in about 100 s. A 1 GB sample could be analyzed in 7 h on a single processor at this rate, which, in our experience, is an acceptable turnaround time, especially given the ease by which the sample could be divided and run on multiple processors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RESULTS</head><p>Assessing the performance of metagenomic gene prediction tools remains a difficult task, due to the lack of experimentally verified gene sets. Tools such as Metagene Annotator, MetaGeneMark, Orphelia and FragGeneScan, have compared their predicted results with GenBank annotations (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hoff et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Noguchi et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Rho et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Zhu et al., 2010</ref>). By using this method, complete genomes from Refseq are sampled to a certain level of coverage at various fragment sizes (either with or without simulated errors), and the predicted results are compared with the positions of the GenBank-annotated genes in the fragments. Unfortunately, this methodology has one significant drawback. Since the gene calls in Refseq have not been experimentally verified, it is likely some of them are incorrect. Error rates have been shown to be greater in genomes containing high GC content (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Angelova et al., 2010</ref>). In addition, some translation initiation site predictions are likely to be incorrect as well, which could have an impact on gene predictions as fragment sizes become smaller. Nonetheless, the chosen genomes represent a good cross section across bacteria, Archaea and all levels of GC content. Therefore, we decided to analyze the results of MetaProdigal on the 50 genome set from the MetaGeneMark publication, according to the same standards described previously (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Zhu et al., 2010</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Gene prediction performance on an errorless simulated dataset</head><p>In the first analysis, we measured the performance of several methods at locating genes in an errorless simulated dataset. In this dataset, we did not consider the performance of programs on identifying translation initiation sites, because the error rate of start site predictions in the Genbank files is likely too high to make such a test meaningful (we examine start site performance separately in the next section). Each of the 50 sequences in the MetaGeneMark set was randomly sampled to 5Â coverage in four different fragment sizes: 150, 300, 700 and 1200 bp. Sequencing errors were not considered for this analysis. In addition, one genome was added to the 50 Refseq sequences, namely that of Mycoplasma leachii. Since $2% of the finished genomes in GenBank are Mycoplasma (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Benson et al., 2011</ref>), adding one Mycoplasma to a set of 50 sequences seemed like a reasonableaddition. This genome was added to the set to demonstrate how MetaProdigal can distinguish between genetic code 4 (used by Mycoplasma) and genetic code 11 (the standard microbial code) and achieve good performance on both types of genomes. Neither MetaGeneMark nor MetaGene Annotator possesses this capability, and both programs performed poorly on the M. leachii genome. A complete list of the 51 sequences used to evaluate the algorithms can be found in Supplementary Table S2. As described above, genes 560 bp, whether partial or complete, were not considered. The programs were only evaluated on their ability to predict genes of 60 bp or more in length. Regardless of the amount of coding present in a fragment, only the stop codon (or correct frame in the absence of a stop codon) and 60 bp of shared coding were required; the start codon was not required to match the predicted start in the Genbank file. For this analysis, we created a special version of MetaProdigal in which we excluded the 51 genomes in our test set from the clustering and training process; however, for the release version, these genomes were added back in to the training process.<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>shows the results of four methods: finished genome Prodigal, MetaProdigal, MetaGeneMark and MetaGene Annotator. The finished genome version of Prodigal (labeled as Prodigal_Finished in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>) was run to observe how closely the metagenomic version could match a version trained on the actual genome. In this analysis, the sensitivity, precision and F-score were calculated separately for each of the 51 sequences and then averaged together to produce the numbers in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. We define sensitivity to be TP/(TP þ FN), precision to be TP/(TP þ FP) and F-score to be the harmonic mean of the precision and sensitivity, or 2pr/( p þ r). In the longer fragment lengths, it is clear that MetaProdigal performs very closely to a version trained on the actual genomes (0.4 difference in F-score at 1200 bp, 0.7 at 700 bp, 1.5 at 300 bp and 3.2 at 150 bp). The implication is that for longer sequence lengths, such as 2000 bp, MetaProdigal identifies genes nearly as well as if it had actually been trained on the full reference genome. At the 700 and 1200 bp sequence lengths, MetaProdigal outperforms MetaGeneMark and MetaGene Annotator both in sensitivity and precision. At 300 and 150 bp, MetaProdigal still has better sensitivity and precision than MetaGene Annotator, but MetaGeneMark achieves a lower false-positive rate and better overall accuracy at 150 bp. Based on our results, it appears that MetaProdigal performs better at sequence lengths 250–300 bp and above, whereas MetaGeneMark, due to a lower false-positive rate, achieves a better F-score at lengths 5250 bp. We view the two programs (MetaProdigal and MetaGene Mark) as quite complementary on smaller sequences, however, as MetaProdigal seems to preserve sensitivity as sequence lengths grow shorter, whereas MetaGeneMark sacrifices sensitivity to preserve precision. At all four sequence lengths, overall accuracy was within 1% between MetaProdigal and MetaGeneMark, which may well lie in the margin of error based on incorrectly called genes in the Refseq annotations. However, it is likely that both programs perform better than MetaGene Annotator at identifying genes. In the particular case of M. leachii, the genome we added to the MetaGeneMark set, the MetaProdigal achieved 95.3% sensitivity and 94.3% precision even in the 150 bp fragments, whereas MetaGeneMark and MetaGene Annotator managed only 78.1 and 83.6% sensitivity, respectively. In 1200 bp fragments, MetaGeneMark and MetaGene locate most of the stop codons, but, because Mycoplasma translates TGA, they often only find the 3 0-end of the gene and split the true gene into many smaller genes. Therefore, the precision in 1200 bp fragments for MetaGeneMark and MetaGene was only 69 and 66%, respectively, whereas MetaProdigal had 98% sensitivity and 97.3% precision MetaProdigal can distinguish anonymous coding sequences using the Mycoplasma genetic code without sacrificing performance on the sequences that use the standard genetic code, which is a novel capability of the program compared with other methods. Recent publications have considered combining gene prediction methods for better results (<ref type="bibr">Yok and Rosen, 2011</ref>). Although examining more elaborate methods of combining MetaProdigal and MetaGeneMark gene predictions is beyond the scope of this article, however, we did benchmark the performance of the intersection of the gene sets predicted by each program. These data are presented in the 'Combined' column insensitivity dropped, the precision of the predictions improved dramatically, exceeding even that of the finished genome version of Prodigal. Even at 150 bp, the precision of the set of genes predicted by both MetaGeneMark and MetaProdigal remained above 95%. These data highlight the advantages of using multiple methods to obtain a set of high confidence gene models. Even though MetaProdigal's performance is similar to MetaGeneMark's individually, the inclusion of another method still provides substantial value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Translation initiation site prediction performance on an experimentally verified gene set</head><p>Start site identification in metagenomic sequences has not been studied much in the literature, although programs such as MetaTISA have been built to address this problem (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hu et al., 2009</ref>). Although the primary focus remains finding the genes themselves, it is still desirable to locate as many translation initiation sites correctly as possible. The problem is complicated by the fact that some organisms use Shine-Dalgarno ribosomal binding site (RBS) motifs, whereas others, such as Cyanobacteria and Chlorobi, do not appear to use RBS motifs at all (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hyatt et al., 2010</ref>). Regardless of the presence or absence of an RBS motif, one of the 50 training files used in the metagenomic version of Prodigal will likely assign that start site a positive score, because both SD and non-SD organisms are included. To assess start site performance, we took the dataset from the Prodigal publication, containing 2443 genes (<ref type="bibr">Aivaliotis et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hyatt et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Rudd, 2000</ref>). The genomes were randomly sampled in five fragment sizes: 150, 300, 700, 1200 and 3000 bp, with the restriction that the fragment must contain at least 60 bp of 1 of the 2443 experimentally verified genes. We added the longer fragment size to illustrate the continuing increase in start site accuracy as more information becomes available. Again, for this analysis, we used a special version of MetaProdigal that had not been trained on any of the genomes in this dataset; however, we did include these genomes in the training process for the final release version (resulting in much higher performance on some of the Archaea). The performance on this dataset is given in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>. The results of the regular version of Prodigal are again shown for comparison (in the 'Prodigal Finished' column) as a best achievable result for the metagenomic program.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><figDesc>S1.

			<note place="foot">M ¼ ðm À ðða þ d Þ=600:0ÞÞ; where m is the number of genes in p and p 0 that share a stop codon, a is the number of bases in the second prediction not contained in the first prediction for only the genes that share a stop codon and d is the number of bases in the first prediction not contained in the second prediction for only the genes that share a stop codon. The idea was to calculate the average distance between start codons and penalize 10% for every 60 bp difference (distances4600 bp in a single gene were reduced to 600 bp, i.e. we could not penalize 4100% per gene). For example, if 1500 genes that share a stop codon differed by 30 bp on average in their start site predictions, then, instead of 1500 correct identifications, we counted them as 95% of 1500 or 1425. The reason for this modification was to allow differences in translation initiation site prediction to be incorporated into the clustering model. In addition, we made one further modification that if the predictions failed to achieve a 90% perfect match in start sites among genes that shared a stop codon, we instead labeled every mismatch as only half correct. For example, if genome B correctly predicted 1500 genes (stop codons) in A, but only 1200 of those 1500 genes (80%) matched perfectly (start and stop codon), the match count M would be set to 1200 þ 300 Â 0.5 ¼ 1350. The idea behind this rule was to detect cases such as Aeropyrum pernix, which preferentially chooses TTG as its start codon (Kawabarayasi et al., 1999). When using another organism to predict the genes in A. pernix, the second organism frequently performed quite well at finding the stop codons and would even predict genes of approximately the same size, choosing a nearby ATG whenever available (because ATG is preferred in the second organism&apos;s training file). However, only $50–60% of the genes matched perfectly. We decided to penalize heavily for this situation, because the results indicated a substantially different preference in translation between the two organisms. Given the above information, we next needed to normalize the above value of M to be a number between 0 and 1. Therefore, we defined the &apos;gene prediction similarity D(A 0 !A)&apos; to be the F-score, or the harmonic mean of the sensitivity (M/n) and precision (M/n 0 ): DðA 0 ! AÞ ¼ 2M 2 =ðMn þ Mn 0 Þ; where n is the number of genes in A and n 0 is the number of genes in A 0. The only difference between this sensitivity and precision and that described in the Prodigal paper is that we penalized matching 3 0 genes for the distance between their start site predictions. It is worth noting that gene prediction similarity is not symmetrical. Although usually, A&apos;s ability to predict the genes in B is fairly close to B&apos;s ability to predict the genes in A, quite frequently one genome will predict genes quite well in its counterpart, while the opposing genome will do quite poorly on the first one.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="3">.3 Evaluating confidence measures for gene predictions Using the confidence measures described in Section 2, we can subdivide our results into confidence intervals and examine how sensitivity and precision change if we only consider high confidence genes, medium confidence genes, etc. Table 4 shows the results of this analysis for 300 bp and 700 bp fragments based on the MetaGeneMark dataset described in Section 3.1. In this table, the sensitivity (Sn), precision (Pr) and F-score correspond to the performance of the algorithm if only genes of that confidence level or higher were accepted. For example, Prodigal could achieve a 99.2% precision by accepting only genes with 100% confidence in 700 bp fragments, but it would fail to identify 40% of real genes with this stringent a restriction. At the longer sequence lengths, Prodigal&apos;s confidence score corresponds very well to the actual performance. For example, at 700 bp, 99.2% of genes with a 100% confidence score were true positives and 95% of genes with a confidence score of 90–99.99% were true positives. At the smaller sequence lengths (150 and 300 bp), however, the comparison worsens, and only 38.7% of genes in the 50–59% confidence interval were actually true positives, according to the Refseq annotations of our dataset. This suggests further room for improvement in the scoring function of the algorithm, particularly in our Bonferroni modifications to the scores (Bonferroni, 1935). Perhaps, the algorithm should eliminate more of the lower scoring genes or add more rules to penalize our score based on the fragment or gene length. However, we were reluctant to make changes based on a single dataset, because that could be considered to be fitting to the test set data. Examining these lower scoring genes on a larger dataset to see whether they should be kept is a worthwhile goal for future versions. Regardless of the actual performance, the confidence estimation gives researchers a valuable tool for deciding whether to retain or eliminate a given gene model. We believe this % confidence measure to be a significant improvement over a numerical score, the meaning of which can be often difficult to understand or apply to practical problems. 4 CONCLUSION We built an open source heuristic ab initio algorithm for metagenomic gene prediction using Prodigal. The program can analyze fragments independently and thereby achieve full speedup through utilization of multiple processors. Although we understand the problems posed by sequencing errors, we chose to focus instead on other problems that have received less attention, such as translation initiation site identification, handling of alternate genetic codes and providing filtering mechanisms for scores based on confidence. In future versions, we hope to address sequencing errors in more detail and provide further improvements to the program&apos;s performance at smaller fragment lengths.</note>

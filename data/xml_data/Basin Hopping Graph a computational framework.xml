				<p>Motivation: RNA folding is a complicated kinetic process. The minimum free energy structure provides only a static view of the most stable conformational state of the system. It is insufficient to give detailed insights into the dynamic behavior of RNAs. A sufficiently sophisticated analysis of the folding free energy landscape, however, can provide the relevant information. Results: We introduce the Basin Hopping Graph (BHG) as a novel coarse-grained model of folding landscapes. Each vertex of the BHG is a local minimum, which represents the corresponding basin in the landscape. Its edges connect basins when the direct transitions between them are &apos;energetically favorable&apos;. Edge weights endcode the corresponding saddle heights and thus measure the difficulties of these favorable transitions. BHGs can be approximated accurately and efficiently for RNA molecules well beyond the length range accessible to enumerative algorithms. Availability and implementation: The algorithms described here are implemented in Cþþ as standalone programs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Much of RNA's functional complexity is rooted not only in the details of its intricate 3D structure but also in its ability to adaptively acquire distinct conformations on its own or in response to specific cellular signals including the recognition of proteins, nucleic acids, metal ions, metabolites, vitamins, changes in temperature and even RNA biosynthesis itself. These conformational transitions are spatially and temporally tuned to achieve a variety of functions. The most obvious examples are riboswitches (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baumstark et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Perrotta and Been, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Schultes and Bartel, 2000</ref>) and RNA thermometers (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Klinkert and Narberhaus, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Narberhaus et al., 2006</ref>). The intricate structures of RNAs are typically modeled to a reasonable approximation in terms of secondary structures (<ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Thirumalai et al., 2001</ref>). This is because the thermal melting data (thermodynamic free energy model) of secondary structures have been interpreted by a nearest-neighbor model (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mathews et al., 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mathews et al., , 2004</ref>) and form the basis for widely used structure prediction algorithms that predict secondary structure with reasonable accuracy (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hofacker, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Zuker, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Zuker and Sankoff, 1984</ref>). In particular, the partition function of the Boltzmann ensemble of secondary structures for a given RNA sequence can be computed in cubic time using a well-known dynamic programming approach (<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">McCaskill, 1990</ref>). Thus, a stochastic backtracking algorithm (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ding and Lawrence, 2003</ref>) can be used to produce representative structures and to generate Boltzmann-weighted samples to assess complex structural features like base pair probabilities. The inclusion of pseudoknots and other tertiary contacts into RNA structure prediction remains time-consuming and technically challenging (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Das and Baker, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Rivas and Eddy, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Rother et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Smit et al., 2009</ref>). In its most general form, the problem is NP-complete (<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">ManˇuchManˇuch et al., 2011</ref>). Furthermore, free energy models for pseudoknots are based on sparse experimental data and hence are crude at best. Nevertheless, secondary structures with pseudoknots can be important for the dynamics of folding (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Isambert and Siggia, 2000</ref>). Owing to the journal's length restrictions, we focus on the Boltzmann ensemble of secondary structures in the main text and relegate the extension to structures with pseudoknots to Supplementary Material Part H. For brevity, we will speak of the 'energy' instead of 'free energy' of a secondary structure. The kinetic process of RNA folding can be described as a dynamic process in the molecule's energy landscape (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Flamm et al., 2002</ref>). The energy landscape is a particular network whose vertices represent all the possible structures and whose edges connect structures that can be interconverted by elementary rearrangements, typically the opening or closing of individual base pairs. For each structure as a vertex in the landscape, its energy is evaluated based on the thermodynamic energy model (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mathews et al., 1999</ref>) for characterizing its dynamical state. *To whom correspondence should be addressed. Thus, the transition rates between adjacent secondary structures can be estimated by the Metropolis rule (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Flamm et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Xayaphoummine et al., 2007</ref>). In this setting, the RNA folding process is viewed as a Markov chain, and the transition rates between two adjacent structures in the landscape are related with their energy differences. Typically, different structural transitions are of different rates as observed by<ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Smit et al. (2007)</ref>, which is consistent with the thermodynamic picture: the equilibrium distribution of this Markov process coincides with the Boltzmann distribution of the secondary structures. The number of different secondary structures, however, makes it impossible to enumerate the entire landscape except for short sequences, so that one has to resort to coarse-grained approximations. The barrier tree of the landscape,<ref type="figure">Figure 1B</ref>, encodes the local minima and their connecting energy barriers. The idea to elucidate the basin structure of a landscape by means of a barrier tree has been developed independently in different contexts, including potential energy surfaces for protein folding (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Garstecki et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Wales, 2011</ref>), spin glasses (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Klotz and Kobe, 1994</ref>) and molecular clusters (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Doye et al., 1999</ref>). The exact computation of barrier trees in general requires the enumeration of the landscape. For RNA secondary structures, a modification of the backtracking step in the dynamic programming folding algorithm can be used to enumerate only the lowest-lying fraction of the landscapes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Wuchty et al., 1999</ref>). However, even within this favorable setting, barrier trees are accessible only for RNA molecules with up to $100 nt. An alternative to the exact construction of barrier trees is the use of heuristic approaches. For example,<ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Tang et al. (2008)</ref>adopted computational techniques for motion planning in robotics to obtain an approximated representation of the RNA folding landscape. A different type of coarse graining can be obtained by conditioning the folding algorithms on the distances from two reference points, resulting in a kind of 2D 'projection' of the landscape (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lorenz et al., 2009</ref>). Heuristic methods are also used to (locally) navigate the optimal folding path between two given structures. For instance, findpath (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Flamm et al., 2000</ref>) is a fast algorithm that produces excellent quality direct pathways based on the Morgan–Higgs algorithm (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Morgan and Higgs, 1998</ref>). Furthermore, RNAtabupath (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dotu et al., 2010</ref>) and its related web server, RNApathfinder, used a tabu semi-greedy heuristic to determine nearly optimal folding pathways between two given secondary structures.<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lorenz et al. (2009)</ref>developed a heuristic algorithm PathFinder based on their 2D 'projection' of the landscape. The difficult part in computing coarse graining models such as barrier trees is to determine the saddle points. The local minima, on the other hand, can be obtained efficiently by means of modified dynamic programming algorithms. This was demonstrated first by<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Clote (2005)</ref>with respect to the Nussinov–Jacobson energy model and later extended to the Turner energy model by Lorenz and Clote (2011). Their extension of McCaskill's algorithm can be used to generate Boltzmann-weighted samples of local minima. Empirically, they find that the number of local optima is roughly the square root of the number of secondary structures, i.e. it grows exponentially with chain length. Exact combinatorial results have been derived by Fusy and Clote (2012) for the base stacking energy model, which is a variant of the Nussinov model, where each stacked base pair contributes À1 toward the energy of the structure. Hence, for large RNAs, one still has to resort to sampling. Boltzmann-weighted samples are not necessarily the most efficient way to explore the basin structure of the landscape because they are strongly biased toward usually small fraction of low energy structures. Sahoo and Albrecht (2012) thus considered a stochastic sampling method to obtain local minima within a prescribed distance of a reference structure: random structures are iteratively improved by gradient (down-hill) walks until local minima are reached. Such samples can be used to estimate the total number of local minima following the arguments of Garnier and Kallel (2000). The remainder of this contribution is organized as follows. In Sections 2.1 and 2.2, we first introduce the basic concepts and existing results in the field of RNA folding landscapes. In Section 2.3, we introduce the 'Basin Hopping Graph' (BHG) as a new coarse graining model of the energy landscape and then describe algorithms for its construction. In Section 3, we present and discuss our experimental results. Section 4 summarizes the article and suggests directions for future work.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">RNA folding landscapes</head><p>Given an RNA sequence , let X ¼ X denote the set of all secondary structures that can be formed by assuming that (i) only canonical (GC, AU and GU) base pairs are formed, (ii) base pairs do not cross, i.e. pseudoknots are not formed, and (iii) hairpin loops have a minimum length of 3. These conditions define the ensemble of structures implemented in the most commonly used RNA folding tools including mfold (<ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Zuker and Sankoff, 1984</ref>) and the ViennaRNA Package (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hofacker et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lorenz et al., 2011</ref>). It is well known that the cardinality jX j grows exponentially with the length of<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[(Hofacker et al., 1996</ref>) and the references therein] provided the stickiness of , i.e. the probability that two arbitrarily chosen nucleotides in can form a base pair, is relatively large. This is true for most biological RNA sequences, as the values of stickiness for RNAs are around 0.375 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hofacker et al., 1994</ref>). This set of discrete conformations is arranged as a graph by defining a 'move set', i.e. by specifying which pairs of secondary structures can be interconverted in a single step [(Reidys and A B<ref type="figure">Fig. 1.</ref>(A) Adjacency in an RNA folding landscape is encoded by insertion or deletion of a single base pair. The underlying graph of an RNA folding landscape is connected owing to the existence of the particular valid secondary structure that contains no base pair (open structure). (B) Schematics representation of an energy landscape and its associated barrier tree. Local minima are labeled with numbers (1–5), saddle points with lowercase letters (a–d). The global minimum is marked with an asterisk<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Stadler, 2002</ref>) and the references therein].<ref type="figure">Figure 1A</ref>gives a simple example. Each vertex of the RNA folding landscape, i.e. each RNA secondary structure x, is associated with an energy f(x). A well-established energy model allows us to explicitly compute f(x) for every structure x in terms of additive contributions for base pair stacking as well as hairpin loops, interior loops, bulges and multiloops (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mathews et al., 1999</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Local minima, saddles and basins</head><p>A secondary structure x 2 X is a local minimum (LM) of the landscape if it does not have neighbors with lower energy. In particular, x is a global minimum or a minimum free energy structure (MFE) if its energy is minimal within X. For each LM x, we define its gradient basin GðxÞ &amp; X as the set of structures z 2 X so that the unique gradient walk with starting point in z ends in x. We note for later reference that the gradient basins of all the LMs in the RNA folding landscape forms a partition of its configuration space X. This partitioning forms an intuitive coarsegrained model of the landscape. An important concept for our own approach is the direct saddle. A direct saddle between two LMs x and y is a structure s 2 X with minimal energy so that both x and y are reachable from s by means of an adaptive walk. We call DSðx, yÞ ¼ fðsÞ the direct saddle height between x and y. Not every pair of LMs is connected by direct saddles. However, the graph consisting of LMs and their connections by direct saddles is always connected (Supplementary Material Part A;<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Klemm et al., 2014</ref>). The cycle B h ðxÞ of x at energy level h can be defined as a maximal connected subset of fz 2 XjfðzÞ hg that contains x. In other words, B h ðxÞ is the set of structures found by a flooding algorithm starting at x (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Flamm et al., 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Flamm et al., , 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Sibani et al., 1999</ref>). In particular, the basin BðsÞ ¼ B fðsÞ ðsÞ of s (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Flamm et al., 2002</ref>) is the set of all points in X that can be reached from s by a path whose elevation never exceeds f(s). The saddle height Sðx, yÞ between any two vertices x and y is the minimal value h for which y 2 B h ðxÞ. In other words, Sðx, yÞ is the level at which two cycles B h ðxÞ and B h ðyÞ 'merge'. If x and y are LMs connected by a direct saddle point, then Sðx, yÞ DSðx, yÞ. A structure s 2 X is called a saddle between x, y 2 X if (i) fðsÞ ¼ Sðx, yÞ and (ii) there is a path P connecting x and y so that fðsÞ ! fðzÞ for all z 2 P. A path P Ã connecting x and y in the landscape is energetically optimal if max z2P Ã fðzÞ ¼ Sðx, yÞ. Energetically optimal paths are not necessarily unique (Supplementary Material Part C). For RNA folding landscapes, the problems of computing saddle heights, saddle points and the energetically optimal path are NP-hard (Manˇuch<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Manˇuch et al., 2011</ref>). It has been proven in (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Flamm et al., 2002</ref>) that for any two saddles s 0 and s 00 , Bðs 0 Þ Bðs 00 Þ, Bðs 00 Þ Bðs 0 Þ or Bðs 00 Þ \ Bðs 0 Þ ¼ ; is satisfied, i.e. the basins below saddles of a landscape form a hierarchy with respect to set inclusion order (Supplementary Material Part B). Because the landscape is connected, this hierarchical structure is naturally represented by a tree called barrier tree (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Flamm et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Wolfinger et al., 2004</ref>). The leaves and interior nodes of this tree correspond to the LMs and their saddle points, respectively. The barrier tree can be computed using a flooding algorithm (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Flamm et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Sibani et al., 1999</ref>) implemented, e.g. in the program barriers (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Flamm et al., 2002</ref>). It takes an energy sorted list of structures as input. This list may contain either all structures or only the structures below some threshold energy. The only part of barriers that relies on the geometric properties of the configuration space is the routine that generates all neighbors of each structure in the list. Therefore, barriers has a time complexity of OðÁ Â KÞ, where Á denotes the maximum number of neighbors for a structure in the landscape, and K denotes the number of structures in the input list. For the technical complications arising from degeneracy in the landscape, see<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Flamm et al. (2002)</ref>. The barrier tree abstraction has two major disadvantages: (i) It neglects much of the geometric information of the folding landscape because the neighborhood relation between basins is ignored as illustrated in<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. (ii) The high computational cost makes it unfeasible in practice for RNA molecules with a length 4100 nt.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">The Basin Hopping Graph</head><p>optimal transitions between neighbored basins ðA, BÞ, ðB, DÞ, ðA, CÞ and ðC, DÞ. On the other hand, a key observation is that the 'energetically optimal' transitions are usually rare and hence the BHG is a fairly sparse graph. Therefore, the BHG may be the minimal 'information container' that is able to track the energetically optimal paths between any two local minima in the RNA landscape. We have shown in<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>that the barrier tree fails to track the optimal path between A and D. In Supplementary Material Part C, we further prove inductively that the barrier tree is equivalent to the dendrogram obtained from the BHG by single linkage clustering. The BHG could be constructed by enumeration and flooding in a manner similar to the barrier tree. Instead, we describe an efficient heuristic that allows us to overcome the stringent length restrictions imposed by enumerative approaches. The procedure consists of two largely independent components: (i) The RNAlocmin program generates a sample set of LMs within a user-defined energy range above the MFE. This component replaces the exhaustive enumeration of all low energy states. (ii) The BHGbuilder algorithm is then used to estimate direct saddle points and to determine the BHG adjacency on the input set of LMs. As we show below, the vertex and edge weights can be estimated along the way.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">RNAlocmin</head><p>The basic idea of RNAlocmin is straightforward: it samples a start structure and then uses a gradient walk to determine the corresponding LM. The main technical difficulty is to make the sampling part efficient. Boltzmann sampling, as implemented in RNAsubopt-p or sfold (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ding and Lawrence, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ding et al., 2004</ref>), predominantly yields structures close to the MFE, which are frequently transported to the global minimum or one of the other local optima with low energy. To avoid this kind of oversampling, we resort to the idea underlying Simulated Annealing and modify the Boltzmann weights by an extra scaling factor that artificially increases the sample temperature:</p><formula>P ðsÞ ¼ e ÀfðsÞ RT =Q ð1Þ</formula><p>where Q the correspondingly modified partition function and serves as a normalization factor. A change of the thermodynamic temperature T also affects the RNA energy parameters, which are free energy contributions (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mathews et al., 1999</ref>), and hence affects f(s) in a biased manner. It is necessary, therefore, to be able to vary the thermodynamic temperature and the sample temperature independently. For ¼ 1 we obtain regular Boltzmann ensembles, for ! 1 we approach uniform sampling of X. The implementations of the partition function algorithms of the ViennaRNA Package have been modified to provide this option from version 2.0.3 on. Because we are interested in the LMs within a prescribed energy increment above the MFE, it pays to adjust accordingly. Instead of a fixed optimal , we use an adaptive-schedule, which prefers LMs with relatively low energies. As the thermodynamic energy model of RNAs is strongly dependent on the input sequence, we first estimate the expected energies as a function of. To this end, we obtain a set of LMs from 1000 sampled structures and tabulate the average energy of the LMs for each ¼ 0:4 þ k Â 0:1 in which an integer k ranges over the interval<ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr">21]</ref>,<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3</ref>(top). From these values we obtain an estimate eðÞ for the expected free energy by linear interpolation. In principle, one could precompute these tables for various sequence compositions. We found, however, that the computational overhead to estimate these values for each input is tolerable in practice. Alternatively, one could also estimate the eðÞ 'on the fly' from the already sampled LMs. From each sampled structure s, we obtain the corresponding LM x via a gradient walk starting from s. In practice, the implementation does not completely evaluate candidate structures but considers the energy increments for opening and closing individual base pairs, each of which can be obtained by three lookups from the tabulated energy model. For each LM x, the number q(x) of gradient walks terminating in x is recorded to keep track of sampling efficiency.<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Sahoo and Albrecht (2012)</ref>introduced a heuristic criterion designed to avoid reaching the same LM too many times from different initial random starting points. They propose that the sampling is sufficient when most of the minima have been seen at least twice. We modify this rule and stipulate that sampling is sufficient up to energy level e if '</p><formula>e 1 ( ' e 1 , where ' e k denotes</formula><p>the number of minima with an energy less than e that have been detected at least once and at most k times (' e k ¼ jfxj1 qðxÞ k; EðxÞ5egj). The rule of (<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Sahoo and Albrecht, 2012</ref>) and its energy-dependent variants are empirically well supported (see also Section 3) but so far lack a good theoretical justification. To turn the rule into an operational criterion, we determine, at a given step of the sample procedure, the smallest energy cutoff e</p><formula>so that ' e 1 ' e 1</formula><p>, where the so-called convergence parameter is a user-defined threshold, set to ¼ 0:1 by default. The energy e is then interpreted as the desired expected energy for the next sampling epoch. The corresponding value of is obtained from the precomputed table mentioned above. RNAlocmin continues until the energy e exceeds the user-defined upper bound or if the requested number of iterations have been done. The time complexity of RNAlocmin is composed of two parts. First, samples have to be gathered by RNAsubopt, and thengradient walks have to be constructed for each sample. The time complexity of an average gradient walk is Oðn 2 Þ, where n is the length of the sequence. We are dealing mainly with highly folded structures and they tend to only have small number of insertions possible, and therefore, these structures have O(n) neighbors. Recomputing their energy is in O(1) steps as mentioned earlier, and the gradient walk has at most O(n) steps on RNA landscapes. For each value of , we have a setup cost of Oðn 3 Þ for the forward recursion of McCaskill's algorithms and Oðn 2 Þ to generate a sample. The complexity of the latter step could be reduced to Oðn log nÞ using the Boustrophedon method (<ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ponty, 2008</ref>). As the sampling step is already dominated by the effort for the gradient walk, we retained the simpler implementation. The total time complexity is then OðI Á n 3 þ N Á n 2 Þ, where I is the number of-sampling epochs and N is the total number of sampled structures. For performance evaluation, we generated samples of 10 randomly generated RNA sequences with uniform nucleotide composition for each length from 60 to 500 (Supplementary Material Part D<ref type="figure">Fig. S2</ref>). For each sequence, LMs are generated from at most 10 5 start structures for each value of. Computations were performed on an Intel Xeon CPU E5450 3.00 GHz.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3">BHGbuilder</head><p>BHGbuilder aims to determine the BHG adjacency and the corresponding edge weights (saddle heights) between these adjacent LMs. Initially, all pairs of LMs are arranged in a priority queue L by increasing base pair distance. Then BHGbuilder uses an iterative procedure to determine the BHG-adjacent LMs: for each pair of LMs in L, (i) an initial path P ¼ ðx ¼ p 0 , p 1 ,. .. p 'þ1 ¼ yÞ is computed with some existing heuristic path-finding algorithm. Our implementation uses findpath (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Flamm et al., 2000</ref>) provided by the ViennaRNA Package as the default underlying algorithm (alternatives such as Pathfinder could be used as well); (ii) an iterative reevaluation procedure (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 4</ref>) is used to improve P. At each p i 2 P, we start a gradient walk and determine its end points v i. If all v i coincide with x or y, then fx, yg is a candidate BHG edge. Otherwise, each pair of distinct consecutive (w.r.t. to P) LMs is reinserted into the priority queue. The process ends when L is empty and returns an approximation of the BHG graph. Its vertex set consists of both the LMs provided as input (e.g. by RNAlocmin) and the additional LMs obtained in the path-construction step. Its edges are the BHG adjacencies as outlined above. Finally, a double-sided flooding procedure (optional) is called to further improve the edge weights between two BHG-adjacent vertices. Here, an exact saddle can be discovered by enumerating the structures in these two adjacent basins if the number of structures enumerated does not overcome a certain threshold. BHGbuilder has a time complexity of</p><formula>OðP Á M 2 þ E Á K Á nÞ,</formula><p>where terms capture the above described algorithm and the flooding of the resulting pairs of LMs: P is the time complexity of one run of the underlying path-finding algorithm, Oðn 2 Þ in the case of findpath; M is number of LMs in the input, E $ M denotes the number of edges in the BHG as an output; K denotes the maximal number of additional structures appearing in the flooding procedure and O(n) is the average time complexity to compute the neighborhood for each structure. Therefore, the time complexity of BHGbuilder with findpath is<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 5</ref>summarizes the sampling schedule and the size-weighted fraction of undetected basins as a function of invested CPU time. Not surprisingly, the sampling times to reach a given level of coverage of the landscape increase with sequence length. This is an obvious consequence of the exponential increase in the number of LMs. Nevertheless, the adaptive schedule is effective because for different RNA lengths, the speed of finding new LMs remains stable, i.e. the number of detected LMs grows linearly with respect to the running time (shown in the Supplementary Material Part D<ref type="figure">Fig. S2</ref>).<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 5</ref>(right)</p><formula>OðM 2 Á n 2 þ M Á K Á nÞ.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">RNAlocmin</head><p>shows that for sequence lengths up to 500 nt, RNAlocmin is able to find a collection of LMs whose combined basin sizes cover more than two-thirds of the search space within 200 s. For sequences shorter than 300 nt, this fraction increases to 80%. Similar results are obtained from biological RNA sequences and collected in Supplementary Material Part E Figures S3–S11. To compare the performance of RNAlocmin with RNAlocopt (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lorenz and Clote, 2011</ref>), we allocate the same CPU time to both programs and evaluate the total number of detected LMs and the size-weighted fraction of undiscovered<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 7</ref>, we compared the BHG (top) and the barrier tree (bottom) for the RNA molecule 5 0-GUGUCGCUUUCGAUUAAGGACCUAC AACAGGCU-3 0. To highlight the difference between the barrier tree and the BHG, we consider the refolding pathway between (i) the MFE and (ii) the next-lowest LM. Both structures readily allow us to read off the saddle height as 1.9 kcal/mol. The BHG shows that there are two alternative optimal pathways 1 ! 11 ! 5 ! 17 ! 9 ! 8 ! 2 and 1 ! 11 ! 5 ! 17 ! 9 ! 3 ! 2. The barrier tree provides a much more ambiguous picture. It suggests a refolding pathway climbing to the saddle separating LM 1 and LM 2 but does not provide any indication of the intermediate states. The path backtracking procedure implemented in barriers can identify the first folding pathway. Owing to the inherent tree topology, however, it is not possible to also find the alternative connection. We note here, this path backtracking procedure is limited to RNA molecules 100nt only, as the number of optimal paths is usually too big. There are pairs of LMs that are not connected by an energetically optimal path but are still BHG adjacent. An example is LM 1 and LM 5 in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 7</ref>, which are adjacent in the BHG while 1:6 ¼ Sð1, 5Þ5DSð1, 5Þ ¼ 3:2. These cases appear when the underlying path-searching algorithm misses the optimal solution for the initial path. In practice, these 'energetically suboptimal' paths rarely hurt the computation of the saddle height, which is calculated only after the entire BHG, and hence the competing indirect paths, have been determined. As these paths usually reduce the graph distance at the expense of a small energy penalty, such paths may still be relevant for the folding kinetics. One might want to consider an optimization criterion that involves both path length and energy instead of just peak energy along the path as we do here.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Approximation of saddle heights</head><p>BHGbuilder is a heuristic algorithm and thus will in general only find upper bounds of saddle heights. For moderate-size RNAs, a direct comparison with exact values obtained from barriers is possible. For larger molecules, we compare with other heuristics. In particular, it is interesting to check whether the construction of the BHG brings a further improvement of the saddle heights compared with the path construction heuristic findpath alone. Because BHGbuilder uses findpath for its initial estimates of saddle heights, it is of course guaranteed that S barriers ðx, yÞ S BHGbuilder ðx, yÞ S findpath ðx, yÞ. The improvements of BHGbuilder over findpath are mostly a consequence of the inclusion of additional LMs such as (17) in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 7</ref>(top), which is necessary for the optimal path. In<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 8</ref>, we use two snRNAs as examples, the 107 nt U6 snRNA of Melitaea cinxia and the 166 nt U1 snRNA of the mouse. For U6, we sample 1000 LMs and determine the exact saddle heights between all pairs by flooding with RNAsubopt/barriers. The saddle point estimates are similar in this case, with BHGbuilder obtaining theexact values and only small errors of up to 0.1 kcal/mol in $7.4% of the pairs for findpath. For the 166 nt mouse U1 snRNA, however, an exact computation with barriers already exceeds our hardware limitations. The direct comparison of BHGbuilder and findpath yields a moderate improvement of on average 0.8 kcal/mol for almost half of the pairs of LMs. BHGbuilder performs equally well or better than findpath in all 10 examples of Supplementary Material Part F Figures S12–S21. For three cases, we find substantial improvements of the saddle point energies that can help to derive more exact RNA kinetic parameters. In seven cases, only small or no improvements were obtained. Still, the adjacency information generated by BHGbuilder, can add further accuracy to kinetic parameters in all cases because it provides information on alternative connections between LMs; see Supplementary Material Part F for details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Prediction of folding pathways</head><p>BHGbuilder can also be used to predict the optimal folding path between a pair of userprescribed LMs. Here we make use of the iterative path improvement step to elaborate on underlying folding path prediction software such as findpath (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Flamm et al., 2000</ref>), RNAtabupath (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dotu et al., 2010</ref>) and Pathfinder (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lorenz et al., 2009</ref>). In<ref type="figure">Table 1</ref>, we compare BHGbuilder with findpath, RNAtabupath and Pathfinder on 100 randomly generated instances with n ¼ 200, i.e. well beyond the reach of exact enumeration. Interestingly, the computationally expensive flooding step brings no improvement for this task. Pathfinder nearly always obtains the path with the lowest peak height but is more than two orders of magnitude slower.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.4">SV11 RNA: a hard case</head><p>The SV11 sequence is a particularly hard test case for landscape-oriented algorithms because it features a functional metastable state with high energy and a high energy barrier. The 115 nt SV11 RNA was discovered in in vitro selection experiments as an excellent substrate for Q replicase (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Biebricher and Luce, 1992</ref>). It features a nearly palindromic sequence with an extremely stable hairpin-like MFE structure. Pulse-chase experiments showed that the active conformation is a metastable structure formed during replication, while the MFE serves as a template for the Q replicase. Melting experiments indicated that the metastable conformation comprises two distinct stems (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Biebricher and Luce, 1992</ref>). The energy difference between the MFE and the metastable conformation is 28.5 kcal/mol, well beyond the reach of exhaustive enumeration. Boltzmann sampling is also inefficient for such large energy differences as well, hence RNAlocopt is still trapped in the vicinity of the MFE after 1 h at a sample size of 10 8. During the same wall clock time, RNAlocmin (convergence parameter ¼ 0:8) found the metastable in a sample of 4 Â 10 6 structures.<ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>. Energy landscape of the SV11 RNA.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 9A and B summarize the differences between</head><p>RNAlocopt and RNAlocmin in the base pair distance distributions of the LMs. While RNAlocopt found only 620 distinct LMs, we obtained 2 619 305 with RNAlocmin using a much smaller sample size. Importantly, RNAlocmin covers not only LMs near to MFE but also, due to the adaptive schedule, those more distant LMs in energy and base pairing pattern. RNAlocmin found the metastable stable state as the 365172th LM w.r.t. energy. BHGbuilder cannot process an input set of this size within reasonable time. Most of the LMs, however, are not persistent. They are either shallow or just 'transition' LMs with only two neighbors in the final BHG. Therefore, we selected from the initial input set those that remains LM with respect to an expanded move set that includes base pair shifts (<ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Wuchty et al., 1999</ref>). Now the metastable has rank $6700 w.r.t. energy. Starting from the 7000 lowest LMs w.r.t. to the expanded move set and removing shallow LMs whose gradient basin has an escape barrier 51.0 kcal/mol leaves an initial set of 2665 nonshallow LMs as input. BHGbuilder constructs a BHG with 110593 vertices and 224666 edges in 520 h. The optimal folding path connecting MFE to metastable state in the BHG has a saddle height of À59:2kcal=mol. This is a 3.1 kcal/mol improvement over both findpath and Pathfinder. We visualized the optimal path by monitoring how the free energies and the base pair distances (with MFE) vary along this path in<ref type="figure">Figure 9C</ref>and D, respectively. With few exceptions, the base pair distance monotonically decreases along the pathway. Interestingly, most of these detours appear in close vicinity of high energy peaks, which is potentially necessary to circle around the high energy barriers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">CONCLUDING REMARKS</head><p>The BHG introduced here is a conceptually rigorous coarse graining of a landscape comprising the LMs and those direct saddle points between them that are also globally the most favorable connections. At the same time it is a refinement of the barrier tree, which can be obtained from the BHG by single linkage clustering. It is not specific to RNA folding, which we used as a concrete application here, but can be computed in principle for any landscape. The focus on the BHG adjacency captures the most likely transitions between basins. Thus, when the BHG serves as a basis for computing folding dynamics, one-step transition rate P x, y between any two given local minima x and y is approximated by an Arrhenius rule as P x, y / e ÀSðx, yÞ=RT if x and y are adjacent in the BHG and 0 otherwise. This improves on the Arrhenius approximation for the barrier tree in which P x, y / e ÀSðx, yÞ=RT for each pair of local minima. Using<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>as an example, in the BHG, any pathway from A to D needs to pass through either B or C, and thus, it requires two steps to refold from A to D. However, in a barrier tree, this is approximated as a one-step transition because it omits the geometric information between two basins. This approximation will be less accurate than the macro-state transition rates model outlined by<ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Wolfinger et al. (2004)</ref>. For instance, the direct transition between A and D in<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>is neglected in the BHG model. A toy kinetic example comparing the three discussed approaches is presented in Supplementary Material Part G. The exponential relation between energies and rates suggests that energetically non-optimal direct transitions will play only a minor role compared with pathways with multiple intermediates that all have strictly smaller peak energies. This is true only for differences larger than a few kT. To accommodate this point, we can replace energetic optimality by a relaxed condition of the form DSðx, yÞ À Sðx, yÞ ÁE ef , which includes some suboptimal direct transitions between basins to the BHG. It will be interesting to see how the threshold ÁE ef affects the folding kinetics. It is computationally feasible to keep suboptimal transitions as long as ÁE ef is a small multiple of kT. The BHG has been introduced with the explicit purpose of allowing for an efficient high-quality heuristic approximation so as to overcome the stringent size limitations of the exact algorithms. Empirically we find that the combination of improved sampling of low-energy local LMs with RNAlocmin, fast construction of initial candidate saddles with findpath and the construction of the BHG by iterative path improvement with BHGbuilder comes close to the exact solutions for small systems. At the same time, it extends the range at which RNA folding landscapes can be studied to at least 300 nt, thus including most structured RNAs of biological interest, such as RNAs shown in Supplementary Material Part E and F. BHGbuilder is also capable of exploring partial landscapes determined by the input set of LMs. Therefore, it allows us to 'zoom-in' and focus on the region of particular biological interest. The methods are readily extended to pseudoknotted RNAs as shown in Supplementary Material Part H. However, they become computationally much more demanding.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig.3.</head><figDesc>Fig. 3.

			<note place="foot" n="2">.3.1 Definition The BHG has been devised to overcome these shortcomings. The basic idea is to incorporate additional neighborhood information by considering LMs as adjacent if the transition between their corresponding basins is &apos;energetically optimal&apos;. For two given LMs x and y, the condition energetically optimal requires that their direct saddle height is equal to their saddle height, i.e. DSðx, yÞ ¼ Sðx, yÞ. A schematic diagram of the BHG for a toy landscape is illustrated in Figure 2, in which, the transition from A to B on Figure 2 is energetically optimal, as SðA, BÞ ¼ DSðA, BÞ ¼ 0, but the transition from A to D is not, as 0:5 ¼ DSðA, DÞ4SðA, DÞ ¼ 0. We focus on the energetically optimal transitions because, on one hand as proven in Supplementary Material Lemma S1, the energetically optimal paths connecting two local minima x and y can be represented as a concatenation of energetically optimal transitions between neighboring basins. In Figure 2, for example, there are two energetically optimal paths between A and D: A ! B ! D and A ! C ! D. Both paths are composed of Fig. 2. A landscape with four local minima (A, B, C, and D) is illustrated in the left hand side. Its corresponding barrier tree (top) and BHG (bottom) are shown on the right hand side with saddle heights annotated inside. For any pair of local minima, their corresponding saddle heights are all equal to 0 kcal/mol. Regarding direct saddle heights, except DSðA, DÞ ¼ DSðB, CÞ ¼ 0:5kcal=mol, the rest are all of value 0 kcal/mol. One key difference is that the energetically favorable neighborhood relation between the basins can be displayed in the BHG but not in the barrier tree</note>

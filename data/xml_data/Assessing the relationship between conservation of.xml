				<p>Motivation: Assessing the false positive rate of function prediction methods is difficult, as it is hard to establish that a protein does not have a certain function. To determine to what extent proteins with similar sequences have a common function, we focused on photosynthesis-related proteins. A protein that comes from a non-photosynthetic organism is, undoubtedly, not involved in photosynthesis. Results: We show that function diverges very rapidly: 70% of the close homologs of photosynthetic proteins come from non-photosynthetic organisms. Therefore, high sequence similarity, in most cases, is not tantamount to similar function. However, we found that many functionally similar proteins often share short sequence elements, which may correspond to a functional site and could reveal functional similarities more accurately than sequence similarity. Conclusions: These results shed light on the way biological function is conserved in evolution and may help improve large-scale analysis of protein function.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Homology is believed to allow large-scale functional annotation. Since the 19th century, similarity between biological entities is defined as homology, in case that they evolved from a common ancestor, and as analogy, in case that they share a common function (<ref type="bibr">Owen and Cooper, 1843</ref>). Later definitions made these terms mutually exclusive by defining analogy as convergence from two different ancestors (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Fitch, 2000</ref>). Historically, these terms were introduced by naturalists and were based on anatomy and morphology. On the molecular level, however, they are used more loosely (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Fitch, 2000</ref>), and homology is often used interchangeably with sequence similarity and is commonly believed to reflect similar function (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Harrington et al., 2007</ref>). Thus, although the vast majority of known proteins were never experimentally characterized, or even observed as RNA transcripts (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Boeckmann et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Consortium, 2009</ref>), many of them have functional annotations that are based on sequence similarity to experimentally annotated proteins. These predicted functions are often used to perform functional comparisons between genomes and to analyse metagenomic data (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Harrington et al., 2007</ref>). One such analysis reported that by using BLAST, they were able to assign a function reliably to 70% of the gene products in new genomes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Harrington et al., 2007</ref>). Despite the wide use of this approach, the performance of homologybased methods for function prediction was rarely assessed systematically. Assessment of function prediction is sometimes considered 'not possible'. Assumptions regarding the relationship between sequence homology and functional analogy are difficult to assess. Many, if not most, of the proteins are multi-functional (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Freitas et al., 2009</ref>), making existing annotations partial. Therefore, when a predicted function does not correspond to an experimentally verified function of a protein, it is hard to determine whether it is a false prediction or a true prediction of a yet-unobserved function of that protein. Several collaborations and community-wide efforts have attempted to establish standards for assessment of computational annotation of protein function (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Blaschke et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Friedberg et al., 2006</ref>). The genome annotation assessment project (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Reese et al., 2000</ref>), an early attempt at quality assessment of genome-wide annotation, concluded that 'function predictions are the most difficult annotations to produce and to evaluate' and that owing to the incompleteness of existing annotation, 'a consistent and correct assessment of function predictions. .. was not possible'. CASP, which was originally designed to assess structure prediction methods, has widened its scope to assess also the function predictions (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lopez et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Soro and Tramontano, 2005</ref>). The assessors concluded, however, that except for the identification of ligand-binding residues, which is in essence structural, they could not find a procedure that allows quantitative assessment of performance (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lopez et al., 2007</ref>). AFP/CAFA, another community-wide effort to establish a framework for assessing function prediction, was held five times since 2005 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Friedberg et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rodrigues et al., 2007</ref>). The organizers based their experiments on proteins whose functions were experimentally determined but not yet published. Assessment is based on measuring the distance between predicted and experimental annotations on the Gene Ontology (GO) graph. The benchmark sets that were established using this approach are small and do not allow for statistically significant assessment. The lack of clear definition of function is also a major drawback in assessing function prediction. Studies that have assessed sequence similarity as a means for determining functional similarity gave contradicting results. Some concluded that sequence identity 580% (<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Rost, 2002)</ref>*To whom correspondence should be addressed. ß The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com or, by other accounts, 60% (<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Tian and Skolnick, 2003</ref>) do not allow for reliable functional inference. Similarly, several studies have warned against blindly trusting homology as a proxy for functional identity (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gerlt and Babbitt, 2000</ref>). Studies that explored the potential for errors in genomic scale computational annotations (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bork and Koonin, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Brenner, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Devos and Valencia, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Schnoes et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Tatusov et al., 2003</ref>) reported error rates of between 5% and 460%. Motifs and patterns identify similarity that is not based on homology. Another widely used tool for function assignment is sequence motifs, domains and patterns using tools such as Prosite (<ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Sigrist et al., 2002</ref>), Interpro (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mulder and Apweiler, 2002</ref>), Pfam (<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Sonnhammer et al., 1997</ref>), MEX (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kunik et al., 2007</ref>) or MEME (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bailey et al., 2009</ref>). These tools typically provide a statistical measure for the significance of the specific motif, similar to BLAST's E-value. For instance, MEME's E-value, which is based on log likelihood ratio, width, sites, the background letter frequencies and the size of the training set, is an estimate of the expected number of motifs with the given log likelihood ratio (or higher), and with the same width and site count, that one would find in a similarly sized set of random sequences. Typically, these tools do not search for homology. Rather, they assume that common sequence motifs, which may reveal very distant homology or may be convergent analogy, constitute functional determinants, biologically important residues, binding sites or active sites in the protein (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aitken, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kunik et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Sigrist et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Wade, 2002</ref>). The precision and recall of Pfam as a means for function prediction was assessed in one study together with that of PSI-BLAST (<ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Wass and Sternberg, 2008</ref>) as a benchmark for a GO-based function prediction method. Several other studies analysed the relationship between sequence similarity, domain conservation and function prediction (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Heger et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Portugaly et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Schug et al., 2002</ref>). Some of them concluded that tools such as ProDom could reach accuracy of 87% in their functional assignments (<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Schug et al., 2002</ref>). Function prediction of ORFans is particularly difficult. Many, possibly most, known protein sequences come from metagenomic projects that produce sequences of unidentified species, and include substantial numbers of ORFans, novel protein families and remote homologs to known proteins (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ellrott et al., 2010</ref>). It has been suggested that metagenomic data can shed new light on many biological processes, including photosynthesis (PS) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Yutin and Beja, 2005</ref>), as many marine organisms are believed to be photosynthetic (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cuvelier et al., 2010</ref>), and their divergence from known terrestrial photosynthetic organisms may be large. Indeed, metagenomic data have led to the identification of novel proteins that provide insights into PS (<ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Yutin and Beja, 2005</ref>). Identifying novel families of photosynthetic proteins that are not obvious homologs of known PS proteins is a non-trivial task. However, when it comes to ORFans, the lack of homologs precludes the use of homology-based methods altogether. PS provides a way to assess function prediction. We focus our analysis on PS-related functions not only for the importance of identifying novel photosynthetic proteins but also because they provide a way to assess functional assignments. An assignment of photosynthetic annotation to a protein that comes from an organism that is not photosynthetic is, without doubt, an error. Thus, it is possible to unequivocally identify false assignments and assess the possibility of finding novel photosynthetic families and remote homologs to known PS-related proteins. We used GO to compile a list of functions that are unique to PS (i.e. GO terms that describe functions, which are essential to PS but are also part of other biological processes, were not included in the analysis, see Section 2). We also created a non-redundant set of proteins that were experimentally verified to be involved in PS. Finally, we identified all Pfam domains that are related to PS. These lists of proteins, GO terms and Pfam domains allowed us to assess function assignments by Pfam, BLAST and PSI-BLAST. In addition, using MEME, we generated a list of short motifs (6–9 characters) for the experimentally verified PS proteins and used these motifs to predict the functions of new proteins. We thus explore conservation of function by assessing the performance of widely used methods that rely on completely different biological rationales.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.8">Assessing motifs</head><p>To assess the precision of the predictions, we checked whether a predicted PS protein comes from a species that belongs to taxonomy ranks that perform PS. The taxonomy ranks are listed in Supplementary Table S3. This was done to get the most optimistic assessment of the prediction. All other proteins with traceable source (e.g. proteins from vertebrates) were marked as false positives. Precision, which measures what fraction of the proteins that are predicted to be PS related are, indeed, PS related, is defined as:</p><p>precision ¼ tp tp þ fp ð1Þ where tp is the number of true positive predictions, namely the number of proteins predicted to be photosynthetic that originated from a photosynthetic organisms, and fp is the number of proteins predicted as photosynthetic that originated from a non-photosynthetic organism. Precision is typically complemented by another measure, recall, defined as:</p><formula>recall ¼ tp tp þ fn ð2Þ</formula><p>where fn is the number of false negative predictions. Recall assesses how well the method identifies the desired instances in the dataset. It is impossible to get an exact assessment of the recall in this case, as there is no benchmark set that includes all proteins that are involved in PS. As a proxy for recall, we recorded the number of hits, namely the number of proteins predicted by each method to be PS related. Combined with the precision, this measure provides an assessment of the performance of a prediction method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.9">Assessing sequence similarity as a prediction method</head><p>We performed BLAST and PSI-BLAST searches against the UniProtKB using our initial dataset of 1256 experimentally annotated PS proteins as queries. From the initial dataset, we looked for all BLAST results with 0 E-value 1. PSI-BLAST parameters were as follows: Database used—UniProtKB; Number of iterations—3; PSI-BLAST Threshold for next iteration—0.001. In the end of the third iteration, we used all proteins with E-value 0 E-value 1 as our dataset.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Photosynthetic-related proteins</head><p>Of 15 082 690 entries in UniProtKB, we extracted 184 991 with PS-related GO annotations. Of these, only 1425 proteins have GO evidence codes that are based on experiments. Clustering these proteins with CD-HIT (<ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Yang et al., 2010</ref>) yielded 1256 sequence-unique experimentally annotated proteins. We used these proteins to identify new putative photosynthetic proteins based on sequence similarity, using BLAST and PSI-BLAST. It has been shown that using HSSP (<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Schneider et al., 1997</ref>) to rescore homology based also on the length of the alignment and not only on the sequence similarity can improve homology-based predictions (<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Rost, 2002</ref>). Therefore, we also assessed the performance of HSSP scores. We also extracted short sequence motifs from the initial set of sequence unique experimentally annotated proteins and used them to annotate other proteins as putatively PS related. In addition, we found in Pfam all the domains that are marked in Pfam as related to functions that are exclusively photosynthetic and used these domains to identify other proteins that are putatively PS related. Finally, we used the InterPro mapping of Pfam to GO terms (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lopez et al., 2007</ref>), which is a manual assignment of Pfam domains to specific functions in a similar manner to predict function of new proteins.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Short sequence motifs</head><p>Four hundred short sequence motifs were extracted by MEME from our non-redundant dataset of 1256 experimentally annotated PS proteins. The motifs are listed in Supplementary Tables S6, S7, S8 and S9. After filtering (see Section 2), we were left with 390 motifs that were used in two separated sets: MEME6..9, comprising all the motifs, and MEME7..9 (293 motifs), comprising only the longer motifs of length 7, 8 or 9.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>shows the precision and the number of hits for all the approaches. A functional assignment was defined as false if the query protein comes from a genus that is not known to include any photosynthetic species (see Section 2). Thus, the real precision is probably lower, as this assessment disregards false function assignments for proteins within photosynthetic genera. Proteins in photosynthetic organisms constitute close to 15% of UniProtKB proteins, and therefore random assignment of function is expected to have precision of around 0.15. All methods have precision that is substantially higher than random. BLAST, PSI-BLAST and Pfam are within a similar range (between 0.27 for PSI-BLAST and Pfam and 0.29 for BLAST). The two sets of MEME yield different results: MEME6..9 reaches precision of 0.3, similar to the other methods, whereas functional assignments that are based on the longer motifs of MEME7..9 reach substantially more accurate precision of 0.43. The variability in the number of hits was greater than that of the precision, with PSI-BLAST (against UniProtKB, see Section 2) identifying almost 10 hits for every hit of Pfam and 430 hits for every hit of MEME. Interestingly, the manually curated domains of Pfam-GO yielded exceptional precision of 0.74; however, the hits were meager. The reported results are after redundancy reduction with CD-HIT (<ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Yang et al., 2010</ref>) (see Section 2). These results are, by and large, consistent with the known trade-off between precision and recall, by which more accurate methods have lower discovery rates. The extreme case is that of the manually curated set of Pfam-GO. It is clear that these carefully selected domains are very tightly associated with PS. However, these domains can hardly identify any new proteins. We found that virtually all the proteins that are identified by Pfam-GO could be identified by BLAST or PSI-BLAST (data not shown). To assess how well each of these approaches identifies novel families, we checked the overlap between the non-redundant set of Pfam and all the other redundant sets, and the non-redundant set of MEME 6..9 and all the other redundant sets. The reason we performed the comparison this way is that we wish to determine how many of the unique sequences identified by Pfam and MEME, respectively, overlap with any protein identified by the other methods. HSSP, by definition, is contained within BLAST results; hence, its potential advantage is only in identifying better hits within BLAST hits, and not in identifying novel families. Similarly, BLAST hits are almost contained within PSI–BLAST hits (depending on PSI–BLAST<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>shows the results of this comparison. In all, 74% and 46% of the unique sequences identified by Pfam and MEME, respectively, are not detected by any of the other methods. A possible way to further improve the precision of sequence motifs or domains is by trusting only proteins in which multiple motifs occur. Using MEME6..9 and MEME7..9, we found 805 different combinations of short motifs that occur in 5652 proteins, and 460 different combinations of short motifs that occur in 3922 proteins, respectively. Using Pfam and Pfam-GO, we found 22 different combinations of Pfam domains that occur in 403 proteins, and nine different combinations of Pfam domains that occur in 164 proteins, respectively. As shown in<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>, this increased the precision of MEME6..9 and MEME7..9 to 0.55 and 0.6, respectively, and the precision of Pfam to 0.45. Clearly, this comes on the account of the number of hits. The manual set of domains identified by Pfam-GO reaches precision of 0.98, but the number of hits drops to 164 proteins—an order of magnitude below the size of the initial set of experimentally annotated proteins, which suggests that in this setting Pfam-GO is unable to find novel PS-related proteins. The number of hits for Pfam was also low (403). This is not surprising, given that Pfam motifs, by design, tend to be much longer than MEME motifs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Smaller E-value does not always imply more similar function</head><p>Several studies have searched for a level of sequence similarity that can assure identical function (<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Rost, 2002</ref>). To test whether closer homologs are less functionally divergent, we checked the precision and number of hits for different ranges of E-values. As shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref>, the effect of increasing E-value on precision is hardly noticeable for most E-values. There is a significant increase in precision only for very small E-values. Thus, at least for PS proteins, it seems that more significant E-values may not increase precision in most cases. The precision of the un-binned sets (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>) is slightly lower than the precision of the binned data. This effect is due to the redundancy in the un-binned sets. A protein may be homologous to several proteins from our initial set and thus appear in several bins, each time different E-values. This is more likely to happen to a real photosynthetic protein (i.e. a PS protein is more likely than a non-PS protein to be similar to several PS proteins). When we group all the BLAST results together without binning different E-values. This protein will appear only once. When we bin them according to their E-value, it may appear in several different bins. Therefore, redundancy reduction of hits for the binned sets, which was done for each bin separately, has a slightly higher chance of retaining positive examples than redundancy reduction for the entire set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Errors in short motifs-based functional annotation of PS proteins</head><p>homology and remote homology based on sequence similarity. Although there are more direct ways to assess homology (e.g. through phylogentic analysis), these methods gained their popularity, among other reasons, because of the implicit assumption that they are quick to identify functionally related sequences. Our results, however, show that these expectations may not be correct, particularly when it comes to the annotation of metagenomic data. Despite the sophistication of Pfam, its precision is not better than that of the universally applicable PSI-BLAST, BLAST or automatically detected short motifs, and it finds much less proteins than BALST or PSI-BLAST. However, most of the protein families Pfam identifies could not be detected by the other methods. BLAST itself provides at least 70% false functional assignments, which improves only for extremely high E-vlaues (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref>). Our results indicate that using the manually curated motifs of Pfam-GO leads to the most reliable predictions of function. However, the extremely low number of hits indicates that this approach hardly finds novel proteins and identifies mostly the proteins that were used to extract the motifs. Short motifs identified by MEME, which may be poor indicators of homology can reflect function more accurately than homologybased methods. However, this comes at the cost of lower number of hits. As shown in<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, our results reflect the complementarity of the different approaches: BLAST, Pfam and short motifs identify novel proteins that could not be detected by the other methods. Of the true positives of MEME7..9, 20% are not discovered by any other method. Of the PFAM true positives, 76% are not discovered by any other method. It is possible to improve precision on the account of recall for short motifs by requiring more than one motif in each protein. It is possible to achieve similar improvement by increasing BLAST E-value. Thus, at least when it comes to the ability to discover new PS proteins in metagenomic data, the combination of short motif-based approaches with homology-based ones seems a promising path. It is not clear whether sharing a common sequence motif (or a combination thereof) is more likely to be the result of remote homology or the result of convergence. This question has farreaching implications for the understanding of the evolution of function. Addressing it may require the development of new tools for the analysis of function and a thorough review of the phylogeny of each sequence. We can speculate that some<ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>.

Trusting only the functional assignments that are based on at least two motifs (or domains) of MEME (or Pfam) in each protein resulted in better overall precision at the cost of fewer hits. The manually curated domains of Pfam-GO reach striking precision of 0.98; however, they hardly discovered any proteins, and MEME7..9 reached precision of 0.6 with 3922 hits. The yellow and red bars represent the results for the manually curated motifs in Pfam-GO functions are more likely than others to be predictable-based sequence motifs. For example, in the GO classifications, molecular function may be more predicable from motifs than biological processes. However, for each function this should be assessed separately.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>Photosynthetic proteins provide an opportunity to assess the false positive rate of function prediction methods. At least for photosynthetic proteins, false positive rate of methods that are based on overall sequence similarity is 70%. Short motifs-based approaches have false positive rate of 57%, but this improved precision comes with lower discovery rate. Beyond the evolutionary insights that may be drawn from these findings, they indicate that combining these approaches will improve large-scale function predictionsimilarity, we checked the precision and recall (after redundancy reduction) of different intervals of BLAST E-values, using all 1256 experimentally annotated PS-related proteins in our set as queries</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig.1.</head><figDesc>Fig. 1.

			<note place="foot" n="2">.1.2 Parsing UniProtKB We parsed all entries in UniProtKB and searched the DR section for Pfam domains. Parsing was done in Python. 2.1.3 PS at GO From all GO ontologies, we extracted all child terms of PS and their child terms, recursively. From this list, we removed terms that are also children of terms that do not belong to the list. That is, terms that descend from PS but also from other functions that are not PS or its descendants, were removed. The remaining terms were defined as unique to PS. We found 184 991 proteins with these terms. Many of these proteins have PS-relevant annotation in more than one of the ontologies (Hill et al., 2008). We excluded from the analysis all annotations that were based on predictions. The evidence codes we used are therefore: EXP, IDA, IPI, IMP, IGI, IEP, TAS and NAS. We were left with 1425 proteins. Supplementary Table S1 lists these proteins. The GO numbers that were used are listed in Supplementary Table S2. The distribution of the different codes we found is presented in Supplementary Table S11. 2.2 Redundancy reduction We removed redundancy from the set of experimentally annotated photosynthetic proteins and from the predicted sequences using CD-HIT (Yang et al., 2010), which clusters all proteins by similarity over length parameters (at least 50% similarity on 90% of protein&apos;s length in our case). From each such cluster, we retained a single representative. In the case of the set of experimentally annotated photosynthetic proteins, this resulted in 1256 unique proteins. The CD-HIT redundancy reduction was done with the following command: cd-hit-i51425 fasta sequences4-o5output file4-aL 0.9-c 0.5-n 3-T 0 Using different cut-offs for similarity (e.g. aL 0.75 –c 0.8) did not change the overall trends (data not shown).</note>

			<note place="foot">Reviewing the false positive predictions, namely proteins that were wrongly identified as PS related, revealed some common errors. Although some proteins, such as Q27472_CAEEL (found by PSI-BLAST) from Caenorhabditis elegans or Q0PWT1_DIACI (found by Pfam) from Asian citrus psyllid (an insect), come from organisms that are undoubtedly not photosynthetic, other cases are more subtle. Some of these annotations can be explained by similarity of functions: proteins, which are involved in the electron transport chain, ATP transformers or ubiquinon related functions, which are part of the PS process, may be homologous to proteins in similar processes in non-photosynthetic organisms and thus might be mistakenly associated with PS. Some proteins may have an ancestral source among PS organisms. Although they evolved to different functions, the motif may have remained intact. A4IE64_LEIIN is an example for a protein that includes several strongly predictive PS-related motifs, but belongs to Leishmania infantum (a non-photosynthetic eukaryote). Previous studies have shown that trypanosomatid parasites, including Leishmania, possessed a plastid at some point in their evolutionary history, and that their extant genomes contain &apos;plant-like&apos; genes encoding homologs of proteins found in either chloroplasts or in the cytosol of plants and algae (Hannaert et al., 2003; Weber and Fischer, 2007). Another source of false positive is marine viruses. Q6H943_9CAUD is one of many proteins that were predicted by Pfam to be PS2 complex proteins but come from viral genomes. A recent study (Sharon et al., 2009) revealed the presence of PS proteins in marine viruses. Obviously, false positive may arise also from short motifs that randomly occur in some sequences. 3.6 Homology should not be automatically considered a proxy for functional similarity BLAST, PSI-BLAST, Pfam and short motifs generated by MEME represent different approaches for the detection of Fig. 2. Overlap between the novel proteins identified by each method. Although HSSP, BLAST and PSI-BLAST overlap very significantly by definition, to assess the unique protein families identified by MEME and Pfam, we compared the non-redundant (nr) set of hits for each of them to the full set of the other methods. The numbers in parentheses next to the circles are the number of hits for each method. The numbers inside the circles (with percentage in parentheses) are the numbers of proteins that were not identified by other methods. For example, the non-redundant set of proteins identified by Pfam as photosynthetic included 33 183 proteins. In all, 24 644 of these proteins, or 74% of them, were not identified by BLAST or PSI-BLAST. The overlap between the unique hits of MEME and Pfam was very low (only 392 proteins)</note>

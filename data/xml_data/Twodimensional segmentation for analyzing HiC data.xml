				<p>Motivation: The spatial conformation of the chromosome has a deep influence on gene regulation and expression. Hi-C technology allows the evaluation of the spatial proximity between any pair of loci along the genome. It results in a data matrix where blocks corresponding to (self-)interacting regions appear. The delimitation of such blocks is critical to better understand the spatial organization of the chromatin. From a computational point of view, it results in a 2D segmentation problem. Results: We focus on the detection of cis-interacting regions, which appear to be prominent in observed data. We define a block-wise segmentation model for the detection of such regions. We prove that the maximization of the likelihood with respect to the block boundaries can be rephrased in terms of a 1D segmentation problem, for which the standard dynamic programming applies. The performance of the proposed methods is assessed by a simulation study on both synthetic and resampled data.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Many key steps of the cell development and cycle, such as DNA replication and gene expression are influenced by the 3D structure of the chromatin (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Dixon et al., 2012</ref>). The folding of the chromosome in the space defines chromosomal territories, the function of which has been studied for few years now (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</ref>). Typically, topologically associating domains contain clusters of genes that are co-regulated (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Nora et al., 2012</ref>). Thus, the detection of chromosomal regions having close spatial location in the nucleus will provide insights for a better understanding of the influence of the chromosomal conformation on the cells functioning. Several chromosome conformation capture technologies have been developed in the past decade, among which Hi-C is the most recent. This technology is based on a deep sequencing approach and provides read pairs corresponding to pairs of genomic loci that physically interact in the nucleus (<ref type="bibr">LiebermanAiden et al., 2009</ref>). The raw measurement provided by Hi-C is therefore a list of pairs of locations along the chromosome, at the nucleotide resolution. These measurement are often summarized as a square matrix Y, where Y i,j stands for the total number of read pairs matching in position i and position j, respectively. Positions refer here to a sequence of non-overlapping windows of equal sizes covering the genome. The number n of windows may vary from one study to another: Lieberman<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Aiden et al. (2009)</ref>considered an Mb resolution, whereas<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Dixon et al. (2012)</ref>went deeper and used windows of 100 kb. Blocks of higher intensity arise among this matrix, revealing both cis-and trans-interacting regions (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Fraser et al., 2009</ref>). Although both types of interaction are likely to exist, cis-interacting regions seem to be prominent in the data (see<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Dixon et al., 2012, and</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figs 7 and 8</ref>, for instance), and some have been confirmed to host co-regulated genes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Nora et al., 2012</ref>). Such regions result in block of higher signal along the diagonal of the data matrix. The purpose of the statistical analysis is then to provide a fully automated and efficient strategy to determine these regions. A first attempt was presented in<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Dixon et al. (2012)</ref>, where the author strategy is first to summarize the 2D data into a 1D index, called the directionality index, then to apply a regular hidden Markov model to the summary data to retrieve the segmentation. In this article, we show that such a two-step strategy can be avoided, and that summarizing the data is not required to solve the segmentation problem. Detecting diagonal blocks can be seen as a particular 2D segmentation issue. The 2D segmentation has been widely investigated for the detection of contour with arbitrary shape in images (see, for example,<ref type="bibr">Darbon and Sigelle, 2006a, b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hochbaum, 2001</ref>). From a computational point of view, image segmentation is an open problem because no predefined ordering exists that could be used to provide exact and efficient algorithms. Compared with contour detection, it is worth noticing that Hi-C data segmentation displays a specific pattern that did not receive any special attention from the image processing community. One of our contributions is to prove that this 2D segmentation problem boils down to a 1D segmentation problem for which efficient dynamic programming algorithms apply (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bellman, 1961;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Lavielle, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Picard et al., 2005</ref>). Our formulation of the problem also allows us to solve some nonblock diagonal segmentation problems (see the end of Section 2.2). The article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we define a general statistical model for Hi-C data, which can deal with both raw and normalized data. We prove that the maximum likelihood estimates of the block boundaries can be efficiently retrieved. In Section 3, we first present an extensive simulation study to assess the performance of our approach on both simulated and resampled data. We then apply the proposed methodology to the data studied by<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Dixon et al. (2012)</ref>, which are publicly available, and compare our results with their regions. The package implementing the proposed method is presented in Section 4 where some open problems are also discussed. *To whom correspondence should be addressed. ß The Author 2014.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Statistical modeling</head><p>We first define our statistical model. Because the Hi-C data matrix is symmetric, we only consider its upper triangular part denoted by Y, in which Y i;j ð1 i j nÞ stands for the intensity of the interaction between positions i and j.

An example of such a matrix is displayed in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>(left). Namely, we define the (half) diagonal blocks</p><formula>D * k ðk=1;. ..

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Application to synthetic data</head><p>We conducted several Monte Carlo simulations first on synthetic data and then on resampled real data to assess the sensibility of our method to block size and signal-to-noise ratio. The synthetic data are generated by using the domains found by Dixon et al.constant, we computed ^ K and the corresponding ^ t k s using the procedure described in Section 2. The upper part of<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2</ref>displays the histograms of the estimated change-points for c = 0.1, c = 0.2 and c = 0.5. The black dots correspond to the true change-points, and the bars indicate the frequency of each estimated change-point. One can observe that both the change-points and the number of changepoints are well estimated even in low signal-to-noise ratio frameworks (except for c = 0.1). The bottom part of<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2</ref>displays the log-likelihood curves (up to some constants) with respect to K for the same values of c, obtained on a given simulated matrix. The dotted line indicates the location of the estimated number of change-points. Even when the signal-to-noise ratio is small, the estimated number of change-points ^ K corresponds to the true number of change-points K *. When the signal-to-noise ratio is too small, i.e. for c = 0.1 here, some model selection issues arise.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2</ref>shows that for such signal-to-noise ratio, the method provides some spurious change-points within the blocks having the lowest mean. When c = 0.1, the value of the mean in the first diagonal block is very low (0.28) and very close to 0. Nevertheless, when taking the true number of blocks, the true change-points are recovered. We also assessed the performanceof our methodology in the Poisson framework, and we obtained similar results, which are not reported here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Resampling of the data</head><p>In this second analysis, we first get the boundaries found by<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Dixon et al. (2012)</ref>in all the chromosomes of the hESCs. We shall call the corresponding blocks the Ren domains. From these domains, we generate a set of diagonal blocks ðD 1 ; :::; D K Þ, such that (i) the size of each block is drawn in the empirical distribution of Ren domain lengths and (ii) the cumulated number of positions is not4300. Once the block sizes are drawn, we choose at random a human chromosome, and for each diagonal block D k , a Ren domain in this chromosome is randomly selected, and observations in block D k are resampled from the Ren domain data. Accordingly, the data outside the diagonal blocks are simulated by resampling from the data of the E 0 Ren domain in the selected chromosome. This strategy is repeated 100 times to obtain 100 interaction matrices. Compared with the previous simulation design, one can observe that the change-point positions now change from one dataset to the other, and that the data are not anymore simulated according to a negative binomial distribution. While the statistical analysis of datasets generated from this second simulation setting is more difficult, it allows one to visit more realistic data configurations closely similar to real data. We report here the results obtained when the simulated data are analyzed with Model (5) (B), the results obtained with Model (5) (P) being similar.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 3</ref>(left and center) displays two log-likelihood curves (up to some constants) as a function of the number of changepoints. The solid and dotted lines indicate locations of the true and estimated number of change-points, respectively. One can observe that while the maximum is not always achieved at the true number of change-points K Ã , the estimated value ^ K corresponding to the maximum likelihood is still fairly close to K Ã. The true and estimated numbers of change-points are identical for 91 of the 100 simulations, and the absolute difference j ^ K À K Ã j is never 42 except for one example. To further assess the quality of the estimated segmentation compared with the true one, we computed the Hausdorff distance between these two segmentations defined in the segmentation framework as follows, see<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Boysen et al. (2009)</ref>and Harchaoui and L evy-Leduc (2010):</p><formula>d t * ; ^ t À Á =max d 1 t * ; ^ t À Á ; d 2 t * ; ^ t À Á À Á ; ð11Þ where t * =ðt * 1 ;. .. ; t * K * Þ; ^ t=ð ^ t 1 ;. .. ; ^ t ^ K Þ and d 1 a; b ð Þ= sup b 2 b inf a 2 a ja À bj; ð12Þ d 2 a; b ð Þ=d 1 b; a ð Þ: ð13Þ</formula><p>A small value of d 2 (distance from true to estimate) means that an estimated change-point is likely to be close to a true changepoint.

A perfect segmentation results in both null d 1 and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 2</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Application to real data</head><p>In this section, we applied our methodology to the raw interaction matrices of Chromosomes 13–22 of the hESCs at resolution 40 kb, and we compared the estimated number of blocks and the estimated change-points found with our approach to those obtained by<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Dixon et al. (2012)</ref>on the same data, as no ground truth is available for those datasets. From<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 4</ref>, we can first see that the approach of<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Dixon et al. (2012)</ref>tends to produce, in general, more change-points than our strategy except for Chromosome 22. This can also be seen in<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>, which displays the log-likelihood curves (up to some constants) with respect to K as well as the number of change-points proposed by<ref type="bibr">Dixon</ref>and the variance outside the diagonal blocks are of the same order). In the other case where Models (5) (P) and (B) can be applied, we used the following test procedure for overdispersion under the Poisson model to decide between both segmentations. Considering the data lying in T 0 as defined in (8), we first estimate the mean within this region by</p><formula>ffiffiffiffiffiffi N 0 p Q 0 À ð ^ + ^ 2 Þ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 4 ^ 3 +6 ^ 2 + ^ q % N ð0; 1Þ</formula><p>under the hypothesis that all observations from T 0 arise from the same Poisson distribution. Following this rule, we chose Model (5) (B) only for Chromosomes 1 and 2. We can see from this figure that with the naked eye, the diagonal blocks found with our strategy present a lot of similarities with those found by<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Dixon et al. (2012)</ref>. We did not report the segmentations that we obtained for the Chromosomes 1–22, but they are available from the Web page of the corresponding author http://www.agroparistech.fr/mmip/ maths/essaimia/_media/equipes:membres:page:supplementary_ eccb.pdf.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">CONCLUSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">HiCseg R package</head><p>In this article, we propose a new method for detecting cis-interacting regions in Hi-C data and compare it with a methodology proposed by<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Dixon et al. (2012)</ref>. Our approach described in Section 2 is implemented in the R package HiCseg, which is available from the Web page of the corresponding author http://www.agroparistech.fr/mmip/maths/essaimia/_media/equip es:membres:page:hicseg_1.1.tar.gz and from the Comprehensive R Archive Network. In the course of this study, we have shown that HiCseg is an efficient technique for achieving such a segmentation based on a maximum likelihood approach. More precisely, HiCseg package has two main features, which make it attractive. Firstly, it gives access to the exact solution of the maximum likelihood approach. Secondly, as we can see from<ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 9</ref>and<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>, which give the computational times on synthetic data following Models (5) (G), (P) or (B), HiCseg is computationally efficient, which makes its use possible on real data coming from Hi-C experiments. Note that the computational times of<ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 9</ref>were obtained with a computer having the following configuration: RAM 3.8 GB, CPU 1.6 GHz and those of<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>with a computer having the following configuration: RAM 33 GB, CPU 8 Â 2.3 GHz.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Open questions</head><p>Our methodology could be extended, both to improve the algorithmic efficiency of our method and the modeling of the data. On the one hand, all available approaches work with data binned at the resolution of several kb. However, the original data are collected at the nucleotide resolution. One of the main challenges would be to alleviate the computational burden of the algorithm to fully take advantage of the Hi-C technology high resolution. Recent advances in segmentation algorithms for 1D data, such as those proposed by<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Killick et al. (2012)</ref>or Rigaill (2010), seem promising for dealing with this issue. On the other hand, the modeling could be improved in two directions. First, as observed by<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Phillips-Cremins et al. (2013)</ref>, Hi-C interaction matrices display a hierarchical structure corresponding to regions interacting at different scales. The proposed segmentation model does not account for such a structure but could be improved in such a direction. Second, a more refined modeling of the dispersion could be considered. While assuming a common dispersion parameter for non-diagonal blocks issensible because the signal is very low (and therefore, there is little room for large changes in dispersion), the strategy that we propose could incorporate non-homogeneous dispersion parameters for the diagonal blocks. This could be achieved, for instance, by estimating a dispersion parameter per diagonal block. Note that these two extensions could be implemented in the same efficient algorithmic framework as the one proposed in the article. These extensions will be the subject of a future work.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig.1.</head><figDesc>Fig. 1.

As for the resampled data, they are generated by using the Hi-C data of the chromosomes of the human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) provided by Dixon et al. (2012). The different simulation strategies are further described hereafter. 3.1.1 Fixed block design To evaluate the performance of our methodology in the negative binomial framework, we generated block diagonal matrices according to Model (5) (B) where ð i;j Þ is defined by (4). More precisely, we generated 50 block diagonal interaction matrices of size n = 300 with a structure inspired by the one found by Dixon et al. (2012) for the interaction matrix of Chromosome 19 of the mouse cortex. The different parameters * k ; * 0 and are estimated from this matrix. This resulted in matrices including five diagonal blocks such that * 1 =2:87; * 2 =4:85; * 3 =7:92; * 4 =4:33; * 5 =11:99; * 0 =0:09 and =0:67. Then, for each simulated dataset, new matrices were derived by multiplying the * k s by a constant c 2 f0:1; 0:2; 0:3;. .. ; 1g to reduce the signal-to-noise ratio.

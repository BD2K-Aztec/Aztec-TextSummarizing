				<p>Motivation: Alignment-based taxonomic binning for metagenome characterization proceeds in two steps: reads mapping against a reference database (RDB) and taxonomic assignment according to the best hits. Beyond the sequencing technology and the completeness of the RDB, selecting the optimal configuration of the workflow, in particular the mapper parameters and the best hit selection threshold, to get the highest binning performance remains quite empirical. Results: We developed a statistical framework to perform such optimization at a minimal computational cost. Using an optimization experimental design and simulated datasets for three sequenc-ing technologies, we built accurate prediction models for five performance indicators and then derived the parameter configuration providing the optimal performance. Whatever the mapper and the dataset, we observed that the optimal configuration yielded better performance than the default configuration and that the best hit selection threshold had a large impact on performance. Finally, on a reference dataset from the Human Microbiome Project, we confirmed that the optimized configuration increased the performance compared with the default configuration. Availability and implementation: Not applicable.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Metagenomics is the study of the DNA content of a sample particularly powerful to recover complex mix of organisms, including those difficult to isolate by standard techniques (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hugenholtz et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Padmanabhan et al., 2013</ref>). In the last decade, the advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has quickly shifted metagenomics approaches from low-scale studies to large-scale investigations, thereby creating a need for improvement and development of specific bioinformatic methods. Taxonomic profiling and taxonomic binning are popular methods to assess the taxonomic diversity of a sequenced sample (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Drö ge et al., 2015</ref>). Taxonomic profiling methods aim to estimate the relative abundance of each taxon in the sample by classifying reads using a set of marker-genes specific to each taxonomic clade (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Liu et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Segata et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Sunagawa et al., 2013</ref>) or based on their k-mer composition (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Koslicki et al., 2014</ref>). Taxonomic binning methods aim to assign each individual read to a given taxon within the microbial taxonomy. They are not as fast as taxonomic profiling methods to generate a taxonomic profile. Nevertheless reads binning is a mandatory step for subsequent analysis that require draft genome reconstruction (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Drö ge et al., 2015</ref>). Taxonomic binning algorithms are based either on read alignment strategies or on compositional approaches (such as nucleotide k-mer frequencies), or possibly on a mixture of these two approaches(<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mande et al., 2012</ref>). In this article, we focused on alignment-based taxonomic binning methods, whose principle was introduced by<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Huson et al. (2007)</ref>. Such methods proceed generally in two steps. First, reads are aligned against a reference database (RDB). Then, for each read, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) among the best hits is retrieved. To this end, a threshold is applied to select only hits whose scores lie within a percentage of the best hit score. Several evaluation studies have been published that compare mapper performance for resequencing applications (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Břinda et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Caboche et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Hatem et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Holtgrewe et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Schbath et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Ruffalo et al., 2011</ref>). However, in the context of taxonomic binning, there is still no consensus on which mapper and configuration to use. The most comprehensive study to date was performed in the context of the Human Microbiome Project (HMP), where<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Martin et al. (2012)</ref>compared six mappers and optimized the parameters for the best mapper, CLC (CLCbio website: http://www.clcbio.com), by testing six combinations of two parameter values. Beyond the NGS technology (e.g. read length, sequencing error profile) and the completeness of the RDB, taxonomic binning performance depends on the mapper configuration and the taxonomic assignment strategy. Mappers can have many parameters (e.g. more than 15 alignment and score parameters for Bowtie2), some being numerical and other categorical (often with many levels). It is nearly impossible to evaluate the performance of all parameter configurations to identify the best one. Here, we present a statistical framework to efficiently select the optimal configuration (mapper parameters and best hit threshold for LCA calculation) which maximizes taxonomic binning performance for a given NGS technology and level of RDB completeness. We relied on the design of experiments (DOE) methodology (NIST/SEMATECH e-Handbook of Statistical Methods, http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/, 2015-07-14) to reduce the number of configurations to run while still efficiently analyzing the parameter space. This optimization strategy could be adapted to any NGS technology, applied to different mappers and adjusted according to the targeted microbial complexity and distinct levels of the RDB completeness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Materials and methods</head><p>As previously stated, our objective was to find the optimal parameter configuration for a set of sequencing technologies and mappers. To fulfill this objective, we implemented the two following steps: first, we screened the parameters expected to have the largest effect on the pipeline performance, and then we optimized the values of the selected parameters to select the pipeline configuration leading to the best performance. The first screening step was mandatory because optimization studies can only be performed on a limited number of factors (or parameters). In this step, we relied on previously published studies to select the most influential parameters and reduce the number of parameters to optimize up to five. Then, we used an optimization experimental design to find the optimal parameter configuration. As detailed later, the advantage of the experimental design is to identify the optimal configuration at a minimal computation cost.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Screening pipeline parameters</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">Mappers</head><p>Four mappers were included in this study: BWA-backtrack (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Li and Durbin, 2009</ref>) (version 0.7.4), BWA-MEM (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Li, 2012</ref>) (version 0.7.4), Bowtie2 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</ref>) (version 2.1.0) and TMAP (The Ion Torrent flow sequence mapping, see https://github. com/iontorrent/TMAP) (version 3.0.1). Mappers from the BWA suite include around 20 parameters, mostly integer and Boolean. In addition to &gt;15 alignment and scoring parameters, Bowtie2 offers eight preset modes for fast, sensitive, local or end-to-end mapping. TMAP, which embeds four mappers, is fully customizable with &gt;50 numerical parameters and &gt;20 categorical parameters. To reduce the parameter space, we selected parameters expected to have the largest effect on the taxonomic binning performance. This selection was based on mapper documentation and previously published benchmarks (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Hatem et al., 2013</ref>). We targeted parameters typically controlling the seed characteristics, the clipping or the alignment effort. Briefly, the parameters evaluated for BWA-MEM were minimum seed length (s.length), off-diagonal X-dropoff (zdropoff), trigger reseeding (rseed.length), the clipping penalty (clipping), for TMAP: score threshold (score), soft-clipping (clipping), mapping sequence (mode), for Bowtie2: seed length (s.length), number of errors in the seed (s.error), number of consecutive seed extensions (effort), local or end-to-end mode (mode) and for BWAbacktrack: iterative search (iterative), fraction of missing alignments (align.error), maximal edit distance in the seed (s.error) and seed length (s.length). For each quantitative parameter, we selected lower and upper values based on the mapper documentation but default mapper parameters were also evaluated. For each mapper, the parameters, their corresponding option in the software, the tested values (lower, default and upper values for quantitative parameters and levels for qualitative parameters) are presented in Supplementary Table S2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">Best hit selection threshold</head><p>For each hit j obtained by mapping read i against the RDB, an alignment quality score AS ij was defined as the alignment length minus the edit distance. This score was calculated for each read independently and was not used to compare hits from different reads. Both values could be found in the SAM output (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Li and Durbin, 2009</ref>) irrespective to the mapper. Then for each read i, a hit j was retained as a candidate for LCA calculation if AS ij ! ð1 À bestHitÞ Ã max j AS ij , with bestHit a threshold parameter in<ref type="bibr">[0;1]</ref>. When bestHit ¼ 0 only the best hits (including ties) were retained, and when bestHit ¼ 1, all hits were considered as best hits and retained for the LCA calculation. bestHit was included in our study as the model parameter controlling for the best hit selection; the three tested values for the bestHit threshold parameter were: bestHit ¼ 0; 0:25; 0:5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Optimization plan</head><p>The objective of this study was to find the optimal pipeline configuration for each mapper. However, running the pipeline for all the combinations of the selected mapper parameters and the bestHit values was not feasible, motivating the use of an experimental plan. Indeed, an optimal experimental design ensures to find the best configuration in a minimum number of experiments. In this application, an experiment was a run of the pipeline with a set of parameters and the outcome to optimize was the pipeline performance. The set of experiments to perform are given by the experimental plan. There exists several optimization plans, with different assumptions for the nature of the parameter effects (linear or quadratic) and interactions, and thus leading to different number of experiments. Given that we wanted to evaluate the optimal configurations for four mappers (BWA-backtrack, BWA-MEM, TMAP and Bowtie2) and three sequencing technologies (Roche 454, IT PGM, Illumina HiSeq), we had to make two reasonable assumptions to limit the number of experiments to perform: linear effect of parameters and negligible interactions. Given these assumptions, we chose a Hadamard design. This design relies on a Hadamard matrix, which is an orthogonal matrix with all elements equal either to À1 orþ 1, such that HH T ¼ nI n , where I n is the n Â n identity matrix. This design ensures that the variance of the estimators for the parameter effects are minimal. Plackett and<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Burman (1946)</ref>proposed an algorithm to generate the Hadamard design for a given number of factors. In practice, we used the Nemrodw software (http://www.nemrodw.com) to generate automatically all the Hadamard designs. The À1/þ 1 values in the Hadarmard matrix were replaced by the lower and upper bounds of the interval considered for each factor.<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>presents the Hadamard design used for BWA-MEM; each line corresponds to an experiment, i.e. to a configuration of the pipeline with the values of each parameter (BWA-MEM parameters and bestHit parameter), the original À1/þ 1 values are mentioned into brackets. It should be noted that Hadamard designs are also frequently used as screening designs when the number of parameters to screen is very large. The Hadamard experimental plans for BWA-backtrack, TMAP and Bowtie2 are given in Supplementary Tables S3–S5. Without the experimental plan, testing all the parameter combinations would have led to 162, 243, 216 and 81 experiments while 18, 9, 40 and 45 experiments were tested for, respectively, BWA-backtrack, BWA-MEM, Bowtie2 and TMAP, leading thus to a total of 112 experiments. In practice, these 112 experiments were run on each of the three simulated small studies (Roche 454, IT PGM, Illumina HiSeq, see Section 3). As detailed in Section 2.3, models were built from the performance observed in these experiments, then these models were used to predict the best pipeline configuration for each mapper and each dataset.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">Read categories and performance indicators</head><p>The completeness of the RDB depends on the application. For instance, pathogenic bacteria present in bronchoalveolar lavage sample from patients in intensive care unit are very likely to have at least one genome of their species available in the RDB. On the other hand, species found in environmental samples such as those found in marine ecosystems may have no RDB representation (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Magasin and Gerloff, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Yang et al., 2015</ref>). To cover different levels of RDB completeness, we defined three read categories. (i) Non-stringent, where the genome from which the read derives was present in the RDB, (ii) Reachable, where the genome was absent from the RDB, however the RDB included at least two genomes of the same species. (iii) Unreachable, where the genome was absent from the RDB and the RDB did not include any genome of the same species. Therefore, the best possible prediction for an unreachable read was the LCA among the closest genomes present in the RDB (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S1</ref>). Considering these three read categories, we introduced five performance indicators: (i) the proportion of mapped reads, (ii) the proportion of non-stringent mapped reads mapped at the correct position along the correct genome sequence, (iii) the pipeline running time, (iv) the proportion of mapped reachable reads correctly predicted at the species rank, abbreviated 'reachable' thereafter, (v) the proportion of mapped unreachable reads correctly predicted at the expected rank or at a higher rank (i.e. the predicted taxon should be the best possible prediction or any taxon among its parents), abbreviated 'unreachable' thereafter. The first three indicators referred to the intrinsic quality of the mapper, while the other two indicators evaluated the performance of the whole taxonomic binning pipeline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">Models</head><p>For each mapper, the taxonomic binning pipeline was run for all the configurations given by the experimental plan of the mapper. For example, BWA-MEM pipeline was run for the nine configurations described in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. The five individual performance indicators described earlier were computed from the outputs of each pipeline run. Then the performance indicators were modeled using logistic and Weibull regression models. The logistic model (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">McCullagh and Nelder, 1989</ref>) was used for proportion performance indicators (lying in ½0; 1), and the Weibull model (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Kalbfleisch and Prentice, 2011</ref>) was used for the running time. A linear effect for all the continuous covariates was assumed without interaction. For instance, the following logistic model was used to study the effect of parameters and to predict the proportion of reads mapped with BWAMEM: logitðp i Þ ¼ b 0 þ b 1 Â s:length i þ b 2 Â zdropoff i þ b 3 Â re-seed: length i þ b 4 Â clipping i þ b 5 Â bestHit i , with i ¼ 1. .. 9, with p i the observed proportion of mapped reads, s:length i the seed length value, zdropoff i the off-diagonal X-dropoff value, reseed:length i the trigger reseeding, clipping i the clipping penalty and bestHit i the best hits threshold value in the i th ; i ¼ ð1. .. 9Þ row of the BWA-MEM experimental plan (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3">Optimal mapper configuration</head><p>Using the previous models, it was then possible to predict each performance indicator, for any combination of the values of the parameters. For example, using the BWA-MEM mapper, the proportion of mapped reads can be predicted for s:length ¼ 23, zdropoff ¼ 80, reseed:length ¼ 1, clipping ¼ 5 and bestHit ¼ 0 (although this pipeline configuration was not included in the experimental plan): proportion mapped ¼ expð^ lÞÞ=ð1 þ expð^ lÞÞÞ,</p><formula>with ^ l ¼ ^ b 0 þ ^ b 1 Â 23þ ^ b 2 Â 80 þ ^ b 3 Â 1 þ ^ b 4 Â 23 þ ^</formula><p>b 5 Â 5 þ ^ b 6 Â 0 and ^ b 0 to ^ b 6 the parameters of the fitted logistic model for the proportion of mapped reads. In practice, the performance indicators were predicted for all the combinations of the parameter values presented in Supplementary Table S2. Then, to have a single indicator which acts as a compromise between the five individual performance indicators, we defined a composite performance indicator (CPI) as a weighted sum of the individual performance indicators. Since read indicators had values in ½0; 1, to compute the CPI we standardized the running time with the minimum taken over all predicted running times for a given mapper: std:time ¼ minðtimeÞ=time. Finally, we retained three parameter configurations: the 'best', maximizing the CPI, the 'worst', minimizing the CPI and theFigures within brackets correspond to the À1/þ 1 values in the corresponding Hadarmard matrix.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Simulated studies</head><p>We designed small and large studies, each containing a simulated metagenome sample and a RDB. The small studies were used for the taxonomic binning pipeline optimization, while the large one was used to evaluate how predicted parameter configurations scale to larger and more realistic datasets. The simulated metagenome used for the small studies included reads from the three categories to cover a large range of applications: 26% of non-stringent reads, 27% of reachable reads and 47% of unreachable reads. Among unreachable reads, the taxonomic rank of the best possible prediction was genus for 33%, family for 11%, order for 18%, class for 27% and phylum for 11%. Based on this metagenome, three datasets of 500 000 reads each were simulated using Grinder 0.5.3 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Angly et al., 2012</ref>) for three sequencing technologies: Roche 454 (average read length ¼ 450 bp, SD ¼ 50), Ion Torrent PGM (average read length ¼ 200 bp, SD ¼ 20) and Illumina HiSeq (read length ¼ 100 bp) (see Grinder profiles in Supplementary Data, Section 2). The corresponding small RDB contained 356 sequences from 52 species. Thereafter, we refer to the small454, smallPGM and smallHiSeq studies while mentioning the simulated reads described earlier and the small RDB on which they were mapped. The metagenome simulated for the large study included only reachable reads from 287 bacterial strains, 2 fungi and 7 archaeal bacteria. For this metagenome, we simulated an Illumina HiSeq dataset of 12.5 10 6 read pairs, using the same Grinder profile as for the smallHiSeq. The corresponding large RDB was the HMP RDB (see later). Thereafter, the largeHiSeq study refers to the large Illumina HiSeq dataset mapped against the large HMP RDB.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">HMP mock community</head><p>We validated the optimized configuration on a spiked dataset, the HMP Microbial Mock Community dataset (Even, Low Concentration, 454 GS FLX Titanium, SRA accession SRX030841). This dataset contains 1 386 198 reads from a mock sample made of a genomic DNA mixture obtained from 20 bacterial plus 1 archaeal spiked strains. The detailed list of the spiked organisms can be found in<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Martin et al. (2012)</ref>. Reads with quality score &lt; 20 were trimmed, and reads with length &lt; 25 bp were filtered out. A RDB was built from the HMP Reference Genome Database (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Martin et al., 2012</ref>). Sequences without reference to the NCBI taxonomy, redundant sequences, very short sequences (&lt;100 bp) and sequences with a number of ambiguous bases &gt; 0.01% of the sequence length were filtered out. This RDB included 179 988 of the 188 039 sequences initially present in the HMP database, corresponding to 3941 species. Since the HMP mock community only contained non-stringent and reachable reads, we favored reachable and non-stringent indicators in the CPI. So for this study, we used weights 1, 2, 0.8, 4 and 0.3 for the five indicators (resp. proportion mapped, correct position, time, reachable and unreachable). In the following, for the optimization study, we focused on results obtained on the small454 study as the HMP mock community was sequenced on this platform. (Results obtained on the smallPGM and smallHiSeq studies are available as Supplementary Data.)<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>presents the predicted versus observed values for all the performance indicators. 'Observed' values are the performance indicators obtained on the 112 experiments of the experimental plan (including all the mappers), while 'predicted' values are the performance predicted with the logistic and Weibull models. The upper panel corresponds to the ½0; 1 performance indicators predicted with logistic models, while the lower panel corresponds to the running time predicted with a Weibull model. The fit of the models was pretty good, except for the unreachable indicator corresponding to the experiments with bestHit ¼ 0.25, for which we observed a departure from the linearity assumption. Similar results were obtained from the smallPGM and smallHiSeq studies (Supplementary Figs S2 and S3).<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>presents the odds ratios and the hazard ratios of the parameter effects (estimated, respectively, from the logistic and the Weibull models), obtained on the small454 study, for each mapper and performance indicator. An odds ratio above 1 corresponds to a 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0, the proportion of reads mapped at the correct position (blue dots), the proportion of correct predictions among reachable reads (green dots) and the proportion of correct predictions among unreachable reads (yellow dots). The lower panel presents the predicted versus observed running time, in seconds. Unreachable indicators for experiments with bestHit ¼ 0.25 are identified with an asterisk positive effect on the proportion performance indicators and a hazard ratio above 1 corresponds to a decrease of the running time. With BWA-MEM, the s.length parameter had an effect on the proportion of mapped reads. As expected, longer seeds led to a smaller proportion of mapped reads. Furthermore, higher clipping penalty increased the proportion of reads mapped at the correct position. The TMAP clipping parameter had an important effect on several indicators. As expected, limited clipping decreased the proportion of mapped reads but increased the proportion of reads mapped at the correct position. Limited clipping also increased the proportion of correct predictions among unreachable reads. The Bowtie2 mode (local or end-to-end) was the most important parameter. Local modes ('L1' and 'L2') had negative effects compared with end-to-end ('ETE1') mode on all the indicators, excepted on the proportion of mapped reads. BWA-backtrack was less sensitive than other mappers to parameters modification, except for the iterative parameter that decreased (resp. increased) the proportion of correct predictions among reachable (). The dark grey segments thus represent on all barplots the cost on each indicator to build the best configuration</p></div>

Decreasing the number of errors in the seed (s:error) also decreased the mapping time. The bestHit had no effect on the proportion of mapped reads nor the proportion of reads mapped at the correct position because this parameter was only used for LCA calculation after the mapping steps. This parameter strongly impacted the performance of the reachable and unreachable indicators. Larger bestHit values increased the proportion of correct predictions among unreachable reads because more mapping hits were considered for the LCA calculation, and conversely decreased the proportion of correct predictions among reachable reads because prediction ranks were too high (not specific enough). Hence, no configuration maximizing all the indicators simultaneously could be found. That explained why we had to find a tradeoff between indicators using a weighted score. For the smallPGM study, the impact of the mapper parameters on performance indicators was very similar to what was observed on the small454 study, while some specific effects were observed for the smallHiSeq study, such as the effect of the iterative parameter on BWA-backtrack correct positions (Supplementary Figs S4 and S5).</p></div>

Observed and predicted values were close, highlighting the high generalization ability of the prediction models, except for configurations with bestHit ¼ 0.25 (this is the case for all default scenarios), for which the predictions are globally above the observed values. As expected, the CPI increased from the worst, then to the default and then to the best pipeline configuration. This highlights the ability of our method to identify configurations that improve performance. The same results were observed in the smallPGM and the smallHiSeq studies (Supplementary Figs S8 and S9). BWA-MEM presented a small difference of CPI between the default and the best configurations, meaning that the default parameters for BWA-MEM were already optimal in our context. The best configurations for the three datasets and the four mappers can be found in Supplementary Table S6.<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>presents the predicted performance indicators for each mapper and sequencer, obtained with the best configuration, along with the maximum value of each performance indicator. In the small454 study, TMAP mapped 100% of the reads, BWAMEM mapped more than 95% of the reads and Bowtie2 could map a maximum of 66% of reads but the best configuration only mapped 52%. BWA-backtrack did not manage to map more than a quarter of the reads. Indeed, BWA-backtrack was developed and optimized to align short reads (&lt;100 bp) and failed to map the Roche 454 simulated reads which had an average length equal to 450 bp. The proportion of reads mapped at the correct position among mapped non-stringent reads was close to 100% for all mappers, except for BWA-backtrack. As the weight of the reachable indicator was very high in the CPI, all the mappers had a reachable indicator value close to their maximum value for the best configuration. However, the price to reach this maximum value was paid for at the expense of the unreachable indicator. This was true for all the mappers. The largest drop was observed for TMAP, which could theoretically reach 79% for the unreachable indicator but got 23% under the best configuration. Using more balanced weights for the reachable and unreachable indicators would reduce this gap. The shortest running times were obtained by BWA-backtrack and BWA-MEM, while TMAP running time was particularly long. Performance indicator values predicted in the smallPGM study were close to those predicted in the small454 study. BWA-backtrack presented better performance in the smallHiSeq study than in thetwo other studies, with a larger predicted proportion of mapped reads, and reads mapped at a correct position. As expected, the predicted running time decreased with the read length (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S6</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Generalization to a larger metagenomic sample and RDB with different composition</head><p>We evaluated how predictions generalized to both a larger RDB and to a larger metagenomic dataset with a different taxonomic composition. We evaluated the pipeline performance on the largeHiSeq study under the best, default and worst configurations obtained on the smallHiSeq study, for the four mappers. First, Bowtie2 failed to scale to realistic-sized metagenomic samples and RDBs: worst and default configurations were still running after 30 days. Second, we observed similar profiles for all the performance indicators for the three remaining mappers (<ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>). Even though profiles were similar for the proportion of mapped reads, the values obtained on the largeHiSeq study were higher because it only included reachable reads while the smallHiSeq study also included unreachable reads, leading thus to a smaller proportion of mapped reads. We also observed a drop of the reachable indicator between the worst and default configurations for TMAP. This drop was already observed between predicted and observed smallHiSeq but was greater on largeHiSeq. Although it was not testable with the Hadamard design, we suspect here an interaction between the clipping and bestHit parameters. Indeed, the default configuration allows right clipping with bestHit ¼ 0.25, while the worst configuration does not allow clipping, with bestHit ¼ 0.5. Allowing clipping with a non-null bestHit value tends to make more predictions at higher ranks than not allowing clipping with a very large bestHit value. We also compared the observed running times in the smallHiSeq and largeHiSeq studies for five configurations, corresponding to the minimum, maximum and the three quartiles of the predicted time distribution obtained in the smallHiSeq study.<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>presents the running times scaled for 250 000 pairs of reads for BWA-MEM, TMAP and BWA-backtrack. All the configurations for Bowtie2 and the configuration corresponding to the maximum running time for BWA-backtrack are not presented, because running times exceeded 30 days. For BWA-MEM and TMAP, the scaled running times were highly similar for the two studies. For BWA-backtrack, we observed the same running time ordering between the two studies but the observed running time values were not equal when scaled for the number of reads. Thus, contrary to BWA-MEM and TMAP, the BWA-backtrack running time did not increase linearly with the number of reads in the dataset but was also impacted by the size/composition of the RDB.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Validation on HMP mock community</head><p>We applied the taxonomic binning pipeline on the HMP mock community with the best, default and worst configurations obtained on the small454 study, for the three mappers suitable for Roche 454 reads (BWA-MEM, TMAP and Bowtie2).<ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>presents the predicted proportion of the 21 spiked organisms at two taxonomic ranks, species and family. At each rank, a barplot represents the proportions of (i) unmapped reads, (ii) reads assigned at a higher taxonomic rank, (iii) reads assigned to a wrong taxon (i.e. not in the direct lineage of one of the 21 spiked strains) and (iv) reads assigned to each of the 21 expected strain lineages. As a reference for the expected proportions of spiked strains, we used the relative genome depth obtained by<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Martin et al. (2012)</ref>with the CLC mapper on the same sample [sequenced on Illumina GAIIx in<ref type="bibr">Martin et al. (2012) article]</ref>. Although results presented by<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Martin et al. (2012)</ref>were obtained with another sequencer, the taxon proportions attributed to the spiked organisms were highly consistent with the proportions we observed. Unfortunately, the proportion of unmapped reads and reads incorrectly assigned to other species could not be retrieved from<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Martin et al. (2012)</ref>. Thus, we also presented the predicted proportion of the 21 spiked organisms at the species and family ranks, after removal of unmapped, incorrect and reads assigned at higher ranks (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S10</ref>). We observed a lower consistency between HMP predictions and Bowtie2 and TMAP predictions for the default and worst configurations. Best configurations and HMP results were still highly consistent, whatever the mapper. For each mapper, the best configuration retrieved all the spiked organisms, and the proportion of reads assigned at the species level was very high. Indeed, by definition, the reachable indicator contributed highly to the CPI, leading to an increased proportion of reads correctly predicted at the species rank under the best configuration, compared with the default and worst configurations. For all theTaxonomic binning optimizationmappers under the best configuration, 93–95% of the mapped reads were assigned at the species rank while this proportion dropped to 60% for TMAP and Bowtie2 when using the default configuration and to 49% for Bowtie2 when using the worst configuration. These results were consistent with the simulations. Unfortunately, at the species rank, we also observed that TMAP default settings predicted more reads at a higher rank than the worst configuration. The same behavior was observed in the optimization study on the small454 study: as can be seen in Supplementary<ref type="figure">Figure  S6</ref>, the predicted reachable indicator presented a 10 points increase between the worst and default configurations with TMAP, while the observed reachable indicator was stable between the worst and default configurations (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S7</ref>). As already mentioned, this drop was probably due to an interaction between the clipping and the bestHit parameter. Finally, BWA-MEM under the best configuration was at least 3.8 times faster than both other mappers (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#tab_7">Table S7</ref>).</p><formula>0.0 0.4 0.8 0.0 0.4 0.8 0.0 0.4 0.8 0.0 0.4 0.8 0.0 0.4 0.8 0.0 0.4 0.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion and conclusion</head><p>In this article, we proposed a strategy based on the DOE methodology to compare mappers, study the effect of parameters and select the configuration that optimizes the taxonomic binning performance, for three main sequencing technologies in the field of metagenomics.</p><p>To this purpose, we designed an optimization experimental plan to find the best pipeline configuration while running a minimal number of configurations on simulated datasets. The DOE methodology made it possible to obtain precise parameter estimations at a minimal experimental cost. Based on previously published studies, we selected candidate parameters and then used a Hadamard design to find the pipeline configuration leading to the optimal performance. We could also have used in a first step, a screening experimental design to select the most influential parameters (instead of relying on published benchmarks) but given the large number of conditions we considered (4 mappers and 3 sequencing technologies), carrying out an experimental design for both the screening and the optimization steps was too cumbersome. For this large-scale optimization study, we assumed a linear effect of parameters and the absence of interactions, leading us to use a Hadamard design. For most of the configurations, we observed a good consistency between observed and predicted performance indicators (except for a possible interaction effect between the clipping and bestHit parameters on the reachable indicator for TMAP). A possible extension of this work would be to focus on a particular mapper and a read sequencing technology, and to use an alternative optimization experimental plan that allows us to study quadratic effect of parameters and interactions. For example, we could use classical surface response experimental plans [e.g. central composite, Doehlert, Box-Behnken designs (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lundstedt et al., 1998)]</ref>relaxing the previous assumptions at the cost of more experiments but still reasonable for such a tailored application.Contrary to previous studies, we defined performance indicators related to both the performance of the mapper itself (proportion of mapped reads, reads mapped at the correction position and running time) and to the whole taxonomic binning strategy (reachable and unreachable indicators). The unreachable indicator was particularly important to evaluate the binning strategy in case of incomplete RDB. However, this indicator favored high rank predictions (e.g. superkingdom) for unreachable reads because best possible prediction and correct prediction at a higher rank were both considered to be correct. To limit this effect, predictions made at a higher taxonomic rank than the rank of the best possible prediction could be down-weighted (e.g. using the distance between the prediction rank and the best possible rank). Interestingly, our study showed that for each mapper, no more than two mapper parameters had a significant effect on the performance. It also highlighted the importance of the best hit threshold on the reachable/unreachable performance indicators. Moreover, to select the best configuration, we defined a CPI as the weighted sum of the five performance indicators where the choice of the weights highly depends on the targeted application. The reachable indicator received a higher weight, because the HMP RDB was complete (in terms of reference sequences corresponding to the spiked species), and low-rank taxonomic predictions were preferred. In contrast, with incomplete RDB, the unreachable indicator should receive a higher weight. For resequencing applications, the proportion of mapped reads, the proportion of reads mapped at the correct position, and the time would be the only three indicators with a non-zero weight. Hence, the advantage of the CPI is to cover many applications using the same prediction model, just by adjusting the weights of the performance indicators. Finally, we evaluated the ability of the predicted performance to scale to both larger datasets and RDB with a different composition than the ones used in the optimization study. Although, our main indicators appear to well generalize, it would be safer for a targeted application to use the RDB envisioned for the final application when running the experiments for the pipeline performance optimization. As regards the simulated metagenomic dataset, it should have ideally the same taxonomic complexity than the real metagenomic samples, but with a limited number of reads so that the optimization study remains computationally feasible. In conclusion, we hope this computationally tractable statistical framework will contribute to improve taxonomic binning performance by providing rational criteria to optimize any mapper configuration for a given application. Conflict of Interest: none declared.</p></div>

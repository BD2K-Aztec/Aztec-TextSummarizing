				<p>We present GeneNet Toolbox for MATLAB (also available as a set of standalone applications for Linux). The toolbox, available as command-line or with a graphical user interface, enables biologists to assess connectivity among a set of genes of interest (&apos;seed-genes&apos;) within a biological network of their choosing. Two methods are implemented for calculating the significance of connectivity among seed-genes: &apos;seed randomization&apos; and &apos;network permutation&apos;. Options include restricting analyses to a specified subnetwork of the primary biological network, and calculating connectivity from the seed-genes to a second set of interesting genes. Pre-analysis tools help the user choose the best connectivity-analysis algorithm for their network. The toolbox also enables visualization of the connections among seed-genes. GeneNet Toolbox functions execute in reasonable time for very large networks (10 million edges) on a desktop computer. Availability and implementation: GeneNet Toolbox is open source and freely available from http://avigailtaylor.github.io/gntat14.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>In search of the genetic causes of diseases, high-throughput experiments, such as genome-wide association and gene expression studies, are often used to find putatively causative genetic variants. Such experiments implicate many genes ('seed-genes'); to gain insights into the biological mechanisms through which these genes' variants exert their effects, we often explore the hypothesis that the seed-genes participate in a shared biological pathway or process. To this end, within a given biological network, (say, a protein–protein interaction (PPI) or gene co-expression network), we can count the direct connections between the seedgenes [seed-genes and direct connections between them comprise the 'direct network' (see Supplementary<ref type="figure">Figure S1A</ref>)], and determine if this 'direct seed connectivity' is more than expected by chance. Broadly speaking, there are two ways to assess direct seed connectivity within a network of interest: In 'seed randomization' (SR), we keep the network the same, randomly select gene-sets equal in size to the set of seed-genes, and obtain an empirical P-value by comparing the direct seed connectivity to the connectivity of the random gene-sets (see Supplementary<ref type="figure">Figure  S2A</ref>); conversely, in 'network permutation' (NP), we keep seed-genes the same, permute the edges of the network many times (while preserving node degree and network clustering structure), and obtain an empirical P-value by comparing the direct seed connectivity in the real versus permuted networks (see Supplementary<ref type="figure">Figure S2B</ref>and Supplementary Information for algorithmic details). Sometimes, experimental biases influence seed-gene selection; for example, when using RNA-sequencing to call differentially expressed genes, there is a length bias towards longer transcripts (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Oshlack and Wakefield, 2009</ref>). In such cases, gene attributes affected by these biases must be accounted for when assessing direct seed connectivity. In SR, we can do this by matching gene attributes of randomized gene-sets to the real set of seed-genes (see Supplementary<ref type="figure">Figure S3</ref>; note this approach will not work if seed-genes have unique attributes). In other scenarios, the biological network used to determine direct seed connectivity may be subject to an ascertainment bias; for example, gene–gene connections reported in PPIs are biased by the number of studies pertaining to processes in which gene products participate (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Rossin et al., 2011</ref>). With SR, we can account for an ascertainment bias by matching randomized genes to real seed-genes by degree. However, if such a bias is the primary concern, then NP should be used to better account for node degree [on condition that the network in question can be sufficiently permuted, while preserving its clustering structure (see Additional features)]. NP can also be used to evaluate three further properties of the seedgene network [proposed in (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Rossin et al., 2011</ref>), but renamed here]: 'seed direct degrees mean'; 'seed indirect degrees mean'; and 'common connectors degrees mean'. [The latter two properties use the 'indirect network' among seed-genes (see Supplementary<ref type="figure">Figure S1B</ref>); Supplementary Figures S4–S6 explain these properties.] Last, NP can help identify which seedgenes, if any, might be hubs in the direct network (see Supplementary<ref type="figure">Figure S4</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Existing platforms</head><p>A popular implementation of NP is the online resource Disease Association Protein-Protein Link Evaluator (DAPPLE) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Rossin et al., 2011</ref>). Crucially, unlike other implementations of NP (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Alexeyenko et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Poirel et al., 2011</ref>), the DAPPLE NP algorithm preserves not only node-degree but also network *To whom correspondence should be addressed. ß The Author 2014.

However, DAPPLE has important limitations: its web-based interface forces users to compete with global users for resources and is a bottleneck in any high-throughput pipeline; in addition, users are constrained to use DAPPLE's built-in PPI. GeneNet Toolbox addresses these problems: it is standalone, can be run from the command-line, and allows flexible input. Moreover, it employs a MATLAB-optimized NP algorithm that preserves both node degree and clustering structure (see Supplementary Information for a performance comparison), calculates the same network properties for lists of seed-genes as DAPPLE, and also enables additional analyses (described later).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">FEATURES</head><p>Users access GeneNet Toolbox via a graphical user interface, or by calling command-line functions (see user manual available as Supplementary Information). The toolbox enables users to assess seed-gene connectivity in a user-specified network using either SR or NP. With SR users can account for gene-attributes. Two extensions are available for both methods. The first restricts an analysis to a specified sub-network of the primary biological network (a 'background'; see Supplementary<ref type="figure">Figure S7</ref>), thus enabling the user to assess the connectivity of seed-genes within a particular genic context, rather than against a 'wholegenome' background. This might be useful, for example, in the analysis of a behavioural disorder, when a user might want to compare the connectivity of seed-genes to genes associated with behaviour, rather than to all genes. The second extension calculates connectivity from the initial seed-genes to a second set of interesting genes (a 'backbone'; see Supplementary<ref type="figure">Figure S8</ref>). Thus, for example, in analysing the genetic causes of a disease, a user could assess connectivity of seed-genes to previously identified candidate-genes for that disease. The extensions can be combined (see Supplementary<ref type="figure">Figure S9</ref>). If available, multiple processors can be used to reduce run-time. To visualize the seed-gene direct network users choose the 'quickview' option, or output the network as a tab-delimited text file formatted for Cytoscape (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Smoot et al., 2011</ref>). Input files are tab-delimited text files; results files are text files.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Additional features</head><p>As noted above, when network ascertainment bias is of concern (e.g. in a PPI), seed-gene connectivity is likely assessed more accurately with NP than SR. However, for NP to work it must be possible to permute a network sufficiently while preserving its clustering structure. To assess a network's suitability for NP, we provide a pre-analysis tool 'Network permutation analyser' (see user manual). The tool summarizes a network's clustering structure using the global and mean local clustering coefficients, (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Luce and Perry, 1949</ref>;<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Watts and Strogatz, 1998</ref>), comparing these attributes to those obtained for permuted networks. Heuristic measures indicating the effect of network permutations are also provided: for N permutations (set by the user) the tool: (i) shows the mean percentage of edges remaining unbroken per permutation; and (ii) plots the percent of edges remaining unbroken after</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" validated="true"><figDesc>Table 1.

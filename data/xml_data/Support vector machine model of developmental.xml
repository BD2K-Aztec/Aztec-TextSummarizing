				<p>Motivation: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders with clinical heterogeneity and a substantial polygenic component. High-throughput methods for ASD risk gene identification produce numerous candidate genes that are time-consuming and expensive to validate. Prioritization methods can identify high-confidence candidates. Previous ASD gene prioritization methods have focused on a priori knowledge, which excludes genes with little functional annotation or no protein product such as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Results: We have developed a support vector machine (SVM) model, trained using brain developmental gene expression data, for the classification and prioritization of ASD risk genes. The selected feature model had a mean accuracy of 76.7%, mean specificity of 77.2% and mean sensitivity of 74.4%. Gene lists comprised of an ASD risk gene and adjacent genes were ranked using the model&apos;s decision function output. The known ASD risk genes were ranked on average in the 77.4th, 78.4th and 80.7th percentile for sets of 101, 201 and 401 genes respectively. Of 10,840 lncRNA genes, 63 were classified as ASD-associated candidates with a confidence greater than 0.95. Genes previously associated with brain development and neurodevelopmental disorders were prioritized highly within the lncRNA gene list.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is the umbrella term for the neurodevelopmental disorders: autistic disorder, Asperger's syndrome, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder. It is generally diagnosed at an age greater than four years old based predominantly on the behavioral phenotype described as delayed communication, difficulty acknowledging social cues, and engaging in repetitive behaviors (<ref type="bibr">American Psychiatric Association, 2012</ref>). In 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated the prevalence of ASD at 1 in 68 children aged 8, and this was an increase from the 2007 estimate of 1 in 150 (<ref type="bibr">CDC, 2014</ref>). The increase in prevalence may be attributable to more public awareness and implementation of prescreening technology (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chlebowski et al., 2013</ref>). Twin and sibling studies indicate that ASD etiology is influenced heavily by genetics and to a lesser extent environmental factors (<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kim and Leventhal, 2015</ref>). The actual physiological cause of ASD is currently unknown, but leading theories include imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory synapses and substandard signaling between brain structures due to poor axonal growth (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fakhoury, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">McFadden and Minshew, 2013</ref>). It is possible that a myriad of genetic and environmental factors could lead to distinct physiological conditions convergent on the behavioral phenotype. ASD is complex with hundreds of genes implicated in its etiology. The predominant focus of previous research has been on protein-coding genes, and there is the potential of more genes such as non-coding genes being implicated as well. Disease gene identification studies are usually large-scale and high-throughput. Examples include genome-wide association studies (GWAS), copy number variation studies (CNV) and whole exome sequencing (WES). These studies in themselves are time-consuming and expensive especially when considering the sample size required for an effective study. The output can contain numerous potential candidate genes, which are also expensive and time-consuming to validate, with minimal impact on risk of the disease itself. GWAS studies have been shown to be particularly susceptible to weak SNP associations for ASD (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Anney et al., 2012</ref>). Disease gene prioritization systems seek to determine the confidence for disease association amongst gene lists. While disease gene prioritization methods have become somewhat ubiquitous, they generally do not have methodologies accounting for prioritization of non-coding genes. Support vector machine (SVM) approaches have previously been applied to ASD research.<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bruing et al. (2014)</ref>provided support for a phenotype-genotype relationship by using symptom profiles as features and genetic disorders as classes for a multi-class extension of SVM. Magnetic resonance image (MRI) offers one of the most potentially fruitful routes for ASD diagnostics, and SVM approaches have been applied to MRI data to classify and further characterize the morphology of the disorder.<ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Retico et al. (2016)</ref>used SVM to determine differences in the morphologies between young male and female patients with ASD. A similar method was employed by<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ecker et al. (2010)</ref>on whole-brain structural imaging to reveal a correlation for the distance from the decision boundary and the severity of the disorder. In this study, we have developed a machine learning method to prioritize genes for ASD risk. Based on domain-specific knowledge of ASD, it is hypothesized that expression patterns offer a potential means of prioritization for all gene types for ASD risk. In particular, we design the novel approach of using the normal developmental brain expression patterns found in the BrainSpan dataset to leverage previous research focused primarily on protein-coding genes to classify ASD risk gene candidates. The validity of this approach is supported by weighted gene coexpression network analysis on the BrainSpan dataset, which has shown convergence of ASD risk genes on developmental pathways (<ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Parikshak et al., 2013</ref>). It is further supported by evidence of the potential role in ASD of lncRNAs, whose function is closely linked with their expression patterns (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Derrien et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Necsulea et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Ziats and Rennert, 2013</ref>). In this study, we first generated a gene list of high-confidence developmental ASD risk genes. We were then able to create a support vector machine (SVM) model for ASD risk gene prediction with a 76.7% accuracy capable of prioritizing ASD candidate genes based solely on expression patterns in the developing brain. Utilizing a wrapper methodology and a best-first search method during feature selection, we were able to drastically reduce the dimensionality and identify biologically relevant and novel temporospatial features within the dataset. The performance of the feature subset showed improvement over the full feature set. To further test our model, we used the ASD risk gene list to generate hypothetical loci similar to what would be expected from an association study. The genes within the loci were prioritized to determine the relative rank within the list of the known risk gene. Finally, the model was applied to the prioritization of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes. Overall, the study demonstrates the effective application of a machine learning approach to ASD risk gene identification using normal tissue expression patterns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Materials and Methods</head><p>The machine learning problem in this study can be defined in the following way: genes serving as instances are to be classified for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk using their respective expression profiles which serve as the feature set. A model for this decision would allow the prioritization of gene lists based on the strength of predicted ASD associations. Using known ASD risk genes and non-ASD genes with their expression profiles, we seek to perform supervised training of a model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Datasets</head><p>The BrainSpan Atlas of the Developing Human Brain is a developmental transcriptome dataset compiled by a consortium consisting of the Allen Institute for Brain Science and five collaborating universities (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hawrylycz et al., 2012</ref>). The dataset consists of 524 samples with a developmental time point range from 8 weeks postconception to 40 years of age from 26 brain structures. While the dataset demonstrates a lack of availability for multiple samples at each temporospatial time point in development, the BrainSpan dataset is currently the most comprehensive transcriptome of the human developing brain. Expression values were RNA-sequencing reads that were assembled and aligned using the GENCODE consortium's annotation release v10 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Harrow et al., 2012</ref>). They were in the units of Reads Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (RPKM). A log 2 ðRPKM þ 1Þ transformation was applied to the data. Genes in the dataset were instances, and their expression values for the temporospatial time points acted as features for the training dataset. To build a model for ASD risk gene classification, negative and positive gene instances were required. While many genes can be considered non-ASD, two considerations were made to enhance potential model performance. Genes associated with diseases unrelated to the disease being studied have previously been used as negative controls in prioritization studies in an effort to reduce potential systematic bias (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Erlich et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Moreau and Tranchevent, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Thienpont et al., 2010</ref>), and here we employ that same methodology by using non-ASD disease-associated genes as our negative instances. Since many individuals afflicted with ASD are also diagnosed with some form of intellectual disability (ID) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bakken et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hoekstra et al., 2009</ref>), and there is considerable overlap between ID and ASD-associated genes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Pinto et al., 2010</ref>), ID genes were not among the negative instances. The positive instances were ASD risk genes compiled from the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative Gene database (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abrahams et al., 2013</ref>), AutismKB (<ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Xu et al., 2012</ref>), and De Rubeis et al.'s (2014) large exome sequencing study for de novo mutations in individuals with ASD. To curate for developmental ASD risk genes, the top 85% of the genes based upon expression variance within the BrainSpan dataset were used (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table S1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Support vector machines</head><p>Support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is effective for high-dimensional datasets comprised of real numerical as opposed to categorical values. It is commonly used for biological classification problems (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cortes and Vapnik, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kourou et al., 2014</ref>). Genes within our training dataset are vectors defined as x i 2 Rj0 x i 1 (after normalization) for i ¼ 1;. .. ; l, where i is a temporospatial feature in the BrainSpan dataset and l is the size of the feature vector. The classification of each gene, nonASD or ASD, is defined here as y i 2 fÀ1; þ1g. When the model is trained, the algorithm seeks to maximize the distance between margins for a decision boundary separating the positive and negative instances in hyper-dimensional space. The margins are determined from a subset of the total instances nearest in Euclidian distance to the decision boundary referred to as support vectors. The distance between margins is defined as 2=kxk where x is a vector orthogonal to the decision boundary such that its dot product with a support vector is zero. The sign of the decision function (positive or negative) is used for binary classification. Classification problems generally require richer feature space than what is defined originally within the dataset to separate the variables. Plotting vectors in higher dimensions is computationally expensive, but application of a kernel function allows for model optimization in higher dimensional space without having to plot the points. Popular kernel methods for SVM models include radial basis, linear, polynomial and sigmoidal, and for our initial feature selection and final model after optimization, we used the radial basis function (RBF) kernel:</p><formula>Kðx Á x 0 Þ ¼ expðÀckx À x0k 2 Þ (1)</formula><p>The parameter c determines the 'smoothness' of the decision boundary. For this study, we use the SVM SVC class from the Scikit-learn Python library (<ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Pedregosa et al., 2011</ref>) for all SVM implementations with the exception of the feature selection process where the libSVM package from the WEKA data mining software was used (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hall et al., 2009</ref>). The training dataset was imbalanced, consisting of 366 ASD risk genes as positive instances and 1762 non-ASD disease genes as negative instances, a ratio of 1:4.8. For model construction, there are methods of balancing the dataset such as oversampling using synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chawla et al., 2002</ref>) and randomized under-sampling of the majority class (<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kubat and Matwin, 1997</ref>). However, adjusting class weights within the parameters of the learning algorithm may offer an optimal solution. The class weights balance the misclassification cost in establishing soft margins (see Section 2.2.2) without altering the underlying data space. In this study, we have empirically demonstrated that there is no performance loss in using the class weight parameter versus randomized under-sampling of the majority class for optimized SVM models with the full feature set (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table S2</ref>) based on 50 repetitions of tenfold cross-validations. The SVM algorithm was chosen over other machine learning algorithms due to its effectiveness in producing a more generalized model through its maximization of the decision boundary and not the minimization of training errors (<ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Yang, 2004</ref>). It has been shown to outperform many other learning algorithms on various biological problems, including prediction of proteolytic cleavage (duVerle and<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Mamitsuka, 2012</ref>), DNA-binding residues in proteins (<ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Si et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Wang and Brown, 2006</ref>) and linear B-cell epitopes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Wang and Pai, 2014</ref>). It is favorable due to its low computational cost for training a model and easily optimized parameters. The SVM algorithm also has the benefit of a function output, which allows for gene prioritization (see Section 2.3). To verify its suitability for ASD risk gene prediction, we compared the performance of the weighted SVM model to other commonly used machine learning algorithms (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table S2</ref>). The dataset used for this analysis was balanced through randomized under-sampling of the majority class, and the performance evaluation was the same as outlined in Section 2.2.2 for 50 repetitions of tenfold cross-validations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Feature selection</head><p>Gene expression datasets such as the BrainSpan dataset can have high dimensionality. The feature selection process removes redundant and irrelevant features to improve model performance, reduce computational load, and decrease the ratio of features to samples, which reduces the probability of overfitting. Wrapper methods evaluate feature subsets in the context of the learning algorithm. Given that these methods take into account the learning algorithm that is to be optimized, wrapper methods generally perform better than filtering or embedded techniques especially for gene expression data, but they are computationally expensive (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hira and Gillies, 2015</ref>) and can potentially lead to overfitting (<ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Saeys et al., 2007</ref>). To address potential overfitting in this study, the approach of candidate gene prioritization (see Section 2.3) has been employed as external validation in lieu of an independent test set. In addition to model performance improvement, the methodological approach of the wrapper method allows us further knowledge discovery in evaluating the performance of the model with the addition of each new feature. This is of particular interest in this study given that the features represent temporospatial points in brain development and the molecular etiology of ASD is still unclear. The number of potential feature subsets for a brute force search is equivalent to a power set or 2 N , where N ¼ 524 for our dataset. This is infeasible. Deterministic feature selection methods such as the sequential forward selection (SFS) method, which incrementally adds features in a greedy hill-climbing search, have been used successfully in cancer machine learning studies with expression datasets (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kourou et al., 2014</ref>). In a greedy hill-climbing search, for a machine learning algorithm such as SVM, a feature set of size n and a feature subset F,</p><formula>f SVM ðFÞ where F ff 1 ; f 2 ;. .. ; f n g (2)</formula><p>f i 2 ff 1 ; f 2 ;. .. ; f n g the performance of the classifier is measured by a scoring metric. For this study, overall accuracy was used (TP ¼ true positive, TN ¼ true negative, FP ¼ false positive and FN ¼ false negative): Accuracy ¼ TP þ TN TP þ TN þ FP þ FN</p><formula>(3)</formula><p>After testing multiple performance measures, overall accuracy was determined to be optimal for searching subsets. It showed steady increases and converged on a subset with minimal processing time. The subset is then built in the following manner where t is representative of iterations:</p><formula>if f SVM ðF tÀ1 [ ff i gÞ &gt; f SVM ðF tÀ1 Þ then Set : F t ¼ F tÀ1 [ ff i g (4)</formula><p>if f SVM ðF tÀ1 [ ff i gÞ f SVM ðF tÀ1 Þ then Feature Set ¼ F While SFS is an effective wrapper search method, it does present the possibility of local maxima. One way to partially alleviate this while maintaining a heuristic search is to allow for hill traversal. The best-first search algorithm implements a greedy hill climbing algorithm but allows for backtracking and expansion of previously evaluated nodes. It has also been shown to outperform the greedy algorithm (<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kohavi and John, 1997</ref>). In this study using the WEKA data mining software, we searched the feature subset using the bestfirst search algorithm with the overall accuracy from a fivefold cross-validation using libSVM at default settings as the performance measure (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hall et al., 2009</ref>). The best-first search was forward starting from an empty feature set and allowed for the expansion of five non-improving nodes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Model parameter optimization and performance evaluation</head><p>To improve SVM classification performance with the full and selected feature sets respectively, we optimized the three parameters, cost (C), c and kernel using a grid search approach, which evaluates all combinations based on a performance measure. Parameter optimization for high-dimensional datasets can be sensitive to class imbalance if overall accuracy is used as the performance measure. Optimized parameters can favor a model with low sensitivity where positive instances are in the minority such as ASD genes. Therefore, we used G-mean (geometric mean) as the performance metric, which measures the classifier's ability to balance specificity and sensitivity (<ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Lin and Chen, 2012</ref>):</p><formula>Sensitivity ¼ TP TP þ FN (5) Specificity ¼ TN TN þ FP (6) G mean ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi Sensitivity Â Specificity p (7)</formula><p>C is the penalty assigned for misclassifications. In the maximization of 2=kxk, which alternatively is the minimization of kxk 2 =2 during training of the SVM model, when misclassifications are allowed, the problem takes on the form,</p><formula>min x;e f 1 2 kxk 2 þ C X i e i g (8)</formula><p>where e is the quantification of the misclassification. The c parameter can be found in Equation (1). Previous work has shown that the most efficient method of optimization for C and c is to exponentially increase the values across a range (<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hsu et al., 2003</ref>). In this study, we used C 2 f2 À5 ; 2 À3 ;. .. ; 2 13 ; 2 15 g and c 2 f2 À15 ; 2 À13 ;. .. ; 2 1 ; 2 3 g. Using the radial basis function (RBF) kernel, we measured the performance for each parameter pairing of C and c. Using the linear kernel, we measured the performance for each C. The optimal kernel, C and c parameter combinations were selected based on the highest G-mean returned from tenfold crossvalidations. Model performance was evaluated using sensitivity (Equation 5), specificity (Equation 6), overall accuracy (Equation 3) and the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), which measures the correlation between the predicted and actual classifications on a scale of MCC ¼ Rj À 1 MCC 1 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Matthews, 1975</ref>): MCC ¼ ðTP þ TNÞ À ðFP þ FNÞ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi ðTP þ FPÞ Â ðTP þ FNÞ Â ðTN þ FPÞ Â ðTN þ FNÞ p (9)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Candidate gene prioritization</head><p>To rank candidate genes, we used the output from the SVM model with greater output corresponding to higher rank. To test the ability of the model to prioritize ASD risk genes, we generated gene lists containing at least one ASD risk gene. This methodology was adapted from the work by<ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Piro et al. (2010)</ref>. For each ASD risk gene in the training dataset, we identified N flanking genes on the same chromosome using the GENCODE release v10 annotation. We then constructed a hypothetical locus with 2N þ 1 genes centered on the ASD risk gene. If an ASD risk gene was close to a chromosome terminal, the number of genes in the opposing flank were extended to ensure that each gene list was of equal length. Three gene list lengths were tested: 101, 201 and 401. Genes present in the training dataset were removed from each gene list. The SVM model was trained for each hypothetical locus, and the candidate gene list was prioritized. Model performance was evaluated by the percentile rank assigned to the known ASD risk gene in its respective candidate gene list:</p><formula>Percentile Rank ¼ L N Â 100% (10)</formula><p>In the above equation, L is the number of SVM scores less than the target, and N is the total number of candidate genes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Long non-coding RNA gene candidate prioritization</head><p>The 10 840 lncRNA genes in the GENCODE release v10 were prioritized using the SVM model to further demonstrate its capabilities and performance. The model was built with all instances from the training dataset, the feature subset from feature selection, and the optimized parameters. Confidence measures of the classification (ASD or non-ASD associated) were assigned for each gene. If the instance was classified as positive, the confidence was (1 – false positive rate), and if the instance was classified as negative, the confidence was (1 – false negative rate) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Wang and Brown, 2006</ref>).<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>shows the performance of the support vector machine (SVM) classifier for 50 repetitions of tenfold cross-validations using all 524 features available in the dataset. The model was optimized on the G-means performance measure and used the radial basis function (RBF) kernel with a cost (C) ¼ 8 and c ¼ 0.0078125. The SVM model with the full feature set achieved a mean accuracy of 0.739 with 0.748 sensitivity, 0.737 specificity and 0.385 Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). The receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve for ASD risk gene prediction using the full feature set is shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. The ROC curve is a plot of the true positive rate (sensitivity) versus the false positive rate (1 – specificity) for varying output thresholds of the SVM classifier (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hajian-Tilaki, 2013</ref>), and in this study it was generated using the ROC class from the Scikit-learn Python library (<ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Pedregosa et al., 2011</ref>). The ROC curve and the area under the curve (ROC-AUC) are considered to be the most robust measures of model performance. The ROC-AUC for the full feature set is 0.8045. This value is significantly greater than the random guess value of 0.5. Given the novelty of the study, there are no real means of comparison to other model performance, and therefore the SVM model performance can serve as a benchmark for future models. The heterogeneous nature of ASD warrants against over-optimization as the probability of overfitting may increase, and the current performance appears to be indicative of an effective generalized model.3.2 Wrapper method with best-first heuristic search for feature selection Reduction of the dimensionality for a dataset decreases computational load and the probability of overfitting. Here we demonstrate SVM model performance gain with a selected feature subset over the full feature set. Our methodology applied a forward heuristic bestfirst feature selection search using a wrapper method. Forward searches begin with empty sets and build them incrementally with the addition of one feature at a time, and this approach allows for evaluation of each feature added to what will become the final subset. The best-first search is a modification of the greedy stepwise method and allows for backtracking if no improvement is seen with further feature additions.<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>shows the incremental building of the feature subset. The features are in the order of their additions to the subset, and the overall accuracy is listed for each resulting subset. For example, the feature subset of the primary somatosensory cortex (area S1, areas 3,1,2) (S1C) at 13 post-conception weeks (pcw) had an accuracy of 0.662, and the subset of S1C at 13 pcw and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DFC) at 8 pcw had an accuracy of 0.694. The selected feature model was evaluated with the same parameters as the full feature set model. The specificity of 0.772, accuracy of 0.767 and MCC of 0.419 are all significantly improved over the model with the full feature set, and there was no significant difference in the specificity (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). The selected feature model used the RBF kernel with C ¼ 32 and c ¼ 0:03125. Its ROCAUC of 0.8194 shows a performance improvement over the full feature model (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Prioritization of ASD risk gene candidates using SVM model output</head><p>Given the relatively low number of high-confidence ASD risk genes and the heterogeneity of the disorder, all of the positive instances were used in the training of the model to maximize the available data space. This however precludes the use of an independent test dataset as a means of external validation. As an alternative to the use of an independent test dataset, both models were evaluated on their ability to prioritize hypothetical loci. We generated gene lists for each ASD risk gene and its surrounding genes, and model performance was measured by the ability to highly prioritize the known ASD risk genes. While the lists may contain previously unknown ASD risk genes, a liberal estimate of ASD risk gene frequency in the genome at 2% (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">De Rubeis et al., 2014</ref>) and varied location of CNV's (<ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Liu and Takumi, 2014</ref>) would allow us to assume that a high-performing model would prioritize a known ASD risk gene within the 90th percentile. Since our interests are in the relative ranks of the genes for the hypothetical loci, we perform a form of ordinal regression in ordering by the decision function output. Here we compare the prioritization capability for the selected and full feature set SVM models.<ref type="figure" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>shows the mean percentile rank for known ASD risk genes in their respective hypothetical loci of varying sizes. Again, the selected feature model outperformed the full feature model. The selected feature model showed 2–3% greater mean percentile rank of ASD risk genes for each locus length than the full feature model. The mean percentile ranks increase with the size of the loci, which is to be expected given the assumption that ASD risk genes highly prioritized would remain so in an expanding list.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>shows the distributions of ASD risk genes grouped by percentile rank for the two models. There were little to no genes ranked in or near the 50th percentile for the two models. ASD risk genes were either ranked in the low or high percentiles, and the amounts in each are consistent with the overall accuracy of the models. ASD risk genes classified as positive instances were predominantly in the 95th percentile or above. This is consistent with expectations andThe features are described by the time point when the sample was collected and the brain structure where the sample was collected. They are listed in order of their addition to the cumulative set. The overall accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of each subset is listed. pcw ¼ post conception weeks, yr(s) ¼ years of age.</p><p>Autism risk gene predictionindicative of strong performance for both models. Genes in the lower percentiles were principally classified as negative instances. Given the heterogeneity of the disorders, it is also possible that the misclassified genes are false positives or that their etiology for ASD is independent of brain development.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Application of the SVM model to lncRNAs</head><p>Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes code for transcripts greater than 200 nucleotides in length, which are not translated to peptide sequences. They are ideal genes for testing the performance of an expression-based prioritization model since they lack protein product, generally lack functional annotation, may be more numerous than protein-coding genes in the genome, and are highly expressed in the brain (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Derrien et al., 2012</ref>). They also have high temporospatial expression specificity, and conservation studies have identified them as potentially key developmental regulators (<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Necsulea et al., 2014</ref>). LncRNAs have been found to be differentially expressed in individuals with ASD (<ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Ziats and Rennert, 2013</ref>), but the role of lncRNAs in ASD is still an emerging field of research. To further evaluate the model performance, we prioritized a gene list comprised of the available lncRNA genes within the dataset using the selected feature model. For each gene, confidence values for the prediction were assigned based upon the SVM output for the gene (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#tab_3">Table S3</ref>). Of the 10 840 lncRNA genes, 962 (8.87%) were classified as potential ASD risk genes, but only 63 had a confidence measure greater than 0.95. While an exhaustive investigation of the high-priority candidate lncRNAs and their potential ASD association is outside the scope of this study, we highlight the most interesting genes based on existing annotations as a means of further demonstrating the validity of the approach.<ref type="figure">Table 4</ref>shows four lncRNA genes that are highly ranked for ASD association. CHL1-AS1 is antisense to the ASD risk gene CHL1 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Salyakina et al., 2011</ref>). MALAT1 has been shown to be a regulator of synapse formation (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bernard et al., 2010</ref>). MIAT has been shown to influence cell fate during neurogenesis (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Aprea et al., 2013</ref>). TUG1 has been linked previously to neurodegenerative disorders (<ref type="bibr">Wü u et al., 2013</ref>). Given the limited knowledge of the role of lncRNAs in ASD, the high prioritization of genes with roles in brain development or adjacency to known ASD risk genes demonstrates the high performance of the SVM model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has a complex physiologic etiology. Combinations of environmental and genetic factors causing aberrant development of brain regions have been linked to the disorder (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fakhoury, 2015</ref>). Studies utilizing non-invasive brain imaging procedures such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positronic emission tomography (PET) have also implicated brain structures and biological processes contributing to ASD (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ecker et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Zü rcher et al., 2015</ref>). While the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood, there is a large body of knowledge in the field to be utilized for further study. Although treatment of ASD has been shown to be effective, it is dependent on early detection. Imaging can offer diagnostic input, but the process is expensive and not always practical. Biomarkers may offer the best means for early detection of the disorder, but the complexity of the disorder and the increase in sequencing capacity have led to a multitude of potential targets too numerous to test. The need for an ASD risk gene prioritization system encompassing all gene types is evident. In this study, we employ a novel approach to bridging this gap. By reframing the task of ASD risk gene identification as a supervised machine learning problem, we were able to construct an accurate classification model. Leveraging the existing extensive research on protein-coding genes in ASD and the comprehensive view of the transcriptome for the developing human brain offered by the BrainSpan dataset, we were able to discern a pattern from the expression profile, which distinguishes ASD risk genes. Appling a heuristic search through the possible feature space, we were alsoThree different gene set sizes were tested for the hypothetical loci.the selected and full feature set SVM models for the three gene set sizes. For each hypothetical locus, the percentile rank of the known ASD risk gene within the gene list was calculated, and here those ranks are grouped in 5 percentile point increments able to refine the model through feature selection, which improved performance and implicated potentially critical temporospatial features in the onset of ASD. To test the performance of our model in the absence of an independent test set, we used both standard crossvalidations and the prioritization of candidate genes within hypothetical loci. The performance measures confirmed that the model achieved high accuracy and had the capability to highly prioritize ASD risk genes within gene lists of varying lengths. In light of the gathering evidence that lncRNAs are associated with ASD, we further demonstrated the utility of our model through the prioritization of lncRNA candidates. Biologically significant candidates were highly prioritized, providing further validation to our approach. Collectively, the feature subset has interesting aspects (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>). It is intriguing that while ASD as early developmental disorders can be diagnosed by the age of two years old with standard methods (American Psychiatric<ref type="bibr">Association, 2012</ref>), the developmental time points of the selected features span the entirety of the transcriptome studied (from 8 pcw to 40 years of age). Most notably, the time points are enriched for early development, particularly from 8 pcw to one year of age, and these points were predominantly added to the subset before later developmental time points such as those greater than four years of age. Therefore, the early developmental period appears to have a larger influence on ASD risk gene identification. Co-expression modules enriched with ASD risk genes have been shown to have either dramatic upward or downward trends in expression patterns between 8 pcw to one year of age, which indicates a critical timespan in relation to ASD etiology (<ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Parikshak et al., 2013</ref>). Not surprisingly, the structures that were selected are mainly cortical regions, which are associated with sensory input processing and behavior. Generally, cortical regions have been found to be enlarged in children with ASD around three years of age (<ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Schumann et al., 2010</ref>). Two non-cortical regions selected are the hippocampus and the mediodorsal nucleus of thalamus (MD). Both the hippocampus and the thalamus have been found to be proportionately smaller for individuals between the ages of four and eighteen years old with ASD (<ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Sussman, et al., 2015</ref>). However, there is little to no evidence of a role for the MD in ASD. The selected feature set also contained later development cortical structures. These unanticipated features may present new avenues of research for ASD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>In this study, a novel approach is proposed for knowledge transfer from known ASD risk protein-coding genes to all gene types. We have demonstrated that a model built using only expression patterns within normal brain development as features can accurately classify and prioritize ASD risk genes. This provides a distinct advantage over previous models. It does not require a priori knowledge and allows for the prioritization of non-protein coding genes. It is our hope that this will lay the groundwork for an accurate prioritization tool utilizing this model.Autism risk gene prediction</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>1.</head><figDesc>The mean sensitivity, specificity, overall accuracy and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of each model for 50 repetitions of tenfold cross-validations Full feature set Selected feature set</figDesc></figure>

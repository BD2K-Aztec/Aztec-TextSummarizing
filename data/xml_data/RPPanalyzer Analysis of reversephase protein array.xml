				<p>RPPanalyzer is a statistical tool developed to read reverse-phase protein array data, to perform the basic data analysis and to visualize the resulting biological information. The R-package provides different functions to compare protein expression levels of different samples and to normalize the data. Implemented plotting functions permit a quality control by monitoring data distribution and signal validity. Finally, the data can be visualized in heatmaps, boxplots, time course plots and correlation plots. RPPanalyzer is a flexible tool and tolerates a huge variety of different experimental designs. Availability: The RPPAanalyzer is open source and freely available as an R-Package on the CRAN platform http://cran.r-project.org/</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>In systems biology as well as in biomarker discovery reversephase protein arrays (RPPAs) have emerged as a useful tool for the large-scale analysis of protein expression and protein activation (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Paweletz et al., 2001</ref>). The method follows the basic principle of printing large numbers of crude protein extracts in parallel on a solid phase carrier to form a single array. Multiple slides are printed in parallel and each (sub)array is probed with a different monospecific antibody. To quantify protein expression or protein activation detectable signals are generated via fluorescence, dye precipitation or chemoluminescence. Different methods for calculating and normalizing sample concentrations are available. We implemented this package in the free and open-source R programming environment for statistical computing regarding the fact that R is a widely accepted standard platform for statistical and bioinformatics method exchange (R Development Core<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Team, 2005</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">PACKAGE FEATURES</head><p>RPPA data analysis requires three sources of information: signal intensities gained from the image analysis software GenePix, sample annotation and slide-specific information. After optional background correction, the relative concentration of each sample is calculated. To * To whom correspondence should be addressed. ensure comparability of individual samples a signal normalization method matching the experimental design has to be chosen. Finally, data can be visualized using different plotting methods, can be exported as text file, or R-object. The data analysis workflow is described in detail in the package vignette.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Data input and annotation</head><p>The information describing the experiment is saved in a single folder:</p><p>(1) The sample description is summarized as a tab-delimited text file containing the sample phenodata and the corresponding position in the source plate.</p><p>(2) The slide description file describes array features and contains antibody information.</p><p>(3) Raw signal intensities have to be provided as GenePix result files (gpr files). Data import automatically generates a list with four components. The first data matrix contains foreground signal intensities and a second matrix an estimate of the local background. Each row of the matrices corresponds to a vector of spot intensities and columns link the information to individual arrays. The third and fourth components are matrices with information on samples and arrays. The four lists are kept throughout the analysis and can be exported as text files after each step of the data analysis procedure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Data processing</head><p>Background correction can be performed as an optional first step using the limma package (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ritchie et al., 2007</ref>). The median of replicate spots is used to determine the relative concentration of each detected protein in each sample. In case of serially diluted samples, the relative protein concentrations are calculated using a linear or three parameter logistic model for each sample. The most recent methods use one model to describe the dynamic of all samples of one array.<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Hu et al. (2007)</ref>suggest a non-parametric model implemented in the SuperCurve package (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Coombes et al., 2009</ref>). Another approach is the serial dilution curve algorithm introduced by<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Zhang et al. (2009)</ref>. Both are accessible in the package.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Data normalization</head><p>Each step during the preparation and spotting of samples for RPPA experiments is a potential error source which has an influence on the total protein amount of the individual spot. Thus, a mandatory step in RPPA data processing is the adjustment of</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Data visualization</head><p>The data robustness can be visualized in quality control plots revealing the distribution of all individual data points. Signal validity can be analyzed by comparing blank signals to target-specific signals in scatter plots. Correlation plots are implemented to analyze the correlation of protein expression and any numerical sample attribute. The significance is tested and corrected for multiple testing. Boxplots can be used to visualize the empirical distribution of the data points in order to assess differential expression of proteins in comparison to a control group. Heatmaps are tools for the visualization of protein expression in large sample sets. It is the most common method to show structures of the data with the use of hierarchical clustering. Stimulation time courses (STC) are cellular assays to analyze the time-dependent response of a cellular system to exogenic stimuli such as growth factors or UV radiation.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>shows a time course plot from a STC experiment with raw data summarized as smoothing splines. For additional analysis, the RPPA data list can be exported as tab-delimited text file or bioconductor expression set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">SUMMARY</head><p>We developed an R package addressing the needs for a fast and comprehensive analysis as well as visualization of RPPA data. Raw data are obtained by using GenePix and are supplemented with additional information in a text file format. Previously published software solutions for RPPA data analysis (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Stanislaus et al., 2008</ref>) are not compatible with R and restricted to very limited array designs. Thus, the functionalities offered by our package can easily be integrated into any type of R-based analysis and accepts any array format.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig.1.</head><figDesc>Fig. 1.

				<p>Motivation: Worldwide and substantial mortality caused by the 2009 H1N1 influenza A has stimulated a new surge of research on H1N1 viruses. An epitope conservation has been learned in the HA1 protein that allows antibodies to cross-neutralize both 1918 and 2009 H1N1. However, few works have thoroughly studied the binding hot spots in those two antigen–antibody interfaces which are responsible for the antibody cross-neutralization. Results: We apply predictive methods to identify binding hot spots at the epitope sites of the HA1 proteins and at the paratope sites of the 2D1 antibody. We find that the six mutations at the HA1&apos;s epitope from 1918 to 2009 should not harm its binding to 2D1. Instead, the change of binding free energy on the whole exhibits an increased tendency after these mutations, making the binding stronger. This is consistent with the observation that the 1918 H1N1 neutralizing antibody can cross-react with 2009 H1N1. We identified three distinguished hot spot residues, including Lys 166 , common between the two epitopes. These common hot spots again can explain why 2D1 cross-reacted. We believe that these hot spot residues are mutation candidates which may help H1N1 viruses to evade the immune system. We also identified eight residues at the paratope site of 2D1, five from its heavy chain and three from its light chain, that are predicted to be energetically important in the HA1 recognition. The identification of these hot spot residues and their structural analysis are potentially useful to fight against H1N1 viruses.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The H1N1 influenza A caused two notable pandemics with substantial mortality in 1918 and 2009. Fortunately, it has been * To whom correspondence should be addressed.</p><p>found that some antibodies can work against the Hemagglutinin (HA) proteins in these two pandemics (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Xu et al., 2010</ref>). HA is a homotrimeric glycoprotein. HA monomers are synthesized as precursors that are then cleaved into two proteins, HA1 and HA2, which form the major surface proteins of influenza A viruses. The infection is started by the binding of HA proteins to the sialic acid-containing receptors of target cells and by fusing the viral membrane with the endosomal membrane of the target cells. The viral genome enters and infects the target cells after the binding. So, inhibiting this binding by antibodies is an important way against flu. Previous works have learned that there is an epitope (binding site) conservation that exists between the 1918 and 2009 H1N1 HA proteins (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ekiert et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Xu et al., 2010</ref>). Such epitope conservation enables the older population to avoid infection from 2009 H1N1 because their pre-existing immunity against 1918 H1N1 can neutralize the 2009 H1N1 HA proteins. Thus, studies on these antibody–HA binding interfaces are crucial to understand how the antibodies recognize the antigens. However, there are few studies on the energetic importance of the binding residues in the HA1 protein in complex with the 2D1 antibody. We apply predictive and comparative methods to examine the interfaces between the 2D1 antibody and the HA1 proteins of 1918 and 2009 H1N1, and to investigate an assumed 2D1 binding to the seasonal influenza virus A/Brisbane/59/2007 to understand why 2D1 did not bind to the 2007 strain (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Krause et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Xu et al., 2010</ref>). This 2D1 antibody is a monoclonal antibody from a survivor of the 1918 Spanish influenza (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Yu et al., 2008</ref>), which is believed to bind to HA1s in both of 1918 and 2009 H1N1. Of particular interests, we identify binding hot spot residues from the above mentioned two antibody–antigen interfaces. A binding hot spot is a small fraction of interfacial residues that contribute most to binding free energy (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bogan and Thorn, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Clackson and Wells, 1995</ref>). Their mutations—e.g. alanine mutations—can reduce binding affinity remarkably (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Clackson and Wells, 1995</ref>). We address the problems whether the interfacial mutations from 1918 H1N1's HA1 to 2009's are hot spot residues and whether these mutations make the binding stronger with 2D1. We explain how the computational methods find those antigenic residues that are energetically important in the antibody binding, such as Asn 129 , Lys 157 and Lys 166. These three hot spot residues are actually common between the 1918 and 2009 epitopes of HA1. Their mutations may make the 2D1-antibody binding ineffective.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Q.Liu et al.</head><p>Therefore, they are mutation candidates which may help H1N1 viruses evade the immune system. We also describe and characterize hot spot residues at the paratope site of the 2D1 antibody—e.g. Asp 52 and Arg 97 from the heavy chain and Asn 31 , Trp 91 and Asp 93 from the light chain. Knowledge gained from these binding hot spot studies can be useful to fight against H1N1 viruses in future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">The HA-2D1 binding structures</head><p>We retrieve from the PDB entry 3LZF the crystal structure of the 2D1 antibody binding to the HA proteins of 1918 H1N1 (1918HA1), and from 3LZG the atomic coordinates of the HA proteins of the 2009 H1N1 A/California/04/2009 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Xu et al., 2010</ref>) binding. First, we use PyMOL to align the HA protein structure of 2009HA1 (or 2007HA1) onto the HA protein structure of the 1918 H1N1 in the PDB 3LZF with the antibody coordinates. PyMOL aligns the two HA protein structures to minimize root mean square deviation (RMSD) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Schrödinger, LLC, 2010</ref>). After that, we obtain the computational binding interface of 2009HA1 (or 2007HA1) with the 2D1 antibody by removing the HA coordinates of 1918 H1N1. 2009HA1 (or 2007HA1) in this computational binding interface remains in an unbound state with free side chains. So, we use FoldX (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Schymkowitz et al., 2005</ref>) to repair this interface when fixing the antibody binding site. The repaired interfaces are then used for our subsequent analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Computational methods for predicting hot spots</head><p>Binding hot spot residues can be predicted by computational methods such as by Robetta (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Kortemme and Baker, 2002</ref>), FoldX (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Schymkowitz et al., 2005</ref>), KFC (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Darnell et al., 2008</ref>), GCR (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Li and Li, 2010</ref>) and a Z-score method. Robetta is a simple physical model for estimating the binding energy of hot spots. This method uses all heavy atoms and polar hydrogens to represent proteins and proposes a free energy function for linearly combining such terms as Lennard–Jones potentials, an orientation-dependent hydrogen bond potential, Coulomb electrostatics and an implicit solvation model. Similarly, FoldX (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Schymkowitz et al., 2005</ref>) uses a linear combination of empirical terms to calculate free energy. The empirical terms are hydrophobic and polar solvation, hydrogen bonds (water-intermediate hydrogen bonds included), the Van der Waals terms, Coulomb electrostatics, and so on. Meanwhile, KFC (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Darnell et al., 2008</ref>) uses simple rules to identify binding hot spots. The following features are employed by KFC to represent a residue: physical and chemical features, shape specificity and biochemical contacts such as atomic contacts, hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. Then it uses a decision tree model to produce some rules for classifying hot spots. All these computational methods achieved good prediction performance based on experimental mutations. For example, the overall correlation between the observed and Robetta-calculated changes in binding free energy has an average unsigned error of 1.06 kcal/mol for interface mutations (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Kortemme and Baker, 2002</ref>). Recently, a novel descriptor of atoms and residues, called burial level by GCR (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Li and Li, 2010</ref>), is also proposed to enhance hot spot prediction performance. By this method, an atomic contact graph is built for a protein complex, where vertices are atoms and edges are atom contacts. The burial level of an atom in this graph is defined as the length of the shortest path from this atom to its nearest exposed atom to the bulk solvent. The burial level of an atom or a residue indicates the extent it is buried inside the complex. As the hot spot residues are protected by O-rings (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bogan and Thorn, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Li and Liu, 2009</ref>), hot spot residues always have low solvent accessible surface area (ASA) and high burial levels. But a high burial level is more sufficient than ASA: there are very few highly buried interfacial residues that are not hot spot residues. We have built a hot spot model (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Li and Li, 2010</ref>) based on this concept; and the model has achieved good performance. We have also proposed a Z-score biological significance for capturing the probability of residues occurring in or contributing to protein binding interfaces. This Z-score is actually intended to measure how far away certain properties of a putative contact residue at a binding interface are from those of crystal packing. So, we take crystal packing as the reference state to extract residue pairwise potentials. Then, the potential score of a residue is defined by using a knowledge-based potential function with ASA calculations. After that, a null distribution of this potential score is generated from artifact crystal packing contacts. Finally, the Z-score significance of a contact residue with a specific potential score is determined according to this null distribution. As binding hot spots contribute greatly to binding free energy, they should have big Z-score values. Here, a contact residue is considered as a hot spot residue if its Z-score is &gt;1. Our evaluation on the ASEdb and BID datasets (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Cho et al., 2009</ref>) shows that Z-score is powerful for identifying protein binding hot spots. The details of how to calculate Z-score are given in the Supplementary Material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">A meta-learning approach to combine the computational methods for predicting hot spots</head><p>We use the computational methods above to predict whether contact residues are hot spot residues or not after alanine mutations in the three interfaces—2D1-1918HA1, 2D1-2007HA1 and 2D1-2009HA1. We use default parameters for the Robetta and KFC web servers and for the FoldX software. Since Robetta and FoldX estimate G, we are interested in those residues whose alanine mutation results in G ≥ 1 kcal/mol. After that, we apply a meta-learning approach (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Vilalta and Drissi, 2002</ref>) by combining the Z-score method with the other methods. The reason is that the Z-score method has a very high recall with low precision rate; however, the other methods generally have a low recall but a high precision rate. Therefore, in this work, we are interested in those hot spot residues that are predicted by Z-score and are also confirmed by at least one of the other methods (Robetta, FoldX or KFC). Meanwhile, we also trust with high confidence that non-hot spot residues predicted by Z-score generally have insignificant contribution to the binding. The hot spot residues which are predicted by a single method only are considered having intermediate contribution to binding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RESULTS</head><p>The sequence alignment among 1918HA1, 2007HA1 and 2009HA1 is shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1a</ref>. There are a total of six interfacial mutations between 1918HA1 and 2009HA1, namely E131D, T133N, S159N, V169I, N171D and T242K. The structural alignment of 1918HA1 and 2009HA1 between their interfacial segments is shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1c</ref>where the structural match—based on the Cαs of these interfacial residues—has an RMSD of 0.725 Å. Previous works have reported that protein sequences with ∼50% identity or above in crystallographic models can differ by ∼1 Å RMSD, while proteins in NMR models can have even larger deviations (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Chothia and Lesk, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Schwede et al., 2000</ref>). In some cases, sequences with &gt;95% identity can also have an interface RMSD up to ∼1.2 Å (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Kinjo and Nakamura, 2010</ref>). Thus, the small 0.725 Å RMSD suggests that the interfacial segments of the two HA1 proteins have a very good match. This indicates that the mutations from 1918HA1 to 2009HA1 resulted in little structural change at the binding site, and that thePage: 2531 2529–2536computationally produced binding structure of 2009HA1 and the 2D1 antibody may not have any big deviation from the real one.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Energy change tendency of the six mutations</head><p>Using the Z-score method, three of the six mutations—T133N, S159N and N171D—are predicted as non-hot spot residues in both 1918HA1 and 2009HA1. Two mutations—V169I and T242K—are believed to contribute, though slightly, to the antibody binding in 2009HA1 only after the mutations. They may be newly formed hot spots in the epitope of 2009HA1 after the mutations. The remaining one of the six mutations—E131D—is predicted to contribute to the binding free energy both before and after the mutation. Robetta, FoldX and KFC predict all the mutations as non-hot spot residues in both 1918HA1 and 2009HA1. However, G of V169I is predicted to increase from 0.4 to 0.76 kcal/mol by Robetta and from 0.07 to 0.83 kcal/mol by FoldX. Hence, the six mutations from 1918HA1 to 2009HA1 do not appear to adversely affect the binding between the 2D1 antibody and the two HA1s. Instead, on the whole, the change of binding free energy exhibits a possible increased tendency after the mutation, making the binding stronger. This is consistent with the result that the 1918HA1 neutralizing 2D1 antibody can cross-react with 2009HA1 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Xu et al., 2010</ref>). Geometrically, the six mutations are located at the rim of the binding interface (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1b</ref>and c), forming a part of an O-ring structure (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bogan and Thorn, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Li and Liu, 2009</ref>). Most of them have a large exposed portion to water and are not deeply buried. Their absolute and relative ASA information and burial levels are presented in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. Only the residue at position 131 is buried with little exposure to water. The influential O-ring theory (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bogan and Thorn, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Li and Liu, 2009</ref>) stated that residues on an O-ring, though of structural importance, are usually not energetically important. Therefore, these six mutations can only slightly destruct the antibody binding of 2009HA1 energetically if they are adverse. We closely examined the S159N mutation from 1918HA1 to 2009HA1. It was reported to have a high G ∼2 kcal/mol (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Xu et al., 2010</ref>). However, we believe that this residue does not contribute greatly to the antibody binding either before or after the mutation. First, Ser 159 has no significant contact with the antibody; see<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3a</ref>. Second, the S159N mutation makes the backbone deviate far away—the Cα deviation is ∼1.1 Å. This results from an increased flexibility for Asn 159 side chain. At the side chain of Ser 159 , OG has a hydrogen bond with its backbone O. The distance between O and OG is 2.2 Å, and the angle of OG-H···O is 151.0 @BULLET. Therefore, it is this hydrogen bond that confines Ser 159 side chain. But the mutation makes Asn 159 side chain free to contact water molecules, which can drag and affect the backbone structure a lot. Third, the mutation breaks the hydrogen bond of OG and the backbone O at Ser 159 , releasing some binding free energy. In fact, at least half of the 2 kcal/mol G of the mutation should come from this hydrogen bond break. This can be seen from the mutation Page: 2532 2529–2536<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Xu et al., 2010</ref>). For example, G158E/D, S160L or S165K cause only a small G (&lt;1 kcal/mol). These also happened between different residue-type groups, e.g. a mutation from a polar uncharged residue Ser 160 to a hydrophobic residue Leu 160. These suggest that these non-hot spot residues have little contribution to the binding to either 1918HA1 or 2009HA1, just as Z-score predicts. So, mutating these predicted non-hot spot residues provides little chance for H1N1 to evade capture by the 2D1 antibody.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Q.Liu et al.</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Hot spot residues at the epitopes of the two HA1s</head><p>The hot spot residues in 2D1-1918HA1 or 2D1-2009HA1 predicted by Robetta, FoldX, KFC and Z-score are shown in<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. All of them are considered to have potential contribution to the antibody Page: 2533 2529–2536<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>). Similar observation can be found for the remaining one (Lys 163 ) in 2D1-2009HA1. These residues all have a very small ASA, and are buried with a burial level up to 2.0 (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>). These doubleconfirmed hot spot residues are believed to contribute greatly to the antibody binding, as the combined prediction by Z-score and the other computational methods has a much higher precision. So, they are positions for mutations that can lead to H1N1's escape from 2D1's neutralization. Some of these double-confirmed hot spot residues at 2D11918HA1 or 2D1-2009HA1 are also supported by wet-lab experiments. For example, the mutation of Asn to Lys at position 129 and the mutation of Lys to Asn at position 163 in wet-lab experiments resulted in &gt;1 kcal/mol G (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Xu et al., 2010</ref>). This fact indicates that Asn 129 and Lys 163 are truly energetically important although the mutations are non-alanine mutations. Lys 166 has been comprehensively studied in the past by wet-lab experiments. It was found that this residue contributes greatly to this antibody binding: its mutations to residue types such as its similar hydrophilic residues Glu and Gln, or Pro resulted in &gt;3 kcal/mol G (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Xu et al., 2010</ref>). As can be seen in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>, Lys 166 is predicted by three computational methods (Z-score, Robetta and FoldX) as a hot spot residue in both 1918HA1 and 2009HA1 epitopes. To investigate why this residue is energetically so important, we examine its contacts using<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3b</ref>. First, this residue is deeply buried with a small ASA and high burial level. Second, Lys 166 has several hydrogen bonds with its NZ atom as the donor: one hydrogen bond forms with the backbone O of the Ser 126 from the same chain as Lys 166 , and the other two form with the side chain O of Asp 93 and of Asn 31 from the light chain of the antibody. Third, CE of Lys 166 has a π-involving contact with Trp 127 from the same chain as Lys 166. These contacts suggest that this residue contributes greatly to the antibody binding and to the antigen folding by the π-involving contact with Trp 127 and the hydrogen bond with the Ser 126. In fact, Ser 126 is also at the epitope site, and it is predicted as a hot spot residue by FoldX and Robetta in the 2009HA1 epitope site but as a non-hot spot residue in the 1918HA1 by all the methods; so this hydrogen bond contributes to the antibody binding indirectly. The residue Lys 166 was also reported as a selected escape mutation at 2D1-antibody by several viruses including 2009 H1N1, 1918 H1N1 and the 1930 swine viruses (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Krause et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Xu et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Yu et al., 2008</ref>). What is more interesting is that Lys 166 's two hydrogen bond contact residues, Asp 93 and Asn 31 , are all predicted to be hot spot residues by Z-score and more than one other methods, instantiating the hot spot coupling property (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Halperin et al., 2004</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Hot spot residues at 2D1's paratope</head><p>We also studied those residues in the paratope (the antigen binding site) of the 2D1 antibody that can contribute greatly to the binding. These antibody hot spot residues can uncover how the 2D1 antibody captures the H1N1 viruses. Using the Z-score method, all and only six hot spot residues are predicted in the antibody light chain which are also common between 2D1-1918HA1 and 2D1-2009HA1. Meanwhile, eight hot spot residues in the antibody heavy chain are identified in 2D11918HA1, and seven in 2D1-2009HA1. These predicted paratope hot spots are depicted in<ref type="figure">Figure 2d</ref>and e. Among them, five from the heavy chain and three from the light chain are confirmed by more than one existing computational methods (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>). In the antibody light chain, the hot spot residues Asp 93 and Asn 31 have significant contacts with the antigen hot spot residue Lys 166 as we discussed above. We believe that they are mainly responsible for the binding to the antigen. In the antibody heavy chain, we are interested in the predicted hot spot residue Arg 97 , as it is predicted to be energetically important by three methods in both 2D1-1918HA1 and 2D1-2009HA1 (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>).(d), the whole complex and the core interface are shown in surface view, and so the epitope and the paratope have no surface; 1918HA1, the antibody heavy chain and the antibody light chain are in cyan, green and brown, respectively.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Q.Liu et al.</head><p>Its close contact with Asp 52 is shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3c</ref>. Asp 52 is also from the antibody heavy chain and confirmed as a hot spot residue by Robetta and FoldX. As seen in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3c</ref>, Arg 97 has two hydrogen bonds with Asp 52 with NH1 and NH2 as donors and OD1 and OD2 as acceptors. Furthermore, Arg 97 's NH2 has a hydrogen bond with OD1 from Asp 53 , and Arg 97 's NH1 has another hydrogen bond with OD1 from the antigen residue Asn 129. Asn 129 is considered to contribute greatly to the antibody binding by the two existing methods (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>). These contacts form a hydrogen-bond network which is believed to generate a favorable electrostatic contribution to the protein binding that can strongly stabilize the protein complexes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Sheinerman and Honig, 2002</ref>). Another finding is that the side chain of Arg 97 confines at least three side chains: the side chain of Arg 97 which is positively electrically charged, and the side chains of Asp 52 and Asp 53 which are negatively charged. These side chains should prefer solvent water molecules if they are free. So, confining by the side chain of Arg 97 can make remarkable contribution to the antibody binding by removing the freedom of these three charged side chains. Our investigation also finds a large cavity at the core of the binding interface, as seen in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3c</ref>interface would have a larger open empty or solvent core. This makes it impossible to have stable binding. Hence, we believe that both Arg 97 and Asp 52 are energetically significant in the binding.<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Xu et al., 2010</ref>) as shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2c. 2007HA1</ref>contains another glycosylation site Asn 125 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Xu et al., 2010</ref>); see<ref type="figure">Figure 2c</ref>. To better understand the assumed binding, we use<ref type="figure">Figure 2f</ref>to depict the binding region of 2D1's paratope to the glycosylation sites, and this region covers two of the three predicted hot spot residues of the paratope. It can be observed that the glycosylation sites mask the surface of 2007HA1 to block the cross-neutralization by 2D1 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Xu et al., 2010</ref>). The computational methods did make some predictions of hot spots in 2D1-2007HA1, because none of them considers the potential glycosylation sites but only the residue information. In fact, these hot spot predictions are not true if the glycosylation sites are considered. In summary, 2D1 cannot recognize 2007HA1 for neutralization.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">CONCLUSION</head><p>We have done a structural analysis on the interfaces between the 2D1 antibody and the HA1 proteins of 2009 H1N1 and 1918 H1N1. The cross-neutralization of this antibody is clearly demonstrated by the hot spot residues common in the two binding interfaces. Our comprehensive investigation suggests that there are six outstanding epitope residues whose mutations will help H1N1 evade capture by this antibody. We further pinpointed the hot spot residues at the paratope site of the 2D1 antibody which are responsible for the antigen recognition. The understanding of these hot spot residues can potentially facilitate drug design to neutralize influenza viruses.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_4"><head></head><figDesc>The hot spot prediction results on the assumed artificial 2D12007HA1 interface are also presented in Tables 2, 3 and Figure 2c and f. We find that more than half of the predicted hot spots in the binding of 2D1-1918HA1 or 2D1-2009HA1 are not predicted to make contribution to the artificial binding 2D1-2007HA1, although Leu 156 is newly predicted as a hot spot residue at the epitope of 2D1-2007HA1. We have two interesting remarks about this assumed binding. One remark is about Lys 162 in 2007HA1 (Lys 166 in 1918HA1 and 2009HA1) which is predicted as a non-hot spot residue. First, this residue is conserved in the three HA1s. Second, it is predicted as a hot spot residue in 1918HA1 and 2009HA1 by all the computational methods here. Third, its binding importance in 2D1-1918HA1 and 2D1-2009HA1 has been demonstrated by Xu et al. (2010). So, the reduced contribution of this Lys in 2D1-2007HA1 indicates an escape of 2007HA1 from 2D1. This together with the less number of predicted hot spots in 2D1-2007HA1 suggests a very small occurrence probability of 2D1-2007HA1. The other remark is that although Asn 159 in 2007HA1 (Lys 163 in 1918HA1 and 2009HA1) is predicted to contribute to the artificial 2D1-2007HA1 binding, this mutation creates a potential N-glycosylation site (</figDesc></figure>

The structure information of the HA1 proteins of A/Brisbane/59/2007 (2007HA1) is taken from Igarashi et al. (2010). Our comparative analysis is on the three interfaces: the interface between 2D1 and 1918HA1 (2D1-1918HA1), the interface between 2D1 and 2009HA1 (2D1-2009HA1) and an assumed artificial interface between 2D1 and 2007HA1 (2D1-2007HA1). We use MAFFT to align the three HA1 sequences to examine the specific mutations among 1918HA1, 2009HA1 and 2007HA1.

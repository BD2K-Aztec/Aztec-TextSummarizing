				<p>The genomics era provides opportunities to assess the genetic overlap across phenotypes at the measured genotype level; however, current approaches require individual-level genome-wide association (GWA) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data in one or both of a pair of GWA samples. To facilitate the discovery of pleiotropic effects and examine genetic overlap across two phenotypes, I have developed a user-friendly web-based application called SECA to perform SNP effect concordance analysis using GWA summary results.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Epidemiological and clinical studies indicate many human complex disorders co-occur within an individual, whereas family and twin studies suggest correlations in familial and genetic liabilities. Since 2007, 41700 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed to identify common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), associated with 4890 phenotypes (disease endpoints or quantitative traits) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Hindorff et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">www. genome.gov/gwastudies, accessed September 18, 2013</ref>). A surprising finding of GWAS is that many loci show pleiotropic effects by being associated with more than one distinct phenotype. A study of 1380 genes and 1687 SNPs listed in the NHGRI Catalog of Published GWAS (www.genome.gov/gwastudies, accessed February 4, 2011) found 16.9% of genes and 4.6% of SNPs show pleiotropic effects (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Sivakumaran et al., 2011</ref>). Identifying and taking advantage of genetic overlap across phenotypes can improve detection of genetic risk factors because when risk is correlated across phenotypes, pooled analyses will be better powered than individual-disorder analyses. Genetic overlap can also help determine whether our current classification and categorization of diseases are valid or whether genetic similarities traverse current divisions. Understanding pleiotropic effects is also important for drug development. For example, if a gene has opposing effects on different common diseases, drug development and marketing will be greatly complicated. Knowledge of pleiotropic associations could help to predict and avoid adverse side effects. Polygenic prediction, or genetic risk score (GRS), analysis (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Purcell et al., 2009</ref>) and bivariate linear mixed model (bivariate-GCTA) analysis (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Lee et al., 2012</ref>) have recently been developed to assess the genetic overlap across phenotypes. GRS analysis requires GWAS summary results for a discovery sample (dataset1) to construct a score in an independent target sample (dataset2) by forming the weighted sum of associated alleles (i.e. a GRS) within each subject (thus requiring individual-level GWA SNP genotype data for the target sample). Association between the GRS and a phenotype in the target sample implies genetic overlap between the discovery and target phenotypes. The bivariate-GCTA approach requires individual-level population-based GWA SNP genotype data for both the discovery and target sample to estimate the genetic correlation explained by SNPs between pairs of quantitative traits or pairs of binary traits. For example, the SNP-based genetic correlation (r g SNP ) will be positive when the cases of one (discovery) trait show higher genetic similarity (i.e. pairwise genetic relationship estimated from genome-wide SNP genotype data) to the cases of the other (target) trait, than they do to their own (discovery) controls. The sharing of individual-level genotype and phenotype data requires application, material transfer agreement, informed consent and ethical consideration (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">McGuire et al., 2011</ref>). Given most large GWA studies meta-analyze summary results from multiple independent samples, the sharing of individual-level GWA SNP genotype data is often difficult, if not impossible. Therefore, to overcome these challenges, I have developed a user-friendly webbased application called SECA to perform SNP effect concordance analysis using GWAS summary results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">METHODS</head><p>SECA analyzes two sets of GWAS summary results (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig.  S1</ref>), each containing five essential columns: (i) reference SNP cluster 'rs' ID (SNP), (ii) effect allele (EA), (iii) non-effect allele (NEA), (iv) P-value from association test (P) and (v) regression coefficient (BETA), odds ratio (OR) or signed z-score (ZSCORE) for the EA relative to the NEA. SECA first aligns the SNP effects across the two GWAS summary results (dataset1 and dataset2) to the same EA, and extracts a subset of independent SNPs via linkage disequilibrium (LD) clumping using the PLINK program (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Purcell et al., 2007</ref>). The default clumping procedure is 'P-value informed'. The approach iterates from the first to last SNP on each chromosome sorted from smallest to largest P-value in dataset1 (P 1 ) that has not already been clumped (denoting this as the index SNP) and forms clumps of all other SNPs that are within 1 Mb and in LD (r 2 40.1) with the index SNP based on HapMap or 1000 Genomes Project (1 kGP) genotype data. A second round of LD clumping is performed to ensure none of the round 1 index SNPs within 10 Mb of each other are in longrange LD (r 2 40.1). The default approach identifies the subset of independent SNPs with the most significant association P-values in dataset1. An alternate LD clumping approach identifies an effectively random subset of independent SNPs by setting all dataset1 P-values (P 1 ) to 0.5 during the clumping rounds. Restricting to SNPs associated with P 1 {0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0} in dataset1, SECA first performs exact binomial statistical tests using the R statistical package (R Development Core Team, 2009) to determine whether there is an excess of SNPs associated in both datasets for the subset of SNPs associated with P 2 {0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0} in dataset2. For each of the 144 SNP subsets (generated using these 12 Â 12 P-value threshold combinations), binomial tests of associated SNPs in dataset1 (P 1 ) and dataset2 (P 2 ) are performed. A binomial test 'heatmap' plot is generated to graphically summarize the proportion of SNP subsets with an excess<ref type="bibr">[</ref>permuted ). We note that for polygenic traits, a well-powered GWAS should produce an excess of smaller P-values (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Yang et al., 2011</ref>). Therefore, instead of specifying P 2 as the expected proportion of SNPs with P 1 and P 2 , the proportion of SNPs associated in dataset2 (irrespective of its P-value in dataset1) is used as the 'overlap' (null) probability (i.e. 'expected proportion') in the binomial tests. For example, the observed proportion of total SNPs with P 1 1 and P 2 0.05 is used as the expected proportion of SNPs with P 1 {0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0} and P 2 0.05. SECA next performs Fisher's exact statistical tests to determine whether there is an excess of SNPs where the effect directions (BETA, OR or ZSCORE) are concordant across dataset1 and dataset2 for each of the 144 SNP subsets. Fisher's exact tests of SNP effects in dataset1 (e.g. OR 1 ) and dataset2 (OR 2 ) are performed on 2 Â 2 tables containing the number of SNPs with OR 1 51 (BETA 1 /ZSCORE 1 50) and OR 2 51,</p><formula>OR 1 ! 1 (BETA 1 /ZSCORE 1 ! 0)</formula><p>and OR 2 51, OR 1 51 and OR 2 ! 1 and OR 1 ! 1 and OR 2 ! 1. A Fisher's test 'heatmap' plot is generated to graphically summarize the proportion of SNP subsets with concordant (Fisher's test odds ratio, OR FT ! 1) and discordant (OR FT 51) SNP effects, and an empirical P-value (P FTsig-permuted ) is calculated via permutation for the observed number of subsets (n FTsig ) with nominally significant concordance (OR FT ! 1 and P FT 0.05). A permuted Pvalue is also estimated for the single most significant concordant test (P FTmin-permuted ). In addition to a summary of the above analyses, SECA reports detailed results from binomial and Fisher's tests for three practical subsets of SNPs, which are nominally associated (P 2 0.05) in dataset2 and (i) genome-wide significant (P 1 5 Â 10 À8 ), (ii) genome-wide suggestive (P 1 1 Â 10 À5 ) and (iii) nominally associated (P 1 0.05) in dataset1. A 'grid' search is also performed across 150 P-value thresholds to identify the subset of SNPs overlapping dataset1 and dataset2 that produce the minimum binomial test 'pleiotropic' P-value and minimum Fisher's test (effect concordance) P-value. The search is performed at 5 equidistant P-value {P 1 , P 2 } increments for the interval [5 Â 10 À8 ,</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><figDesc>observed (obs) ! expected (exp)] or deficit (obs5exp) number of associated SNPs, and empirical P-values (adjusted for testing all 144 subsets) are calculated via permutation. The permutation procedure first creates uncorrelated datasets by randomly shuffling the observed SNP effect (BETA) and corresponding P-value (P) between SNPs in dataset1, and then repeats the analysis of the 144 SNP subsets. A permuted P-value (P BTsig-permuted ) is estimated for the observed number of binomial tests with obs ! exp and P BT 0.05 (n BTsig ), and for the single most significant excess (P BTmin</figDesc></figure>

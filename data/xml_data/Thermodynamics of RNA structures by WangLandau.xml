				<p>Motivation: Thermodynamics-based dynamic programming RNA secondary structure algorithms have been of immense importance in molecular biology, where applications range from the detection of novel selenoproteins using expressed sequence tag (EST) data, to the determination of microRNA genes and their targets. Dynamic programming algorithms have been developed to compute the minimum free energy secondary structure and partition function of a given RNA sequence, the minimum free-energy and partition function for the hybridization of two RNA molecules, etc. However, the applicability of dynamic programming methods depends on disallowing certain types of interactions (pseudoknots, zigzags , etc.), as their inclusion renders structure prediction an nondeterministic polynomial time (NP)-complete problem. Nevertheless, such interactions have been observed in X-ray structures. Results: A non-Boltzmannian Monte Carlo algorithm was designed by Wang and Landau to estimate the density of states for complex systems, such as the Ising model, that exhibit a phase transition. In this article, we apply the Wang-Landau (WL) method to compute the density of states for secondary structures of a given RNA sequence, and for hybridizations of two RNA sequences. Our method is shown to be much faster than existent software, such as RNAsubopt. From density of states, we compute the partition function over all secondary structures and over all pseudoknot-free hybridizations. The advantage of the WL method is that by adding a function to evaluate the free energy of arbitary pseudoknotted structures and of arbitrary hybridizations, we can estimate thermodynamic parameters for situations known to be NP-complete. This extension to pseudoknots will be made in the sequel to this article; in contrast, the current article describes the WL algorithm applied to pseudoknot-free secondary structures and hybridizations.

Indeed, the genomic information of retroviruses, such as the hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency viruses, is encoded by RNA rather than DNA, while the peptidyl transferase reaction, arguably the most important enzymatic reaction responsible for life, is catalyzed not by a protein, but rather by RNA (<ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Weinger et al., 2004</ref>). It has recently emerged that RNA plays a wide range of previously unsuspected roles in many biological processes, including retranslation of the * To whom correspondence should be addressed. genetic code [selenocysteine insertion (<ref type="bibr">Böck et al., 1991</ref>), ribosomal frameshift (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bekaert et al., 2003)]</ref>, transcriptional and translational gene regulation (<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lim et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Mandal et al., 2003</ref>), temperaturesensitive conformational switches (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Chowdhury et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Tucker and Breaker, 2005</ref>), chemical modification of specific nucleotides in the ribosome (<ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Omer et al., 2000</ref>), regulation of alternative splicing (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cheah et al., 2007</ref>), etc. A secondary structure for a given RNA nucleotide sequence a 1 ,...,a n is a set S of base pairs (i,j), such that a i ,a j forms either a Watson–Crick or GU (wobble) base pair, and such that there are no base triples or pseudoknots in S. 1 For example, the secondary structure of Y RNA 2 with EMBL access code AAPY01489510/220-119 is displayed in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1a</ref>and b, while<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1c</ref>and d depicts the pseudoknotted structure of the Gag/pro ribosomal frameshift site of mouse mammary tumor virus (<ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Van Batenburg et al., 2001</ref>).

In contrast, by disallowing pseudoknots, secondary structure prediction is algorithmically tractable; there are dynamic programming algorithms to compute the minimum free-energy structure for a single RNA molecule, as well as for the hybridization of two or more RNA molecules. In particular, such methods can be loosely grouped into two types of algorithm— those that use (i) a stochastic context free grammar to compute a covariation model and (ii) free-energy parameters obtained from UV absorbance (optical melting) experiments, in order to determine the minimum free energy structure (i.e. thermodynamic-based algorithms). Examples of stochastic context-free grammars are the programs Infernal (<ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Nawrocki et al., 2009</ref>) and Pfold (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Knudsen and Hein et al., 2003</ref>). Examples of thermodynamics-based algorithms are the programs mfold (<ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Zuker and Stiegler, 1981</ref>), UNAFOLD (<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Markham and Zuker, 2008</ref>), RNAfold (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hofacker et al., 1994</ref>), RNAstructure (<ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Mathews et al., 2004</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2007</head><p>). Such thermodynamics-based algorithms are particularly important, since the tertiary structure of RNA is believed to be largely determined by secondary structure, which acts as a scaffold for tertiary contacts; see<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Banerjee et al. (1993)</ref>for experimental data supporting this view. 3 Computing the minimum free-energy pseudoknotted structure for a given RNA sequence is NP-complete<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lyngso and Pedersen (2000)</ref>for the Turner nearest neighbor energy model. 4 For that reason, pseudoknot structure prediction algorithms fall into three categories: (i) exponential time exact algorithms, (ii) dynamic programming algorithms that restrict pseudoknots to a particular class and (iii) heuristic methods. Examples of exact algorithms for pseudoknot structure prediction are the branch-andbound algorithm of (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bon, 2009</ref>) and the method using tree-width decomposition of<ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Zhao et al. (2008)</ref>. Examples of algorithms that consider only pseudoknots of a particular class are found in the pioneering work of Rivas and Eddy (1999) and<ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lefebvre (1995)</ref><ref type="bibr">et al. (1990)</ref>and a simple, yet elegant algorithm called ProbKnot (D.H. Mathews, to appear) that appears to be the state-of-the art method according to recent benchmarking studies. Finally, it is beyond the scope of this article to provide additional background on algorithms for RNA structural alignment, motif detection or tertiary structure prediction. As will be shown later, by Wang-Landau (WL) Monte Carlo methods, we can obtain essentially the same results as by dynamic programming computation of the partition function from UNAFOLD and RNAcofold; however, the advantage of the WL approach is that by extending the energy evaluation function for a given structure or hybridization, we can estimate the partition function for arbitrary pseudoknotted structures, known to be an NP-complete problem. Before proceeding, we formally define a secondary structure as follows. Given an RNA sequence s = a 1 ,...,a n , a secondary structure S on s is defined to be a set of ordered pairs corresponding to base pair positions, which satisfies the following requirements.</p><p>(1) Watson–Crick or GU wobble pairs: if (i,j) belongs to S, then pair (a i ,a j ) must be one of the following canonical base pairs:</p><formula>(A,U), (U,A), (G,C), (C,G), (G,U) and (U,G).</formula><p>(2) Threshold requirement: if (i,j) belongs to S, then j −i &gt;θ.</p><p>(3) Non-existence of pseudoknots: if (i,j) and (k,,) belong to S, then it is not the case that i &lt; k &lt; j &lt;&lt;.</p><p>(4) No base triples: if (i,j) and (i,k) belong to S, then j = k; if (i,j) and (k,j) belong to S, then i = k.</p><p>For steric reasons, following convention, the threshold θ, or minimum number of unpaired bases in a hairpin loop, is taken to be three. For any additional background on RNA and dynamic programming computation of secondary structures, see Clote and Backofen (2000) and the recent review Eddy (2004).</p></div>

(2006b)</ref>, as well as in protein structure prediction by the fragment assembly<ref type="bibr">Zhang et al. (2009)</ref>. In this article, we apply the WL algorithm to compute the density of states and partition function for RNA secondary structure as well as for the hybridization of two RNA sequences. We begin by validating and benchmarking the WL method against the exhaustive method RNAsubopt<ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Wuchty et al. (1999)</ref>, that enumerates all secondary structures of a given RNA sequence. Next, we compute the partition function over all secondary structures and over all pseudoknot-free hybridizations. We describe as well how to compute the partition function Z(T ) over all temperatures from 0 @BULLET C to 100 @BULLET C by performing two WL computations, followed by convolution calculations. Although the computation of the partition function over all secondary structures and over all pseudoknot-free hybridizations can be done using the existent software RNAfold (<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hofacker, 2003</ref>), respectively, RNAcofold (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bernhart et al., 2006</ref>), UNAFold (<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Markham and Zuker, 2008</ref>) and a recently published method of Chitsaz et al., the real advantage of our method is that by adding a function to evaluate arbitary pseudoknotted structures and arbitrary hybridizations, we can approximately compute the partition function, heat capacity, melting temperature, etc. for a context known to be NP-complete Lyngso and Pedersen (2000). The density of states is defined to be the absolute frequency function for energy; i.e. density of states g(e) counts the number of states having energy e. In the context of RNA secondary structure, a state is a secondary structure for an arbitrary but fixed RNA sequence s. In<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cupal et al. (1996)</ref>, described the first efficient algorithm, running in O(m 2 n 3 ) time, to compute the density of states for an RNA sequence of length n, where energy is discretized into m bins. The program of<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cupal et al. (1996)</ref>is no longer available, since it has been superceded by the program RNAsubopt, developed by<ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Wuchty et al. (1999)</ref>, which enumerates all secondary structures, whose free energy is within a user-defined bound above the minimum free energy. Though not documented, the RNAsubopt program additionally admits the option-D, which, instead of outputting structures, outputs only the number of secondary structures in each energy bin above the minimum free energy (bin size 0.1 kcal/mol).<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kirkpatrick et al., 1983</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">WL</head><p>The WL algorithm, (<ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Wang and Landau, 2001a</ref>, b) was designed in order to compute the density of states and partition function, neither of which can be computed directly by classical Monte Carlo methods, such as the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm, simulated annealing, replica exchange, etc. Recall the definition of Markov chain. Let Q ={1,...,n} be a finite set of states, let π = (p 1 ,...,p n ) be the distribution for initial state, and let P = (p i,j ) be a matrix of transition probabilities, satisfying j p i,j = 1 for all i. A (first-order, time-homogeneous) Markov chain M = (Q,π,P) is a stochastic process, whose state q t at time t is a random variable determined by</p><formula>Pr[q 0 = i] = π i , Pr[q t+1 = j|q t = i] = p i,j .</formula><formula>Define p i (t) = Pr[q t = i] and p (t) i,j = Pr[q t = j|q 0 = i]. Clearly, the (i,j)-th entry of the t-th power P t of P equals p (t)</formula><p>i,j ; moreover, by time-homogeneity it follows that p</p><formula>(t) i,j = Pr[q t 0 +t = j|q t 0 = i]</formula><p>, for all t 0. The stationary probability of state i is defined by lim t p i (t) = p * i , provided the limit exists. It is a classical result that every finite, aperiodic, irreducible Markov chain has an equilibrium distribution of stationary probabilities; see the text of Clote and Backofen (2000) for a new, self-contained proof of this result. A Markov chain with state set Q and stationary probabilities p * 1 ,...,p * n is reversible, if for all i,<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>presents pseudocode for the classical Metropolis–Hastings Monte Carlo algorithm with simulated annealing (<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kirkpatrick et al., 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Metropolis et al., 1953</ref>), which implements a random walk on the Markov chain whose transition probabilities p i,j of moving from state x i to x j is given by</p><formula>j ∈ Q, p * i p i,j = p * j p j,i .</formula><formula>p i,j = P(x i → x j ) = min 1, exp(−E(x j )/RT )/Z exp(−E(x i )/RT )/Z · N (x j ) N (x i ) = min 1, exp( −(E(x j )−E(x i )) RT ) N (x i ) .</formula><formula>(1)</formula><p>where N (x i ) is the set of immediate neighbors of state x i and N (x j ) the set of immediate neighbors of state x j ; i.e. N (x i ) is the set of states that can bereached by a single move from state x i. It can be proved that the stationary probabilities for this Markov chain are given by the Boltzmann probabilities</p><formula>p * i = e −E(i)/RT Z</formula><p>, as shown in Clote and Backofen (2000). In contrast,<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>presents pseudocode for the WL algorithm, which implements a random walk on the Markov chain whose transition probabilities p i,j of moving from state x i to x j are given by</p><formula>p i,j = P(x i → x j ) = 1 N (x i ) ·min g(E(x i )) g(E(x j )) ,1 = P(e i → e j ) = 1 N (x i ) ·min g(e i ) g(e j ) ,1 .</formula><formula>(2)</formula><p>In this case, the stationary probability of state x i is are given by</p><formula>g(E(x i )) E .</formula><p>The mathematical–justification for applying the Metropolis-Hastings Monte Carlo method (<ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Metropolis et al., 1953</ref>) to determine the minimum energy conformation of a biopolymer (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bradley et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Das and Baker, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Ortiz et al., 1998</ref>) depends on two facts: (i) every finite, irreducible, aperiodic Markov chain has a stationary probability distribution and (ii) if the Markov chain is reversible, a situation called detailed balance by the physics community, then the stationary distribution of the Markov chain corresponding to the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm is the Boltzmann distribution, defined by P(</p><formula>x) = exp(−E(x)/RT Z , where E(x)</formula><p>is the energy of state (i.e. conformation) x, R is the universal gas constant 1.986 cal/mol, T is absolute temperature, and the partition function Z is defined by x exp(−E(x)/RT , where the sum is taken over all states x in the Markov chain. As temperature T approaches zero, the Boltzmann probability of the minimum energy state approaches 1, in the case of a unique minimum energy state, or more generally 1/m, in the case of m distinct minimum energy states. See<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Clote and Backofen (2000)</ref>for details. In contrast to the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm, which performs a random walk on the Markov chain of states (secondary structures), the WL algorithm performs a random walk on the energy space of the Markov chain of states (secondary structures), where the stationary probability of visiting energy e i is proportional to 1 g(e i ) , then the histogram of energies encountered in the random walk will be flat. In this article, we consider the Markov chain, whose states are the secondary structures of a given RNA sequence, and for which permissible local moves correspond to the addition or removal of a single base pair (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Flamm et al., 2000</ref>). Although detailed balance holds for the Metropolis– Hastings algorithm in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, it does not necessarily hold for the Metropolis algorithm, obtained by replacing line</p><formula>11. if (z &lt; e −E(y)/RT /N x e −E(x)/RT /N y ) then x = y by 11. if (z &lt; e −E(y)/RT e −E(x)/RT ) then x = y</formula><p>Indeed for the case of RNA secondary structures, detailed balance does not hold in this situation, since if we define the stationary probability p * i</p><p>for state x i to be the Boltzmann probability</p><formula>p * i = exp(−E(x i )/RT Z</formula><p>, and the transition probabilities given by Equation (1), then it is not always the case that</p><formula>p * i ·p i,j = p * j ·p j,i .</formula><p>For instance, the empty structure S =. .. .. .. .. . on the 10-mer GGGGGCCCCC has 18 immediate neighbors, one of which is T = (. .. .. . ). The structure T has 11 immediate neighbors, one of which is the empty structure S. Letting x i = S and x j = T , we have E(x i ) = 0 kcal/mol, E(x j ) = 2.70 kcal/mol, ensemble free energy is −RTln(ZSummarizing, in the Metropolis algorithm (with modified line 11), reversibility of a Markov chain depends on the permissible local moves, while in the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm (with line 11 as in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>), reversibility is always ensured. In the case at hand, if every secondary structure is an immediate neighbor of every secondary structure, then in the Metropolis algorithm, transition probabilities would be p i,j = P(x i → x j ) = min 1, exp(−E(x j )/RT )/Z N ·exp(−E(x i )/RT )/Z</p><formula>= min 1, exp( −(E(x j )−E(x i )) RT ) N ,</formula><formula>(3)</formula><p>where N is the number of secondary structures. In this case, an easy computation shows that the Markov chain is reversible. Despite the nonreversible nature of the Markov chain corresponding to the Metropolis algorithm, whose states are the secondary structures of a given RNA sequence, and whose local moves consist of the addition or removal of a single base pair, it has been a standard practice to apply the Metropolis algorithm in this case (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Danilova et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Flamm et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Isambert and Siggia, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Xayaphoummine et al., 2005</ref>). For that reason, we do not hesitate to apply the WL algorithm for the study of RNA secondary structure formation. Note that in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>, the WL computes the relative density of states, defined by g(i) = N(e i )/N, where N(e i ) is the number of states having energy e i and N is the total number of states. In the case of RNA secondary structures, it is simple to compute the total number of secondary structures by dynamic programming, given as follows. Given an RNA sequence of length n, let BP i,j = 1 if positions i,j can form a Watson–Crick or wobble pair, otherwise let BP i,j = 0. Let θ = 3 denote the minimum number of unpaired bases in a hairpin loop. Letting N i,j denote the number of secondary structures on subsequence<ref type="bibr">[i,j]</ref>of the given RNA sequence, we have that N i,j = 0 if j &lt; i+3, and otherwiseIt follows that the total number of secondary structures is then N 1,n. From the relative density of states computed by WL algorithm, we compute the absolute density of states by</p><formula>N i,j = N i,j−1 + j−θ−1 k=i BP k,j ·N i,k−1 ·N k+1,j−1 .</formula></div>

By this method, one can approximate the partition function Z(T ) for all temperatures from 0 @BULLET C to 100 @BULLET C, by performing two WL sampling runs, respectively, at temperatures −373 @BULLET C and 37 @BULLET C, and then to repeatedly perform a fast convolution. The method just described, which involves two WL computations, together with convolution computations, has until now not worked well in practice, for certain technical reasons. This direction needs further exploration. Another issue concerning any sampling method is the required time to obtain reasonably good estimates of the quantity in question. In the case of RNA kinetics, computations of MFPT to reach the minimum free-energy structure take inordinate amounts of time, when using Metropolis–Hastings Monte Carlo methods, which are time-driven simulations. For this reason, the program KinFold (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Flamm et al., 2001</ref>) uses an event-driven simulation, where time is incremented by an exponentially distributed random variable. It may be possible to use similar ideas to increase efficiency of our WL program, which should further improve the accuracy in the computation of heat capacity. Finally, we intend to implement a new energy evaluation function, that allows arbitrary pseudoknots, zig-zags, etc. using energy parameters from the recent dissertation of Bon (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bon, 2009</ref>). This will allow us to estimate the partition function, ensemble free energy, heat capacity, melting temperature, etc. for a context known to be NP-complete.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this article, we have implemented the WL algorithm to compute the relative density of states for RNA secondary structures and hybridizations. Separately computing the number of structures and hybridizations, we obtain the absolute density of states, which then yields the partition function, and thence, in the case of hybridization, the melting temperature. The WL method is much faster than existent software RNAsubopt in computing the density of states, but could not be benchmarked with the binning method of<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cupal et al. (1996)</ref>which runs in O(m 2 n 3 ) time, for length n sequence and m energy bins, since the latter software is no longer available, being superceded by RNAsubopt-D. In preliminary tests, we obtain roughly the same melting temperature for duplex RNA, as that computed by existent methods; however, the real advantage of the WL method is that there is no restriction on types of allowed interaction, unlike the situation with dynamic programming approaches that disallow pseudoknots, zig-zags, etc.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig.1.</head><figDesc>Fig. 1.

(2005) a similar time-driven Monte Carlo simulation program, KineFold, is described to compute kinetically determine pseudoknotted structure for a given RNA sequence. Danilova et al. (2006) describe the RNAkinetics web server used to study the kinetics of the folding transitions of a growing RNA molecule, as in the case of transcriptional folding. We now begin by providing background definitions and describing the WL algorithm.</note>

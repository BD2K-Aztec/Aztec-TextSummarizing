				<p>Motivation: Species tree estimation in the presence of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) is a major challenge for phylogenomic analysis. Although many methods have been developed for this problem, little is understood about the relative performance of these methods when estimated gene trees are poorly estimated, owing to inadequate phylogenetic signal. Results: We explored the performance of some methods for estimating species trees from multiple markers on simulated datasets in which gene trees differed from the species tree owing to ILS. We included *BEAST, concatenated analysis and several &apos;summary methods&apos;: BUCKy, MP-EST, minimize deep coalescence, matrix representation with parsimony and the greedy consensus. We found that *BEAST and concatenation gave excellent results, often with substantially improved accuracy over the other methods. We observed that *BEAST&apos;s accuracy is largely due to its ability to co-estimate the gene trees and species tree. However, *BEAST is computationally intensive, making it challenging to run on datasets with 100 or more genes or with more than 20 taxa. We propose a new approach to species tree estimation in which the genes are partitioned into sets, and the species tree is estimated from the resultant &apos;supergenes&apos;. We show that this technique improves the scalability of *BEAST without affecting its accuracy and improves the accuracy of the summary methods. Thus, naive binning can improve phylogenomic analysis in the presence of ILS.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Species tree estimation from multiple genes is often performed using concatenation (also called 'combined analysis'): alignments are estimated for each gene and concatenated into a supermatrix, which is then used to estimate the species tree. When gene trees are concordant, concatenation can give accurate results; however, this approach to species tree estimation is potentially problematic when gene trees differ from the species tree (and hence from each other) owing to several biological factors, including gene duplication and loss, horizontal gene transfer and incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). The best studied of these problems is species tree estimation in the presence of ILS, which is based on the multi-species coalescent (<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Wakeley, 2009</ref>). Many methods have been developed to estimate species trees in the presence of ILS, beginning with the minimize deep coalescence (MDC) approach suggested in<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Maddison (1997)</ref>, and now including many different types of methods [see Degnan and Rosenberg (2009);<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Knowles (2009)</ref>for a discussion of some methods]. Some of these new methods [for example, MP-EST (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Liu et al., 2010</ref>) and the population tree from BUCKy (<ref type="bibr">Aneét al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Larget et al., 2010</ref>)] have been proven to be statistically consistent in the presence of ILS. In contrast, the greedy consensus (GC), majority consensus, the concordance tree from BUCKy and MDC (<ref type="bibr">Aneét al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Degnan et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Than and Rosenberg, 2011</ref>) can be inconsistent in the presence of ILS (i.e. there are some parameter settings under which these methods are inconsistent). The Bayesian method *BEAST (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Heled and Drummond, 2010</ref>) may produce a statistically consistent point estimate (e.g. the MAP tree) of the species tree, but a formal proof has not yet been provided<ref type="bibr">[however, see Steel (2010)</ref>, which proves the statistical consistency of gene tree estimation using Bayesian MCMC methods]. Simulations suggest that when true gene trees differ owing to ILS, concatenated analysis can produce incorrect estimates of the species tree, sometimes with high confidence (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">DeGiorgio and Degnan, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Edwards et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Kubatko and Degnan, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Larget et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Leacheánd Rannala, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Liu et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Salichos and Rokas, 2013</ref>), leading to the conjecture that concatenated analyses are not statistically consistent. However, statistical consistency or inconsistency is a mathematical statement about performance in the limit and so requires a formal proof. Thus, while the evidence strongly suggests that, under conditions in which gene trees can differ owing to ILS, concatenation can be statistically inconsistent but *BEAST will be statistically consistent, these are still open questions. As a result of these studies and the growing awareness that ILS can be present in many phylogenomic datasets, there is great interest in using ILS-based estimation of species trees instead of concatenated analysis (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Degnan and Rosenberg, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Edwards, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Huang et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Knowles, 2009</ref>). However, only a few studies have been published comparing ILS-based methods and even fewer have compared concatenated analyses to ILS-based methods. Performance in simulation has been mixed, with ILS-based methods outperforming concatenation in some cases but not all (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">DeGiorgio and Degnan, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Edwards et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Heled and Drummond, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Leacheánd Rannala, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Liu et al., 2010</ref>). The performance of ILS-based methods on biological datasets has also been mixed, with concatenation often producing trees with high bootstrap support that may not be completely correct, but ILS-based methods often producing trees with low bootstrap support (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Meredith et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Song et al., 2012</ref>). Thus, we still do not know much *To whom correspondence should be addressed. about the relative performance of ILS-based methods, how they compare with methods (such as concatenation) that do not take ILS into account and what factors impact the absolute and relative performance of methods. In this article, we report on a simulation study to evaluate a collection of methods for estimating species trees and gene trees in the presence of ILS. Our simulation study includes datasets generated under three model conditions from prior studies (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chung and Ane´,Ane´, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Yu et al., 2011b</ref>). One model condition has 17-taxon datasets that evolve under a strong molecular clock, and the other two model conditions have 11-taxon datasets that do not evolve under a clock. The amount of ILS varies between the three model conditions, ranging from relatively low amounts to high amounts. Finally, estimated gene trees on these datasets have low average bootstrap support due to insufficient phylogenetic signal, reflecting conditions often encountered when sampling genes from throughout the genome. We study a wide range of methods for estimating species trees from multiple markers, including *BEAST (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Heled and Drummond, 2010</ref>), both the population and concordance trees returned by BUCKy (<ref type="bibr">Aneét al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Larget et al., 2010</ref>), MP-EST (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Liu et al., 2010</ref>), Phylonet-MDC (<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Than et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Yu et al., 2011a</ref>), GC (also called the extended majority consensus), matrix representation with parsimony (MRP) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baum and Ragan, 2004</ref>) and concatenation using maximum likelihood (CA-ML). Our study revealed that many methods have poor accuracy when the individual gene sequence alignments have low phylogenetic signal. This vulnerability to poor signal affects all methods, but especially those that combine estimated gene trees; by comparison, *BEAST and CA-ML are relatively less impacted. We developed an approach to address the vulnerability of species tree methods to low phylogenetic signal. We randomly partitioned the genes into subsets (which we call 'supergenes'), estimated trees from these supergene alignments and then used methods to estimate the species tree from the supergene trees. This approach did not produce statistically significant changes in accuracy on the 17-taxon datasets, but improved the accuracy of the trees estimated by combining estimated gene trees, often substantially, on the 11-taxon datasets. Running *BEAST on the binned supergene alignments did not impact its accuracy, but did improve its scalability. Furthermore, when used with binning, several methods came close to being as accurate as *BEAST, while being orders of magnitude faster than *BEAST. Thus, this study suggests that highly accurate largescale phylogenomic analyses may be achievable through a naive binning technique.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Datasets</head><p>We used simulated 11-taxon (Chung and Ane´,Ane´, 2011) and 17-taxon (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Yu et al., 2011a</ref>, b) multi-gene datasets. The 11-taxon datasets have 100 genes, and the 17-taxon datasets have 32 genes. The protocols used in the two studies were fairly similar; however, the 11-taxon datasets reflect more heterogeneity, and hence are less idealized than the 17-taxon datasets. In each case, a model species tree was generated and a set of gene trees within each species tree (with one haploid individual sampled per species) produced under a coalescent process. This produces gene trees that can differ topologically from their associated species tree owing to ILS. DNA sequences were then simulated down each gene tree under the Jukes-Cantor model. Hundred replicates were generated for each model condition, and each replicate consisted of a set of true sequence alignments (i.e. one alignment for each gene). The 11-taxon and 17-taxon datasets differ in some regards. First, the 17-taxon datasets evolved under a molecular clock, but the 11-taxon datasets did not. Second, the 11-taxon datasets have short sequences (only 500 nucleotides), but the 17-taxon datasets have long sequences (2000 nucleotides). In the 11-taxon model conditions, there is substantial rate variation between the gene trees and species tree, but this is not true for the 17-taxon model conditions. Finally, the model conditions also varied in the amount of ILS, as we now discuss. We calculated two statistics to evaluate the level of ILS in each model condition: the 'average clade distance' between the true species tree and the true gene trees and the percentage of the true gene trees that have the same topology as the true species tree. The clade distance between two rooted trees (i.e. the rooted analog of the bipartition distance) is the total number of unique non-trivial clades (in one tree but not in both) divided by 2n À 4. Thus, if two rooted trees on seven leaves share exactly two clades in common, the clade distance is 60%. Using this metric, the 17-taxon datasets have the highest amount of ILS (average clade distance 25.7%). The 11-taxon datasets came in two forms, one with somewhat lower (but still high) amounts of ILS (average clade distance 14.8%), and one with low amounts of ILS (average clade distance 2.9%). We refer to the two 11-taxon models as strongILS and weakILS, accordingly. The percent of gene trees that match the species tree also fits with this relative ranking: 73.1% for the 11-taxon weakILS datasets, 21.3% for the 11-taxon strongILS datasets and only 1.7% for the 17-taxon datasets. Thus, the 17-taxon datasets have extremely high levels of ILS, but the 11-taxon strongILS also have a high level of ILS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">Selecting subsets of genes</head><p>For the 17-taxon datasets, we used the provided 8-gene and 32-gene datasets; for the 11-taxon datasets, we sampled from the 100 genes to produce subsets with the desired number of genes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Gene tree estimation</head><p>We compared *BEAST, RAxML v. 7.3.1 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Stamatakis, 2006</ref>) and FastTree-2 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Price et al., 2010</ref>), as gene tree estimators. We used 20 runs of RAxML on each of the alignments, and retained the tree with the best ML score; for FastTree-2, we used it with only one run (because it is deterministic, it is not improved by multiple runs). For *BEAST, we ran it as described below. We used RAxML with 400 bootstrap replicates for BUCKy and for Phylonet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Species tree methods</head><p>We include *BEAST, MP-EST, BUCKy-pop, BUCKy-con, CA-ML, the GC, Phylonet-MDC and MRP; see below for details. With the exception of *BEAST and CA-ML, these methods estimate the species tree by combining estimated gene trees; we refer to these as 'summary methods'. For MP-EST, MRP and GC, we use the binary gene trees as input [these methods either require binary gene trees or have not been shown to improve by contracting low support branches (<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Yang and Warnow, 2011)]</ref>. We used *BEAST v. 1.6.2 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Heled and Drummond, 2010</ref>) in its default setting, and used the default point estimates for the gene trees and species tree. For a given *BEAST analysis, we discarded the first 10% of the trees returned by the analysis, and then sampled one out of each 1000 of the remaining trees. We ran *BEAST long enough to return ESS values that were large enough to suggest possible convergence. Even after 150 h of analysis, the ESS statistics for *BEAST on the 11-taxon 100-gene strongILS datasets were poor, suggesting that *BEAST had not converged; therefore, we omit results of *BEAST for these datasets. We used MP-EST (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Liu et al., 2010</ref>) in its default setting, using MAXROUND ¼ 100 000, and with RAxML gene trees rooted at the provided outgroup. We used BUCKy (Aneét al., 2007) with the default setting to compute two species tree estimations—the population tree (BUCKy-pop) and the concordance tree (BUCKy-con). We computed gene tree distributions using RAxML with bootstrapping and also using *BEAST as input to BUCKy. On each model condition and number of genes, we ran BUCKy using a sufficiently large number of MCMC iterations to reach sufficiently low standard deviations for the concordance factors to suggest possible convergence. We used Phylonet v. 2.4 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Than et al., 2008</ref>) for a version of the NPhard MDC problem that takes gene tree branch support values into consideration. Although MDC is not statistically consistent (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Than and Rosenberg, 2011</ref>), Phylonet-MDC can produce highly accurate species trees (Yang and<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Warnow, 2011</ref>) when applied to gene trees in which all the low support branches are collapsed. Phylonet provides a technique to solve this version of MDC exactly, even for unrooted gene trees (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bayzid and Warnow, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Yu et al., 2011a</ref>, b), which can be used on datasets with a small enough number of taxa; we used this exact method for MDC for the 11-taxon datasets, and Phylonet's heuristic method (which restricts the solution space to those trees all of whose bipartitions come from the input set of trees) for the 17-taxon datasets. We used Phylonet on the ML gene trees with all branches having bootstrap support 575% collapsed. We used PAUP* to estimate MRP, using the standard heuristic search, and also to compute a GC (also called the 'extended majority consensus') of the estimated gene trees. Both of these analyses are performed on the binary gene trees estimated by maximum likelihood. We also studied CA-ML, using RAxML to infer a species trees from the superalignment (without partitioning), and using 10 independent runs (ÀN 10).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Criteria</head><p>We report tree error using the missing branch rate (also known as the FN or 'false negative' rate), which is the proportion of internal branches in the true tree defining bipartitions that are missing in the estimated tree. The use of FN rates rather than Robinson–Foulds rates is owing to the observation that some of the methods for estimating trees produce unresolved trees, and the Robinson–Foulds rates would be biased in favor of these methods (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Rannala et al., 1998</ref>). We tested for statistical significance using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Experiments</head><p>The first experiment compared the 'fast' methods (all methods except *BEAST and BUCKy) on 100 replicates of the 11-taxon and 17-taxon datasets, varying the number of genes, using RAxML to estimate gene trees. The second experiment compared the full set of methods on 20 replicates of these model conditions, again using RAxML to estimate gene trees. We explored the accuracy of gene trees estimated by RAxML, FastTree and *BEAST in the third experiment. The fourth experiment evaluated the accuracy of species trees computed for gene trees estimated by *BEAST. The fifth experiment then examined the impact of binning genes into supergenes, using a simple 'naive' binning technique.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RESULTS</head><p>We show results evaluating computational aspects of the different methods, and then results of the five basic experiments exploring accuracy. See the Supplementary Materials for additional details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Computational issues</head><p>The phylogenomic pipelines we studied differed dramatically in terms of their running times, making some methods infeasible to use on some datasets within the limits of this study. Due to space limitations, we present a brief discussion of the computational requirements of the different methods, and direct the interested reader to the Supplementary Materials for full results. Pipelines that used *BEAST took the most time, with running times of 80–150 h for the 50-gene datasets with 11 taxa; analyses of the 100-gene datasets with 11 taxa did not converge, even in 150 h. The pipelines with BUCKy, when used with distributions computed using RAxML bootstrapping, took up to 5 h, but were able to be run on even the 100-gene 11-taxon datasets. Pipelines with Phylonet when used with the RAxML bootstrap trees (restricted to the high support edges) took up to 2 h per dataset (almost all of that for running RAxML). Pipelines with MRP, GC and CA-ML took just a few minutes per dataset. Because of these computational issues, we only ran BEAST on unbinned datasets with at most 50 genes (and even these were computationally intensive). We also did not run *BEAST or unbinned BUCKy on more than 20 replicates for any model condition. Therefore, in the remaining study, we show results for the 'fast' methods (everything but *BEAST and BUCKy) on 100 replicates of the model conditions, and we examine *BEAST and BUCKy on only 20 replicates of the model conditions. We do, however, show results using BUCKy with binning on 100 replicates of some model conditions. In total, we estimate that we used at least 5000 CPU h, just for the *BEAST runs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Experiment 1</head><p>The first experiment explored the accuracy of the 'fast' methods for estimating species trees, i.e. CA-ML, MP-EST, MRP, Phylonet and GC;<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figures 1</ref>–3. CA-ML had the best accuracy, with large improvements over other methods on the 11-taxon datasets and small improvements on the 17-taxon datasets. All the improvements are statistically significant: P50:003 for the 11-taxon strongILS with up to 100 genes and the 11-taxon weakILS with up to 25 genes, and P 0:04 for the 17-taxon datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Experiment 2</head><p>We then evaluated BUCKy-pop, MP-EST, *BEAST, CA-ML and BUCKy-con. Because *BEAST is computationally intensive, the analyses were limited to 20 replicates per datapoint. See<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures 4</ref>–6. Note that *BEAST and CA-ML are the two most accurate methods on these data, with the greatest improvement over the other methods on the 11-taxon weakILS datasets and the least improvement on the 17-taxon datasets. The relative performance between CA-ML and *BEAST varied, with CA-ML better in some cases and worse in others, and often the difference was small. BUCKy-pop is in third place, and even matched the accuracy of *BEAST on the 11-taxon strongILS datasets with 25 genes. A comparison between BUCKy-pop and BUCKy-con shows that they had close accuracy in most cases, but that BUCKy-pop was sometimes more accurate than BUCKy-con (e.g. on the 11-taxon strongILS datasets with 25 or 50 genes), with statistically significant differences (P ¼ 0:003 and P ¼ 0:035, respectively). Of these various observations, the most important here are the following: CA-ML and *BEAST had the best accuracy on these data; the gap between methods was least on the 17-taxon datasets, and greatest on the 11-taxon weakILS datasets; and all methods became less accurate with increases in the amount of ILS. It is easy to understand why the methods that are not statistically consistent under ILS increase in error with the degree of ILS, but not that easy to understand why *BEAST, MP-EST and BUCKy-pop decrease in accuracy with increases in ILS. Here we offer a possible explanation for this trend. Recall that the conditions that favor ILS are short branches in the species tree. Thus, the conditions that increase the amount of ILS (i.e. short branches) also make it challenging to estimate the gene trees. In fact, the weakILS model trees have long branches<ref type="bibr">[</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3">Experiments 3 and 4</head><p>The next two experiments attempted to understand why *BEAST was so much more accurate than the summary methods. In Experiment 3, we evaluated the accuracy of the gene trees estimated by *BEAST, FastTree-2 and RAxML for all three model conditions, and observed that *BEAST produces substantially more accurate gene trees than FastTree-2 and RAxML. For example, under the 11-taxon weakILS model condition with 50 genes, gene trees estimated by *BEAST had only 3.3% error while gene trees estimated by RAxML had 31.9% error—a reduction of $90%. More generally, the greatest improvement was for the model condition with the lowest rate of ILS (11-taxon weakILS), and the least improvement was for the model condition with the highest rate of ILS (17-taxon datasets). However, even on the 17-taxon datasets, the reduction was at least 50%. Results for the 17-taxon datasets are given in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7</ref>; see the Supplementary Materials for the other results. These analyses also show that RAxML has a small but statistically significant advantage over FastTree (differences in missing branch rate of at most 1.7% on the 11-taxon weakILS conditions, 2.5% on the 11-taxon strongILS conditions and 1.1% on the 17-taxon conditions). In Experiment 4 (Supplementary Materials), we examine the results of using the summary methods (i.e. BUCKy-con, BUCKy-pop, Phylo-MDC, MP-EST, MRP and GC) on inputs of gene trees estimated by *BEAST. These experiments show that species trees estimated by combining gene trees estimated by *BEAST are essentially as accurate as the species trees estimated by *BEAST, and there are no statistically significant differences. This suggests that the accuracy obtained by *BEAST is primarily owing to its improved gene tree accuracy, rather than to some sophisticated way of combining accurate gene trees.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.4">Experiment 5</head><p>Because reduced phylogenetic signal in individual gene sequence alignments impacts the summary methods, we considered the following approach:</p><p>Step 1: Partition the genes into bins.</p><p>Step 2: Within each bin, compute a 'supergene' alignment, by concatenating the alignments for the genes in the bin.</p><p>Step 3: Compute a 'supergene tree' using ML on each supergene alignment.</p><p>Step 4: Estimate the species tree from the set of supergene trees (using one of the 'summary' methods), or from the set of supergene alignments (using *BEAST, for example). Because this binning technique can put genes into the same bin that may not share the same history, this approach is a blend of CA-ML and the species tree estimation technique used in Step 4. Our motivation for this approach is empirical. The hope is that because each supergene has more sites, ML trees estimated on each supergene might be more resolved than ML trees estimated on the individual genes. If the genes placed in the same bin have the same gene tree topology, then this approach could potentially lead to higher accuracy gene trees. If the genes placed in the same bin have different gene tree topologies, then they may not represent any gene tree that appears in the dataset, but may be closer to the species tree. In either case, summary methods applied to these supergene trees might be more accurate than summary methods applied to the individual gene trees.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Evaluating binning on fast methods</head><p>In our initial experiment, we explored the impact of binning on the fast methods on 100 replicate datasets of each model condition. We used bins with five genes each for the 11-taxon datasets, and bins with four genes each for the 17-taxon datasets. We do not present results for *BEAST (unbinned or binned) or BUCKy on unbinned datasets owing to computational issues; however, we do show results for BUCKy on binned datasets. Note also that because we ran CA-ML without partitioning, binning has no impact on CA-ML. Results for the 11-taxon strongILS datasets are shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figures 8</ref>–10. See the Supplementary Materials for results on the 11-taxon weakILS datasets and 17-taxon 32-gene datasets. Binning improved accuracy for all methods for the 11-taxon datasets (both weakILS and strongILS), but not always statistically significantly. Results on the 17-taxon datasets showed that binning did not have any statistically significant impact on any method (P40:22). On the 11-taxon weakILS datasets with 25 genes, all methods improved in accuracy. These improvements were statistically significant for MP-EST and Phylonet (P ¼ 0:002 and P ¼ 0:016, respectively), but not for the other summary methods. However, all methods were already highly accurate without binning. Binning produced large reductions in error for many methods on the 11-taxon strongILS datasets with 25 genes. PhylonetMDC showed the largest improvement (reduction from 12.6 to 9.6%, P ¼ 0:002), MP-EST showed the second-largest improvement (reduction from 11.0 to 8.8%, P ¼ 0:021) and GC and MRP showed the least improvement (reductions of at least1%, but not statistically significant, P ¼ 0:16 and P ¼ 0:18, respectively). On 50 genes, all methods had reductions in error, with Phylonet-MDC showing the largest improvement (reduction from 8.9 to 4.1%, P510 À5 ), GC showing the next largest improvement (reduction from 9.6 to 5.4%, P510 À4 ), MRP the next largest improvement (reduction from 9.1 to 5.3%, P510 À4 ) and MP-EST with the smallest improvement (reduction from 7.3 to 5.7%, but not statistically significant, P ¼ 0:057). On 100 genes, all methods had reductions in error, and again Phylonet-MDC had the largest improvement (reduction from 5.4 to 2.4%, P510 À3 ), GC had the next largest (reduction from 5.4 to 3.4%, P ¼ 0:007) and MRP and MP-EST showing smaller improvements that were not statistically significant (P40:07). Thus, binning improved the accuracy of all methods on the 11-taxon model conditions, with large reductions for the strongILS conditions and smaller (but still significant) reductions on the weakILS conditions. The greatest improvements were for intermediate numbers of genes, in which the methods used without binning still had some error (and hence could be improved), but had enough genes so that binning produced a reasonable number of supergenes. Binning had no statistically significant impact on the 17-taxon model conditions with 100 replicates (P40:22). CA-ML was still the most accurate of all tested methods, but some methods came close to the accuracy of CA-ML when used with binning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Evaluating binning on all methods</head><p>Owing to the computational effort in using *BEAST, we limited the analysis to only 20 replicates of each model condition. We limit this discussion to the impact of binning on *BEAST and BUCKy because the analysis on 100 replicate datasets allowed us to evaluate binning on the other methods with a higher number of replicates. Results on the 11-taxon weakILS datasets with 25 genes are shown in the Supplementary Materials; all methods improved, but the improvement was statistically significant only for BUCKy-pop (reduction from 3.1 to 0.0%, P ¼ 0:03). Results on the 20-replicate 17-taxon datasets (Supplementary Materials) show no statistically significant differences (P40:3) for BUCKy-pop, BUCKy-con and *BEAST, and all differences were small (at most 0.5%). Results on 11-taxon strongILS datasets are shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figures 11</ref>and 12. BUCKy-pop generally improved with binning, but the results were not statistically significant (P40:06). BUCKy-con also improved using binning (reduction in error from 14.3 to 9.4% on 25 genes, from 12.5 to 5% on 50 genes and from 5.6 to 2.5% on 100 genes), and the changes on 25 and 50 genes were statistically significant (P ¼ 0:018 and P ¼ 0:005, respectively). The impact of binning on *BEAST is interesting. On the 100-gene datasets, we were unable to run *BEAST to convergence without binning even with 150 h of analysis; however, *BEAST was able to reach acceptable ESS values in only 10 h using four threads when run on 20 bins with five genes each. Thus, the use of binning did not impact the accuracy of</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DISCUSSION</head><p>The main purpose of this study was to evaluate methods for estimating species trees in the presence of ILS under realistic conditions. Because many real-world phylogenomic analyses have to contend with genes with poor phylogenetic signal (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Salichos and Rokas, 2013</ref>), we specifically examined conditions in which estimated gene trees were only partially resolved. As expected, the number of genes and amount of ILS impacted the accuracy of the methods we tested, so that all methods returned more accurate trees with increasing numbers of genes and decreasing levels of ILS. However, in addition to these expected results, we make the following observations: First, all the summary methods we studied were impacted by gene tree estimation error. In contrast, although *BEAST and CA-ML were also affected by the amount of phylogenetic signal in the multiple sequence alignments, the impact was generally less. Second, CA-ML and *BEAST had similar accuracy, and were generally more accurate than the summary methods we tested. Third, *BEAST produced dramatically more accurate gene trees than ML analyses on the alignments, and summary methods on these gene trees produced species trees as accurate as *BEAST species trees, explaining why *BEAST produces more accurate species trees than other methods. Fourth, the naive binning technique we tested generally improved coalescent-based methods. It improved the scalability of *BEAST without impacting its accuracy, making it feasible to use *BEAST on datasets with many genes. Binning also improved the accuracy of species trees estimated using the summary methods we tested on the 11-taxon conditions, although the degree of impact depended on the number of genes and the level of ILS. Finally, binning had no statistically significant impact on the 17-taxon conditions. The observation that summary methods are vulnerable to poor phylogenetic signal in the gene sequences is consistent with the empirical studies reported by Salichos and Rokas (2013) and<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Meredith et al. (2011)</ref>, and this study would seem to suggest that naive binning would be helpful for species tree estimation under these circumstances. However, naive binning could have unforeseen negative consequences if it puts genes with different histories into the same bin. The good performance of naive binning under the 11-taxon strongILS condition we explored suggests that it may be somewhat robust in practice, even under relatively high rates of ILS. However, because naive binning did not improve the accuracy of summary methods on the 17-taxon datasets (which had the highest rate of ILS), this suggests that naive binning could reduce accuracy when the amount of ILS is large. There is also a possibility that binning will only be helpful when concatenation is more accurate than the coalescent-based methods. Therefore, further research is needed to assess the conditions in which binning improves or reduces accuracy. See Supplementary Materials, Section 4, for additional discussion about this issue. One of the most interesting results in this article is the observation that CA-ML outperformed all the ILS-based methods that operate by combining estimated gene trees. This observation would seem to run counter to other simulation studies that have shown that concatenation can return incorrect trees with high confidence and can also produce trees that are less accurate than trees estimated by ILS-based methods (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">DeGiorgio and Degnan, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Edwards et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Heled and Drummond, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Larget et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Leacheánd Rannala, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Liu et al., 2010</ref>). However, these studies used simulated datasets that evolve under a strong molecular clock [a condition that may benefit some coalescent-based methods more than concatenation (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">DeGiorgio and Degnan, 2010)]</ref>, few taxa and generally had many genes relative to the number of taxa (and estimated gene trees on these alignments may have been fairly accurate). In contrast, our study had 11-and 17-taxon datasets, at most 100 genes and poorly estimated gene trees. Thus, it seems that there are conditions under which some ILS-based methods might outperform CA-ML, and other conditions under which CA-ML might outperform the ILS-based methods. In particular, it is possiblethat the critical issue is the number of genes, and that ILS-based methods will have better accuracy than concatenation when the number of genes is large enough. Clearly, further research is needed to understand which conditions favor each type of approach. See Section 4 in Supplementary Materials for more discussion of these issues.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><figDesc>and are called 'LB' in Chung and Ane´(Ane´(2011)], and the</figDesc></figure>

Therefore, it's not at all surprising that species trees estimated by combining gene trees under the highILS model conditions would have higher error than species trees estimated by combining gene trees under the lowILS model condition. Finally, the 17-taxon datasets had the highest level of ILS, and on these data the summary methods perform the worst. Note that this vulnerability applies to all summary methods, even to the statistically consistent methods like MP-EST and BUCKy-pop.</figDesc><table></table></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="5"> CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK Under the conditions of our experiments (at least 11 taxa, at most 100 genes and low signal per gene sequence alignment), we observed relatively poor species tree estimations using standard summary methods, and more accurate results from concatenation or from *BEAST, a method that co-estimates gene trees and species trees. However, the current co-estimation methods (including *BEAST) are computationally intensive and may not be feasible for use with more than 100 genes or more than 20 species. This study showed that a simple binning technique was able to make dramatic improvements in scalability for *BEAST, and generally improve the accuracy of summary methods, thus making some of these methods nearly as accurate as *BEAST. This study should not be interpreted as recommending the use of naive binning, but instead as an indication of the potential for binning techniques to improve species tree estimation. For example, statistical techniques could be used to estimate whether a set of genes is likely to have a common tree, so that bins would only include genes expected to have a common history. Also, while concatenation performed well in this study, we conjecture that new techniques designed to handle markers with limited phylogenetic signal, might outperform concatenation even under these model conditions. Whether these new techniques will use binning, or other ways of working with poorly estimated gene trees, the potential for substantial advances in species tree estimation could be great.</note>

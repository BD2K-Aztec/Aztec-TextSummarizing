				<p>GMD (generalized minimum distance of distributions) is an R package to assess the similarity between spatial distributions of read-based sequencing data such as ChIP-seq and RNA-seq. GMD calculates the optimal distance between pairs of normalized signal distributions, optionally sliding one distribution over the other to &apos;align&apos; the distributions. GMD also provides graphical and downstream clustering tools. Availability: The R package GMD source code is available at http:// cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GMD/ under GPL license Contact:</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>High-throughput DNA sequencers are now a cornerstone in genomics and can be used for inferring expression, splicing and non-coding isoforms (RNA-seq), transcription start sites (TSSs) (CAGE), transcription factor binding sites, chromatin status (ChIPseq) and more. Aside from typical tasks of read mapping/aligning to a reference or de novo assembling, differential expression, counting and peak calling, variant and mutation calling, comparing the distributions of DNA reads between different genomic loci or between different biological features (e.g. histone modifications) is also often meaningful. This is because the spatial distributions of such reads often indicate biological features; for example, ChIPseq experiments targeting H3K4me3 histone modifications often aggregate in characteristic double peaks around TSSs, while the H3K36me3 mark increase from TSS to termination site (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Barski et al., 2007</ref>). Similar examples exist for TSS (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Carninci et al., 2006</ref>) and small RNA data (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Valen et al., 2011</ref>). To do this systematically, a measure of similarity between distributions is necessary. Such measures should ideally be true metrics, have as few parameters as possible, be computationally efficient and also make biological sense to end-users. Here, we present such a measure, generalized minimum distance of distributions (GMD), based on MDPA (minimum difference of pair assignment,<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cha and Srihari, 2002</ref>). It can compare two empirical distributions of categorical data, which we refer as histograms (Supplementary Material). Considering two normalized histograms * To whom correspondence should be addressed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A</head><p>and B, GMD measures their similarity by counting the necessary 'shifts' of elements between the bins that have to be performed to transform distribution A into distribution B. Both GMD and MDPA have been implemented in C to interface with R for computational efficiency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">ALGORITHM</head><p>The heart of GMD is the comparison of two histograms, typically originating from counting DNA reads from biological experiments (e.g. ChIP) mapped to two limited genomic regions, which have been normalized so that they sum to 1. The measuring of GMD of two normalized ordinal type histograms A and B is formulated into a process we call gmd, with an option sliding, indicating whether the optimal alignment should be searched for partial alignment.</p><formula>(a)</formula><p>(b)<ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. The process gmd and its building block mdpa. The gmd process complements the mdpa by sliding and padding relevant distributions with zero counts and finding the optimal alignment, where Z(n) denotes a zero vector of length n. (a) the process mdpa for MDPA, where O and T denote two ordinal type histograms, with equal size of bins and equal overall mass. (b) the process gmd (with the option sliding on) for GMD, where A and B denote two normalized ordinal type histograms, with bin size b 1 and b 2 , respectively, (b 1 ≤ b 2 ). This algorithm runs in O(b) or O(b 2 ) with sliding off or on respectively, where b is the size of the distributions. (see Supplementary Material for details)</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">CONCLUSION</head><p>The GMD metric differs from common distance measurements (e.g. Euclidean norm, KL divergence) since the bins in the histogram will not be treated as independent and the similarity between non-overlapping bins is taken into account (discussed in<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cha and Srihari, 2002</ref>) and partial alignment is allowed. This makes sense in many applications when we have little knowledge about bin-to-bin correspondence between distributions. The GMD package together with its vignette and manual makes systematic studies comparing distributions possible with limited R knowledge.</p></div>

			<abstract>
				<p>tqDist is a software package for computing the triplet and quartet distances between general rooted or unrooted trees, respectively. The program is based on algorithms with running time Oðn log nÞ for the triplet distance calculation and Oðd Á n log nÞ for the quartet distance calculation, where n is the number of leaves in the trees and d is the degree of the tree with minimum degree. These are currently the fastest algorithms both in theory and in practice. Availability and implementation: tqDist can be installed on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. Doing this will install a set of command-line tools together with a Python module and an R package for scripting in Python or R. The software package is freely available under the GNU LGPL licence at http://birc.au.dk/software/tqDist.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Using trees to represent evolutionary relationships is a widespread technique in many scientific fields, in particular in biology, where trees are used to represent relationships between species or between genes in a gene family (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Semple and Steel, 2003</ref>). But trees are also used, for example, in linguistics, where trees may be used to describe the evolution of related languages (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Gray et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Walker et al., 2012</ref>), and in archaeology, where trees have been used to represent how copies of ancient manuscripts have changed over time (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Buneman, 1971</ref>). A common goal in all of these fields is to reconstruct the true tree from observed data. However, depending on both the available data and the reconstruction method, the inferred trees may differ. In such cases, tree distances are often used as a formal way to quantify the differences and to determine whether two trees are more similar than would be expected by chance. The triplet distance [introduced as the triples distance in<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Critchlow et al., (1996)</ref>] and quartet distance (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Estabrook et al., 1985</ref>) enumerate all subsets of leaves of size three and four, respectively, and count how often the topologies induced by the three or four leaves agree in the two trees. The triplet distance is intended for rooted trees, where the triplet topology is the smallest informative subtree (for unrooted trees all subtrees with three leaves have the same topology), whereas the quartet distance is intended for unrooted trees, where the quartet topology is the smallest informative subtree. The fastest known algorithms for computing the triplet and quartet distances have time complexity Oðn log nÞ for both distances on binary trees with n leaves and complexity Oðn log nÞ for the triplet distance and Oðd Á n log nÞ for the quartet distance on general trees, where d is the minimum degree of the two trees, and the degree of a tree is the maximum degree of a node in the tree (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Brodal et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Holt et al., 2014</ref>). In this applications note, we present an efficient and easy-to-use implementation of these algorithms and show that this is the fastest implementation available for computing the triplet and quartet distances. A detailed description of the algorithms and their implementation is given in<ref type="bibr">Brodal</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">ALGORITHM</head><p>In this section, we briefly describe the triplet distance algorithm. The quartet distance algorithm is somewhat more involved, but it also builds on the ideas presented here. For general trees, a triplet can be either resolved (the induced topology of the triplet is a binary tree) or unresolved (the induced topology is a trifurcation). Thus, given a triplet and two trees, T 1 and T 2 , the triplet can be resolved in both trees, unresolved in both trees or resolved in one and unresolved in the other. If it is resolved in both trees, the induced topologies may agree or disagree in the two trees. In the unresolved–unresolved case they always agree, and in the resolved–unresolved case they always disagree. For binary trees, the induced topologies are always resolved. Our algorithm computes the number of triplet topology differences implicitly by computing the number of shared triplet topologies and subtracting it from the total number of triplets,</p><formula>n 3 .</formula><p>The number of shared triplet topologies can, according to the classification above, be computed as the number of triplets that are unresolved in both trees plus the number of triplets that are both resolved and induce the same topology in both trees. The first of these numbers can be computed innumber of triplets that are resolved and induce the same topology in both trees, we associate every triplet to a unique node in T 1 and then, in a recursive traversal of T 1 , count how many of the triplets associated with each node in T 1 induce the same topology in T 2. Using the smaller-half trick to traverse T 1 and a balanced binary tree data structure called a hierarchical decomposition tree to count in T 2 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Brodal et al., 2013</ref>), this is done in Oðn log nÞ time. Hence, in total our algorithm runs in Oðn log nÞ time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">IMPLEMENTATION</head><p>tqDist is an implementation of the algorithm described above together with the corresponding quartet distance algorithm. The software package is carefully implemented in Cþþ, and interfaces for scripting in Python (via the module pyTQDist) and in R (via the package rtqdist) are also provided. The software package can be installed easily using precompiled installers or using CMake on Windows, OS X and Linux, and the source is furthermore freely available for installation on any platform supporting CMake, make and any standard Cþþ compiler. The software package includes four executables: triplet_ distance, quartet_distance, pairs_triplet_dis tance and pairs_quartet_distance. The first two both take two files, each containing a single tree in the Newick format, as input and outputs the distance between the two trees. The last two executables take two files, each containing the same number of trees in the Newick format, as input and outputs a list of numbers where the ith number is the distance between the two trees on line i in the two files. Similar functions (tripletDistance, quartetDistance, pairsTripletDistance and pairsQuartetDistance) are provided in pyTQDist and rtqdist. The following short code snippet shows how the python module may be used: from pyTQDist import * td ¼ tripletDistance("tree1.new", "tree2.new") print "triplet distance:", td ptd ¼ pairsTripletDistance("trees.new") print "list of distances:", ptd<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Mailund and Pedersen, 2004</ref>). It is evident that our new implementation is fastest for almost all practical purposes, being up to 80 times faster for binary trees with up to 10 000 species and up to 25 times faster for trees with degree d ¼ 128 and up to 10 000 species.</p></div>

				<p>Multiple spaced seeds represent the current state-of-the-art for similarity search in bioinformatics, with applications in various areas such as sequence alignment, read mapping, oligonucleotide design, etc. We present SpEED, a software program that computes highly sensitive multiple spaced seeds. SpEED can be several orders of magnitude faster and computes better seeds than the existing leading software programs. Availability: The source code of SpEED is freely available at</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Approximate string searching is at the core of many fundamental algorithms in bioinformatics. Since the quadratic-time dynamic programming algorithm of Smith–Waterman is too slow, heuristic methods have to be used. The most popular of those is implemented in BLAST (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Altschul et al., 1990</ref>) and uses the hit-and-extend approach: 11 consecutive matches are considered a hit and the neighborhood is investigated further for potentially local similarity. Such a match is called a seed. It has been noticed by<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Califano and Rigoutsos (1993)</ref>that requiring the matches to be non-consecutive increases the chance of finding similarities, and<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ma et al. (2002)</ref>introduced the idea of optimal spaced seeds, that is, seeds where the matches are distributed so as to maximize the sensitivity (i.e. probability to find a local similarity). Multiple spaced seeds (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Li et al., 2004</ref>) go much further and approach perfect sensitivity. Since then multiple spaced seeds have been used in many software programs in a variety of applications, such as sequence alignment (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Li et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ma et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Noe and Kucherov, 2005</ref>) read mapping (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">David et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Homer et al., 2009</ref>), oligonucleotide design (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Feng and Tillier, 2007</ref>), to name a few. It is therefore very important to compute seeds with very high sensitivity. The relevant problems are hard (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ma and Li, 2007</ref>) and all heuristic algorithms for computing seeds require exponential time with the exception of the one of Ilie and Ilie (2007). Our goal in this note is to engineer this algorithm into an efficient software for computing multiple spaced seeds. The new program, SpEED, has two execution modes, fast and best. We have compared SpEED with the two leading software programs, Mandala (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Buhler et al., 2005</ref>) * To whom correspondence should be addressed.and Iedera (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Kucherov et al., 2006</ref>) for a variety of seeds used in practice. SpEED-best computes always the best seeds with SpEEDfast coming often in the second place, whereas SpEED-fast is three to five orders of magnitude faster than all the other ones.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">METHODS</head><p>A spaced seed s is a string over the alphabet {1, * }, where 1 is a match and * a don't care. The number of 1's in s is called the weight of s. A multiple spaced seed is a set of seeds S ={s 1 ,s 2 ,...,s k }. In the Bernoulli model (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Li et al., 2004</ref>), an alignment is represented as a (random) sequence R of 1's and 0's (matches and mismatches) where the probability p of a match is called similarity. The length of R will be denoted by N. A seed s hits R if aligning s with R at some position causes each 1 in s to be aligned with a 1 in R. A multiple seed S hits R if there exist s ∈ S so that s hits R. The sensitivity of S is the probability that S hits R. It depends on S, p, and N. A dynamic programming (exponential) algorithm is given by<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Li et al. (2004)</ref>that computes the sensitivity of a given (multiple) seed. Finding optimal seeds by exhaustive search is feasible only for single seeds. The only polynomial-time heuristic algorithm (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ilie and Ilie, 2007</ref>) uses overlap complexity, a polynomial-time computable measure which is very well correlated with sensitivity. To avoid testing all possible seeds, the algorithm successively improves a fixed starting seed based solely on overlap complexity. The algorithm of Ilie and Ilie (2007) has the drawback of requiring the lengths of the seeds as input parameters. We have addressed this issue in SpEED by computing a number of good length sets and then interpolating those in order to produce good lengths for a wide range of parameters. To make the preprocessing feasible, we have developed an algorithm that computes all seed lengths from the minimum and maximum ones. (See Supplementary Material for details.) These values for k = 10 are shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. SpEED-first is the multiple seed computed using these lengths. SpEED-best is the most sensitive seed obtained after a number of restarts with random lengths and seeds between the given min and max.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RESULTS</head><p>We have compared SpEED with the two leading software programs, Mandala (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Buhler et al., 2005</ref>) and Iedera (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Kucherov et al., 2006</ref>)Seeds were computed by Mandala, Iedera and SpEED (fast and best) with the same parameters as those of SHRiMP, PatternHunter II and BFAST. The number of iterations was: 100 000 for Iedera and 10 for Mandala (both according to the authors' instructions) and 5000 for SpEED-best. The maximum time allowed for all programs was 1 day; we give the times until the best seed was obtained.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>L.Ilie et al.</head><p>for computing seeds with some of the most challenging parameters used in practice: SHRiMP (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">David et al., 2011</ref>), PatternHunterII (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Li et al., 2004</ref>) and BFAST (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Homer et al., 2009</ref>).<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>gives the sensitivities, all of which were computed using the algorithm of<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Li et al. (2004)</ref>. SpEED-best is the best in all cases considered with SpEED-fast coming often in second place. SpEED-first (times in bold) is three to five orders of magnitude faster than all the others, since it is polynomial-time. The improvement of the original seeds is significant. (A 1% improvement in sensitivity implies that, for 100x coverage of the human genome, an additional 3 billion nucleotides could be mapped by using the better seed.) An experimental evaluation of the SpEED seeds is given in<ref type="figure">Table 2</ref>by comparison with the optimal for three cases, where the parameters have been chosen such that exhaustive search is feasible and thesensitivities are in the low 80 s to maximize the difference to the optimal. The SpEED-best sensitivities are very close or even the same as the optimal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH</head><p>SpEED-first is suitable for on-the-fly computation of seeds, whereas SpEED-best computes the best seeds, apparently very close to the optimal. Further development includes modifying the overlap complexity so that seeds of different lengths can be compared as well as addressing models different than Bernoulli, such as Markov.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig.1.</head><figDesc>Fig. 1.

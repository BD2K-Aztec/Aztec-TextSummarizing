				<p>With the development of next-generation sequencing and genotyping approaches, large single nucleotide polymorphism haplotype datasets are becoming available in a growing number of both model and non-model species. Identifying genomic regions with unexpectedly high local haplotype homozygosity relatively to neutral expectation represents a powerful strategy to ascertain candidate genes responding to natural or artificial selection. To facilitate genome-wide scans of selection based on the analysis of long-range haplotypes, we developed the R package rehh. It provides a versatile tool to detect the footprints of recent or ongoing selection with several graphical functions that help visual interpretation of the results. Availability and implementation: Stable version is available from CRAN: http://cran.r-project.org/. Development version is available from the R-forge repository: http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/rehh. Both versions can be installed directly from R. Function documentation and example data files are provided within the package and a tutorial is available as Supplementary Material. rehh is distributed under the GNU General Public Licence (GPL ≥ 2).</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>In a pioneering work, (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Sabeti et al., 2002</ref>) investigated the genetic footprints of recent positive selection in humans by analyzing longrange haplotypes at several candidate genes using a novel measure called the extended haplotype homozygosity (EHH). EHH is defined as the probability that two randomly chosen chromosomes carrying the same allele at a focal SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) are identical by descent over a given distance surrounding it. If the core allele is under selection, then the EHH is expected to be close to one over a large distance upstream and downstream the focal SNP. However, testing the departure of EHH from neutral expectation remains difficult without making strong assumptions about the population demographic history.<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Voight et al. (2006)</ref>therefore proposed an empirical test based on the integral of the observed decay of EHH, which they defined as integrated EHH (iHH). They further defined a test statistic (iHS) as the log-ratio</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">DESCRIPTION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Input Data</head><p>rehh requires a SNP information file (SNP name, map positions and ancestral and derived alleles) and a genotype data file (with phased haplotypes) for each population(s) of interest. For this latter, rehh accepts two input formats (see the rehh tutorial), including fastphase (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Scheet and Stephens, 2006</ref>) output files. The data2haplohh() function imports the data into an object of class haplohh.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Analyses</head><p>At a given focal SNP, the calc_ehh() function computes the EHH statistics at both alleles for all neighbouring SNPs, as well as the corresponding iHH statistics. Likewise, the calc_ehhs() function computes the EHHS at a given focal SNP for allneighbouring SNPs and the resulting iES. Both the calc_ehh() and the calc_ehhs() functions provide optional plots of the results, which depict, respectively, the decay of the EHH and that of the EHHS from the focal SNP. The scan_hh() function allows computing iHH statistics for both alleles and the iES for all the SNPs present in the chromosome under study. For efficiency, the computation of EHH-based statistics was encoded in C and wrapper functions have been developed to interface the resulting compiled code in R. As a result, scanning the example dataset consisting in 140 individuals genotyped at 1424 SNPs with the scan_hh() function only takes 3.3 s on a standard PC running with a 3.2 GHz processor. The scan_hh() function may therefore be used to analyze efficiently large SNP datasets. In order to perform genome-wide scans, we recommend to analyze each chromosome in turn using the scan_hh() function, and then to concatenate the resulting matrices of iHH and iES (see the rehh tutorial). The ihh2ihs() and ies2rsb() functions can then be used to compute the standardized statistics. Some options are available to fiddle the standardization in these two functions. To that end, departure from normality of the standardized score distributions can be visually inspected using the distribplot() function. Both the ihh2ihs() and ies2rsb() functions provide optional plots of the results, which depict, respectively, the ordered values of iHS and Rsb along the genome. Last, the bifurcation.diagram() function draws haplotype bifurcation diagrams (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Sabeti et al., 2002</ref>), which allow visualizing the breakdown of linkage disequilibrium at increasing distances from the focal core allele.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>illustrates the results obtained using a previously published dataset (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Gautier and Naves, 2011</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1A</ref>shows the outputs of the iHS scan within the CGU population using the ihh2ihs() function. In particular,<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1A</ref>suggests a footprint of selection on chromosome 12 (BTA12), around position 28.99 Mb. This signal is even more striking when the Rsb scores, computed between the CGU and EUT haplotypes using the ies2rsb() function, are examined (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1B</ref>).<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1C</ref>, which is an output of the calc_ehh() function, shows a smaller decay of EHH for the ancestral allele than the derived allele for the focal SNP located at the iHS peak position 28.99 Mb. This trend is also apparent from the decay of EHHS depicted in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1D</ref>, which was obtained using the calc_ehhs() function. Finally,<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1E</ref>and F shows the bifurcation diagrams, which were obtained by running the bifurcation.diagram() function for both the ancestral and the derived core alleles at this same focal SNP. This graphical representation allows visualizing the breakdown of linkage disequilibrium on core haplotypes. The thickness of the lines is proportional to the frequency of each haplotype, which therefore informs on haplotype diversity. Comparing<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1E</ref>and F suggests that the favourable variant is associated with the SNP derived allele. Interestingly, this position is &lt;10 kb upstream of the RXFP2 gene on BTA12 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Gautier and Naves, 2011</ref>). Note that BTA12 SNP map positions and the 280 CGU haplotypes are provided as example datasets in the rehh package.</p></div>

			<note place="foot">* To whom correspondence should be addressed. of iHH computed at the derived and the ancestral focal SNP alleles. The iHS is standardized using the average and standard deviation values over all SNPs with similar allele frequencies. Because such within-populations measures have low power when the frequency of the selected allele is high, Tang et al. (2007) developed a similar procedure to compare the EHH profiles between populations. Their approach consists in computing for each SNP in each population a weighted average of the EHH at both alleles, referred to as sitespecific EHH (EHHS). The observed distribution of the standardized log-ratio of the integrated EHHS (iES) between pairs of populations (referred to as Rsb) are then used to detect signals of positive selection, i.e. genomic regions with unusually high Rsb. EHH-based tests were proved remarkably efficient to identify relevant footprints of recent selection in humans (Tang et al., 2007; Voight et al., 2006) and other species (e.g. Gautier and Naves, 2011). Although the sweep software (Sabeti et al., 2002) provides utilities to compute and visualize the decay of EHH, to our knowledge, however, no software package is available to compute all these statistics from large-scale datasets. To facilitate genome-wide scans for footprints of selection using EHH-based tests we, therefore, developed the package rehh for the statistical software package R (R Development Core Team, 2008). R is becoming a standard for the analysis of genetic data, and R packages are portable to most operating systems (Windows, Mac OS X and Linux). We briefly present in the following the main functionalities of the rehh package using data from a recently published study on cattle breeds (Gautier and Naves, 2011). Methods and functionalities implemented in the rehh package are described in more details in a tutorial available as online Supplementary Material.</note>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Single particle tracking (SPT) has become an essential tool to characterize movement in live cell imaging experiments (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Meijering et al., 2012</ref>). Typical applications span the dynamics of single molecules within the cell membrane (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Weigel et al., 2011</ref>), cell migration (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Suraneni et al., 2012</ref>) and intracellular trafficking (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Akita et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Mazzaferri et al., 2013</ref>). SPT methods extract the individual trajectories of objects registered in time-lapse images and provide information about both their individual and collective behavior. Although several studies track objects manually, the big leap for exploiting this technique has been brought by automatic multipletracking algorithms, because they can process large number of objects simultaneously (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Kalaidzidis, 2009</ref>). The vast majority of the implementations separate particle detection, i.e. the identification and location of particles in each image of the time series, from tracking. The latter assigns particle positions that result from detection, to individual trajectories. The simplest tracking approach, often named nearest neighbors, is based on minimizing the distance travelled globally by all particles. That is, object locations that are close enough in space and time are assigned to the same trajectory. However, the sole criterion of proximity is not enough under challenging experimental conditions. Tracking densely packed objects, and particles that merge, split or blink, requires additional information to uncover the real underlying tracks. In recent years, several methods have been proposed to address several of these shortcomings, which have been reviewed in detail (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Kalaidzidis, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Meijering et al., 2012</ref>). Typically, these methods employ sophisticated image processing and statistical tools, as well as a priori knowledge about the systems, to overcome clutter, noisy detection and eventual particle disappearance. The downside of methods that assume specific dynamical models is that they can bias the tracking results if they are used early onsystems where the dynamics is still unknown (Supplementary Note S5). In such cases a more secure procedure is to start the analysis with a conceptually simple tracking approach, such as the nearestneighbor algorithm. Regardless of how complex the method, its performance relies invariably on tuning accurately a set of parameters, which depend on the experimental details of the system (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chenouard et al., 2014</ref>). If the features of the system fluctuate spatially it is unlikely that a unique set of parameters are optimal across the entire image. Systems such as, neutrophil migration assays, intracellular trafficking of vesicles, particles diffusing in media with heterogeneous viscosity, and tracking of receptors unevenly distributed on the cell membrane are examples where this problem is particularly important (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Manley et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Valentine et al., 2001</ref>). Typically, this is partially addressed by limiting the analysis to small regions of interest, where conditions are approximately homogeneous. However, if trajectories are long, this workaround cuts tracks and biases the description of the system's dynamics. In this work, we propose a new SPT method for inhomogeneous systems that adapts automatically to the local density of particles, based on the popular nearest-neighbor tracking algorithm. One of the most cited and used nearest-neighbor algorithms was proposed by Crocker and Grier (C&amp;G) 1996), and has a simple code and free open source implementations in IDL, Matlab, Phyton and ImageJ (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bricard et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Lund and Wustner, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Manley et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Theves et al., 2013</ref>). Despite its simplicity, a method based on this algorithm (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Celler et al., 2013</ref>) has shown to render a good performance in a recent study that makes a widespread and quantitative comparison of SPT techniques (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chenouard et al., 2014</ref>). Nearest-neighbor algorithms minimize the global displacement of the particles, and thus need to consider all possible combinations of particle positions from one frame to the following, which can be computationally too expensive. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce a parameter called maximum displacement (mD), which represents the largest distance that a particle can move from one frame to the next one, to discard unlikely bonds and reduce the computation time. If this parameter is not carefully adjusted according to particles' speed and their density, either the trajectories are interrupted or the computation time is prohibitive. Therefore, in systems where particle density is inhomogeneous, there is no global value of mD that can be optimal everywhere. The method we propose is especially well suited for this kind of problem. We perform a systematic analysis of the problem, based on numerical simulations, as well as a thorough comparison of the proposed method with the standard nearest-neighbor algorithm. We finally demonstrate the advantage of applying the adaptive method to the classic underagarose neutrophils migration assay (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Nelson et al., 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Sackmann et al., 2012</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Tracking algorithm and mD</head><p>Tracking algorithms identify which locations at frame t i and t iþ1 correspond to the same particle. In nearest-neighbor methods, this correspondence is established by creating unique bonds between particle locations based on proximity. These algorithms consider all possible assignments and choose the combination that yields the minimal total displacement for all particles. However, if each frame holds P particle positions, the network of bonds has O(P!) possible combinations, which makes the solution impractical even for small values of P (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1A</ref>). As a workaround, nearest-neighbor methods limit the possible bonds to only those that are shorter than the preset parameter 'mD' (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1B</ref>, dashed circle). In this way, the problem is reduced to solve a set of smaller sub-networks, where the number of combinations reduces to O(P ln(P)), that has a significantly lower computational cost (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Crocker and Grier, 1996</ref>). However, mD has to be set wisely. It has to be small enough to discard false bonds, but large enough to detect all bonds that represent real particle displacements. It has been suggested thatThe assignment of exclusive bonds between P locations at consecutive frames is computationally expensive because there are O(P!) possible combinations to consider. (B) Using the search radius mD, the algorithm only needs to consider bonds that are shorter than mD, thus significantly reducing the number of combinations to O(P ln(P)). (C) The value of mD can eventually be reduced to improve further the computation time. (D) If mD is smaller than the typical one-frame displacement of the particles, most bonds are discarded and the trajectories are interrupted. (E) Top: schematic probability density functions (pdfs) for d and D/2. Bottom: cumulative density functions corresponding to the distributions above. Shaded regions below each distribution illustrates the trade off made when setting a value for mD (vertical dashed line). In this example, due to the overlap between distributions, for mD ¼ 7 pix, 99.8% of real bonds are detected (vertical lines shadow) at the cost of also detecting 16% of spurious bonds to neighboring particles (horizontal lines shadow) the optimal magnitude of mD (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Crocker and Grier, 1996</ref>) should satisfy:</p><formula>d &lt; mD &lt; D 2 ; (1)</formula><p>where d is the typical displacement of the particles during one frame (particle velocity times inter-frame interval), and D is the typical inter-particle distance. The first inequality ensures that real particle steps are detected, and the second inequality discards spurious bonds to nearby particles. In practice, particle speeds (d) are typically unknown a priori and it is customary to set mD as large as possible to minimize the risk of missing fast displacements. Although this strategy do not discard spurious bonds, while d &lt; D the algorithm will make the right connections. The real problem is that increasing mD boosts the number of candidate bond combinations, and computation time becomes too long.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1A</ref>–D depicts the effect of different mD choices on the configuration of candidate bonds: while an overestimated mD yields an excessive number of bond combinations (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1A</ref>), when mD is too small trajectories are interrupted because real particle displacements are excluded (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1D</ref>). In summary, mD is typically chosen as large as possible while computation time remains practical. Additionally, both d and D fluctuate from particle to particle and in time, and they are distributed as schematized in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1E</ref>. If the d and D distributions are well separated, a value of mD between them is enough, but when they overlap a trade-off is required (see<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1E</ref>and F). When the overlap of these distributions is extensive, the system is ill-conditioned because the computationally affordable value of mD is not large enough for all d, and some trajectories will necessarily be interrupted. Specifically, the systems where D is spatially inhomogeneous are challenging for tracking because dense regions broaden and shift the D/2 distribution to the left, increasing the overlap and hampering the performance. Although this limitation originates from dense regions, the impact on performance is ubiquitous, because mD is chosen globally.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Locally adaptive SPT</head><p>Instead of using a global value of mD to determine the set of candidate bonds, we propose to build a function mD(x,y,t), that adapts to local space and time fluctuations of the nearest-neighbor distance D(x,y,t). In this way, we restrict the length of candidate bonds mostly within crowded regions, where it is more necessary, but allow particles in low density regions to make longer bonds. In order to satisfy the needs of high-content studies, we propose an algorithm that computes mD(x,y,t) from previously detected particle locations {(x i , y i , t i )}. In order to keep computation time practical, the algorithm chooses mD(x,y,t) to render a number of candidate bonds combinations (CBC) that the computer system can process in viable time. We set mD i ¼ mD(x i ,y i ,t i ) at each particle location to be proportional to the distance to the nearest-neighbor particle D i ¼ D(x i ,y i ,t i ) (see<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2A</ref>and B). However, fast fluctuations of D yield unnecessary oscillations of mD, that can be avoided by replacing D i with an averaged version</p><formula>D / ðx; yÞ ¼ * fD i =ðx i ; y i Þ 2 Bðx; y; /Þ ^ 8t i g +</formula><p>where B(x,y, /) is a circular neighborhood centered at (x,y) of diameter /. The operator &lt;.&gt; indicates set average.</p><p>The number CBC for a given mD(x,y,t) depends, not only on the number of bonds, but also on how they intertwine with one another in sub-networks (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2C</ref>). Because the tracking algorithm solves these sub-networks sequentially, what ultimately limits CBC is the size of the largest sub-network. Because the quantity and structure of the sub-networks are hard to predict, we approached the selection of mD(x,y,t) using an heuristic and exhaustive method. We introduce a multiplicative factor a to scale D / at each frame, so that mDðx; y; tÞ ¼ aðtÞD / ðx; yÞ</p><p>Then, for each pair of consecutive frames we search iteratively the value of a for which the largest sub-network has the size of CBC. For an Intel Core i7-4770K processor running Matlab under linux OS, CBC ¼ 5 Â 10 4 ensures that they can be processed in a few minutes, but this is a parameter that has to be set according to the available computing power. A bisection algorithm is used to choose the value of a that renders a number of combinations as near as possible to predefined tolerance. For each candidate value of a, the whole set of candidate bonds is restricted to include only those shorter than mD, and all uniquely determined one-to-one bonds are discarded. Then, remaining bonds that are connected to each other by sharing a starting or ending position, are flagged as belonging to the same sub-network (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2C</ref>). We estimate the number of combinations for each sub-network by multiplying the number of candidate bonds for each particle in the sub-network as:</p><formula>Y P i¼1 #ðfb ij gÞ</formula><p>where P is the number of particle positions that belong to the subnetwork, {b ij } is the set of candidate bonds starting in position i and ending in j, and #(.) denotes set cardinality. To always ensure track termination, we constrain mD so that it never exceeds the parameter mD max that is determined by visual inspection of data.At the end, we use mD(x,y,t) to reduce the set of candidate bonds with which the C&amp;G algorithm builds the trajectories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Performance assessment of tracking</head><p>In order to evaluate quantitatively the performance of tracking algorithms we compared their outcomes against a set of numerically simulated trajectories T k ¼ fðx k t ; y k t ; tÞ; t ¼ 1.. .F k , which we consider ground-truth (GT). For each test, a set fT k ; k ¼ 1.. .Ng of N trajectories is produced, where each one is a sequence of particle locations along F k time points. The initial coordinates for all trajectories are homogeneously distributed in a hexagonal lattice with inter-particle distance D (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3A</ref>). Each trajectory evolves with normally distributed step sizes (mean value &lt;d&gt; and standard deviation r d ), during F max frames or until it exceeds the image boundaries. Also, the direction of movement changes from frame to frame a certain amount h that is uniformly distributed between 0 and 2p. Pseudo random number generation is done with the Matlab (R2013a) implementation of Mersenne Twister algorithm, using specific initialization seeds in order to make the simulations repeatible. All the locations fðx; y; t=x; y; tÞ 2 T k ^ T k 2 Gg, without repetitions, are processed with the tracking algorithm under analysis, rendering the estimated trajectories E ¼ fT q ; q ¼ 1.. .Mg. Because our study focuses only on the tracking step of SPT, we concentrate on evaluating the performance of making bonds between locations, and not in the detection of objects. To this end, we represent the trajectories in G and E as a sequence of bonds T k ¼ fb k ij g, where b ij represents the bond between locations ðx k i ; y k i ; iÞ and ðx k j ; y k j ; jÞ. To characterize the tracking performance at the level of individual bonds we computed the number of them present in the G that are not in E (false negatives), and the number of bonds in E that are not present in the G (false positives). Additionally, to measure the ability to estimate whole trajectories, we computed the average tracked fraction</p><formula>f ¼ * jT q j jT k j + (2)</formula><p>where T k 2 G, T q is the longest (in time) and continuous segment in E that matches T k. Operator j.j denotes duration in frames. Angle brackets indicate average over G. Because our analysis does not involve detection uncertainties, there is no ambiguity determining the matching locations between T q and T k .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Tracking performance is determined by mD</head><p>The tracking performance of nearest-neighbors algorithms is strongly affected by the choice of mD. To explore this, we numerically simulated trajectories of particles with parameters &lt;d&gt; ¼ 4 pix, r d ¼ 1 pix, N ¼ 400 particles, F max ¼ 100 frames, and D ¼ 24 pixels (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3A</ref>). We process them with the standard C&amp;G algorithm (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Crocker and Grier, 1996</ref>) implemented in Matlab (Mathworks, Inc.) using several values of mD (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3B</ref>and C). For mD above 7 pix, the performance of the tracking shows a plateau, but below this value the performance decreases: There are more false negatives and the average tracked fraction f gets smaller. This effect can be explained by comparing the value of mD with the particle step distribution (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3C</ref>, bottom panel). The value mD ¼ 7 pix represents &lt;d&gt; þ 3 r d , that is &gt;99% of particle possible steps, so most of the real bonds are detected and the performance is almost optimal. On the contrary, as mD gets smaller than &lt;d&gt; þ 3 r d , a greater fraction of the particles get out of the search radius and the performance decreases (see also<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1E</ref>). In summary, the performance gets better by increasing mD, but this also requires longer computation time because a larger number of linking candidates fall inside the search radius. Additionally, computation time grows when particles get near one another. Therefore the choice of mD is also related to the interparticle distance (Equation 1). To study this, we generated time series, similar to those above, but in this case we varied the interparticle distance D. We performed particle tracking on each time series, computing mD with the algorithm described in Section 2.2 by setting D / (x,y) constant and choosing the minimal a among all frames (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3D</ref>, bottom panel). In the top panel of<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3D</ref>, we plotted the performance descriptors versus the inter-particle half distance. The inter-particle distance has a strong impact, not only on the false negatives percentage, but also on the false positive fraction. In fact, as the inter-particle distance gets smaller, mD has to be reduced in order to keep computation time low, what yields an increase of false negatives. Additionally, as particles get too close to each other, the probability of making bonds to nearby trajectories is larger, resulting in more false positives.In summary, when the particles are densely distributed, two effects limit the tracking performance: higher false negatives (and lower tracked fraction f) produced by smaller values of mD, and higher false positives due to more frequent bonds to nearby particles. The latter is an intrinsic problem of time series where the inter-particle half distance is similar to the typical particle step. Algorithms that use more sophisticated criteria for assigning bonds can improve the performance in these cases (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Jaqaman et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Serge et al., 2008</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Tracking performance is low for inhomogeneous distributions of particles</head><p>The effects mentioned above are also observed when only part of the image has densely packed particles. In such cases, the regions of high density limit the maximum value of mD, and this has an impact in the performance of the tracking everywhere. To study such systems, we simulated time series in which the particle density varies along the horizontal coordinate x (see<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4B</ref>–D). We generated such movies by modifying the initial position of trajectories with a gamma transformation applied to x coordinates of all particle positions (Equation 3,<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4A</ref>):</p><formula>x 0 ¼ ðx À x min Þ ðx max À x min Þ c ðx max À x min Þ þ x min ; (3)</formula><p>where x is the horizontal coordinate of the particles in an homogeneous distribution (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3A</ref>), x min and x max are the minimum and maximum values of x, and x 0 are the transformed x coordinates of particles. We generated time series with parameters similar to those studied in Section 3.1 for several values of c. We tracked each one of them with the standard C&amp;G algorithm and plot the performance descriptors versus c in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4E</ref>(top, solid lines and Supplementary Video S1). For each movie we computed the global value of mD (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4E</ref>, bottom) with our automatic algorithm by setting D / (x,y) constant and choosing the minimal a among all frames. For the homogeneous case (c ¼ 1) both false negatives and false positives are $3.5% while the mean tracked fraction f is 63%. However, the performance progressively worsens as c increases because the region on the left of the image becomes crowded with particles, which force the automatic algorithm to choose smaller values of mD (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4E</ref>, bottom).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Adaptive algorithm improves tracking performance</head><p>The decrease of performance observed on inhomogeneous systems (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4E</ref>, top panel) can be mostly explained by the small values of mD (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4E</ref>, bottom panel) imposed by the regions of high density of particles. The effect is similar to the one observed in dense systems (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3D</ref>) but the tracking in the inhomogeneous system can be improved because the particles located on the right are sparse enough to afford larger mD. We propose using the spatially adaptive approach for optimizing the value of mD locally, according to the local density of particles. To test this idea, the same set of time series processed with the standard algorithm (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4E</ref>, solid lines), was processed with the adaptive algorithm described in Section 2.2 (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4E</ref>, dashed lines, and Supplementary Video S2). The parameter /, was set equal to 10 pixels (see Supplementary Note S4). Although the overall performance is reduced as c increases, it is clearly better than for the standard algorithm. The difference between the two approaches shows mostly in the false negatives fraction and the tracked length, although there is also a slight improvement on the fraction of false positives. This is consistent with the fact that the performance improvement for the adaptive algorithm is mostly due to better matching between mD and the local particle density. In<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4F</ref>we plot the performance descriptors for both tracking methods within different spatial regions for inhomogeneous time series with c ¼ 6. Essentially, the trajectories studied in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4E</ref>, are now analyzed within five intervals of x: R 1 ¼<ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr">20</ref>), R 2 ¼<ref type="bibr">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr">40</ref>), R 3 ¼<ref type="bibr">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr">60</ref>), R 4 ¼<ref type="bibr">[60,</ref><ref type="bibr">80</ref>) and R 5 ¼<ref type="bibr">[80,</ref><ref type="bibr">100]</ref>, for values of x expressed in percentage of x max (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4D</ref>). Although in R 1 , the performance improvement is modest because particles are densely packed in R 5 the improvement is dramatic. Due to the ability of adapting the value of mD to the local density, the tracking performance in the sparse regions on the right of the image are not limited by the high density of particles that happens on the left. In this way, the performances are greatly optimized. In order to test the adaptive algorithm in typical challenging conditions, and to compare its performance with state of the art methods, we used the tools developed for the SPT challenge (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chenouard et al., 2014</ref>). The results, described in Supplementary Note S1, show that the adaptive method, using a simple detection algorithm (Supplementary Note S2), presents a performance that is fairly comparable with state of the art SPT methods. However, these tests are not designed to evaluate performance under inhomogeneous conditions, which is the main advantage of the proposed method. Additionally, we compared the adaptive algorithm with u-track tracking which has open source code (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Jaqaman et al., 2008</ref>). This analysis, described in Supplementary Note S6 shows that u-track performs very similarly to the adaptive algorithm for systems similar to those in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4E</ref>, although it shows a small improvement for very inhomogeneous conditions. However, when particles undergo abruptly long displacements, the adaptive algorithm renders better performance than u-track (Supplementary Notes S5 and S6).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Adaptive algorithm improves biophysical measurements</head><p>Inaccurate particle tracking may produce biased biophysical measures like particle speed and mean square displacement (MSD) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chenouard et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Sackmann et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Weimann et al., 2013</ref>). According to the performance analysis in Sections 3.2 and 3.3, it is expected that the accuracy of these biophysical measures may also be hampered in inhomogeneous systems. We analyzed the distribution of one-frame displacements d (instantaneous speed) and MSD curves, since they are biophysical descriptors typically derived from SPT analyzes. We compared the results of analyzing the GT and trajectories estimated with both C&amp;G and the Adaptive algorithm. Because the improvement provided by the adaptive method is mostly within regions where particle density is not extremely high (see<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4F</ref>), we compared only trajectories placed in the rightmost 80% of the movie (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5A</ref>). In<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5B</ref>, we compare the distributions of d using boxplots. Although the median of d distributions on both GT and Adaptive trajectories match the parameter &lt;d&gt; of generated trajectories, the values estimated with C&amp;G are clearly biased towards zero. Similarly, the MSD curve generated from C&amp;G tracking reveals that this method underestimates particle displacement (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5C</ref>) in inhomogeneous movies. Also, since most trajectories are interrupted by missing bonds, the obtained trajectories are short, making it impossible to compute the MSD at large time delays (Dt). The linear fits of the MSD curves yield diffusion coefficients of: D GT ¼ (1.69 6 0.002), D C&amp;G ¼ (0.65 6 0.1), D adap ¼ (1.59 6 0.04), all expressed in pix 2 /frame, that also show the inaccuracy of the Adaptive settings for the nearest-neighbor particleglobal C&amp;G in this case. All these results confirm the problems that arise from using C&amp;G algorithm in inhomogeneous movies with global parameters, and that the method presented here can solve them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Adaptive algorithm for Neutrophils migration assay</head><p>We used the adaptive algorithm to track the movement of neutrophils in the classical under-agarose chemotaxis assay (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Nelson et al., 1975</ref>), using the detection algorithm described in Supplementary Note S3. In this assay, neutrophils migrate by squeezing between a coverslip and a layer of agarose where a diffusing peptide produces a graded concentration of a chemotactic cue. The neutrophils, tagged with a florescent dye, enter the system from the left (<ref type="figure">Fig. 6A</ref>) and migrate towards the right, where the peptide concentration increases. The density of cells is remarkably inhomogeneous and they become difficult to track as explained in previous sections. Using the adaptive algorithm, long trajectories are detected despite the high concentration of cells on the left (see<ref type="figure">Fig. 6A</ref>, and Supplementary Video S3). To quantify the improvement of performance obtained with the proposed method, we also tracked the cells with the standard C&amp;G algorithm. We computed the cumulative tracked length (in time) starting from the longer trajectories, and we plotted it versus the trajectory length (in minutes) for both SPT methods (see<ref type="figure">Fig. 6B</ref>). These results show that the trajectories obtained with the adaptive algorithm are remarkably longer than those obtained with C&amp;G, rendering less biased and more accurate description of the neutrophil migration dynamic system. We finally compared the<ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>. Adaptive algorithm applied to neutrophils migrating in an under-agarose assay imaged at 4 frames per minute: (A) Sample frame with superimposed trajectories. See Supplementary Video S3. (B) Cumulative tracked length (in minutes) of the trajectories of neutrophils versus length of individual trajectories (in minutes): C&amp;G (continuous line), Adaptive (dashed line) algorithm with u-track (Supplementary Note S6). The u-track renders shorter trajectories possibly because it fails to detect unusually long displacements. For tracking objects in dense environments, u-track restricts the search radius using a priori knowledge of particle dynamics. However, this feature comes at the price of missing unexpectedly long displacements while the adaptive algorithm is more flexible for these types of dynamics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusion</head><p>The field of particle tracking has evolved significantly during the last two decades, allowing to perform in very challenging conditions such as dense systems, blinking particles and low-quality images. Several methods assume dynamic models of particle movement to face some of these challenges, but these assumptions may in certain cases bias results if the behavior of the system is not fully characterized a priori. In this work, we propose a novel approach for optimizing the performance of the popular nearest-neighbor SPT algorithm by C&amp;G in systems with inhomogeneous particle density. This method adapts the parameter mD to the local density of the particles both in space and time, boosting the tracking performance dramatically. Furthermore, even in systems that are not manifestly inhomogeneous, the standard nearest-neighbor algorithm is unstable due to slight variations of density that make the computation time to increase abruptly. Our improvement prevents these situations, providing the robustness needed for high content studies. Finally, this approach can be applied to more complex methods (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Jaqaman et al., 2008</ref>) and potentially other algorithms that depend on a parameter equivalent to mD (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chenouard et al., 2013</ref>). We demonstrate quantitatively the advantages of the adaptive method by comparing it with the standard C&amp;G algorithm and other state of the art methods using numerical simulations and experimental data.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig.1.</head><figDesc>Fig. 1. Nearest-neighbor bond assignment: (A) The assignment of exclusive bonds between P locations at consecutive frames is computationally expensive because there are O(P!) possible combinations to consider. (B) Using the search radius mD, the algorithm only needs to consider bonds that are shorter than mD, thus significantly reducing the number of combinations to O(P ln(P)). (C) The value of mD can eventually be reduced to improve further the computation time. (D) If mD is smaller than the typical one-frame displacement of the particles, most bonds are discarded and the trajectories are interrupted.

Shaded regions below each distribution illustrates the trade off made when setting a value for mD (vertical dashed line).

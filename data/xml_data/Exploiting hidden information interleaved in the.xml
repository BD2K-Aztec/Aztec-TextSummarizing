				<p>Motivation: Dozens of studies in recent years have demonstrated that codon usage encodes various aspects related to all stages of gene expression regulation. When relevant high-quality large-scale gene expression data are available, it is possible to statistically infer and model these signals, enabling analysing and engineering gene expression. However, when these data are not available, it is impossible to infer and validate such models. Results: In this current study, we suggest Chimera—an unsupervised computationally efficient approach for exploiting hidden high-dimensional information related to the way gene expression is encoded in the open reading frame (ORF), based solely on the genome of the analysed organism. One version of the approach, named Chimera Average Repetitive Substring (ChimeraARS), estimates the adaptability of an ORF to the intracellular gene expression machinery of a genome (host), by computing its tendency to include long substrings that appear in its coding sequences; the second version, named ChimeraMap, engineers the codons of a protein such that it will include long substrings of codons that appear in the host coding sequences, improving its adaptation to a new host&apos;s gene expression machinery. We demonstrate the applicability of the new approach for analysing and engineering heterologous genes and for analysing endogenous genes. Specifically, focusing on Escherichia coli, we show that it can exploit information that cannot be detected by conventional approaches (e.g. the CAI—Codon Adaptation Index), which only consider single codon distributions; for example, we report correlations of up to 0.67 for the ChimeraARS measure with heterologous gene expression, when the CAI yielded no correlation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The inherent redundancy of the genetic code, where 61 codons encode only 20 amino acids, is a widely studied phenomenon (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chamary et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Plotkin and Kudla, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sauna and KimchiSarfaty, 2013</ref>). In recent years, it has been shown that various gene expression regulatory aspects are interleaved in this redundancy. Specifically, during its lifetime the messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence interacts with various intracellular molecules and complexes, such as the spliceosome (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cartegni et al., 2002</ref>), pre-initiation complex (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kozak, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zur and Tuller, 2013a, b</ref>(<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ramakrishnan 2002</ref>) and ribosomal RNA composing it (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Li et al., 2012</ref>), tRNAs (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alberts et al., 2002</ref>), micro-RNAs (miRNAs;<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Forman and Coller, 2010</ref>), other mRNAs (<ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Zur and Tuller, 2012</ref>), proteins (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hogan et al., 2008</ref>) (including transcription factors;<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Stergachis et al., 2013</ref>), and the mRNA sequence itself via its folding (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gu et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Tuller et al., 2011</ref>) (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>). The affinity of these interactions is affected by the nucleotide composition in various parts of the transcript (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alberts et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Cannarozzi et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chamary et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Forman and Coller, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gu et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hogan et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kozak, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kudla et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Li et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Plotkin and Kudla, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Schnall-Levin et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Stergachis et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Tuller et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Zur and Tuller, 2012</ref>; Zur and Tuller, 2013a, b), and can usually be described by Markovian models and/or position-specific scoring matrices (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Pevsner, 2009</ref>). However, there are debates regarding the nature and the efficiency of some of these interactions (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Plotkin and Kudla, 2010</ref>). The studies mentioned earlier support the conjecture that it is possible to accurately predict gene expression aspects based solely on the coding sequence, and that by manipulating synonymous aspects of the coding sequence itself, it is possible to affect all gene expression stages. There are three major drawbacks to the current measures for inferring gene expression based on the coding sequence (ORF):</p><p>First, most of the conventional methods for estimating the adaptiveness of a transcript to the gene expression regulatory machinery are based on the independent distribution of single codons in the coding sequence (i.e. single codon usage bias). Although there are dozens of measures based on single codon distributions (dos<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Reis et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Sharp and Li, 1987</ref>), these methods often fail to exhibit meaningful relations with the (usually heterologous) expression levels of genes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Goodman et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kudla et al., 2009</ref>). It is clear that such indexes cannot fully capture all the gene expression information encoded in the ORF as some of it is not directly related to codon decoding. For example, the binding site of miRNAs is around 22 nt, information not fully described by the independent distribution of single codons. Thus, a simple approach that can capture various aspects of gene expression regulation (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>) is needed; we term this type of statistical information as 'high-dimensional information' as it is related to substrings of nucleotides longer than codons. This type of statistic has the potential to encapsulate all known and unknown intracellular interactions. Second, currently most of the models related to the biophysical nature of the various interactions of macro-molecules with the ORF are based on the analyses of gene expression measurements (e.g. mRNA levels, protein levels, ribosomal densities, etc.) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">dos Reis et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lee et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Reuveni et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Schwanhausser et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Vogel et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Zur and Tuller, 2013a</ref>, b); specifically, this information can be used for inferring the parameters of the simulative and/ or predictive gene expression models. However, today there are around 26 000 genomes of different organisms (http://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/genome), but large-scale gene expression information [e.g. protein abundance (PA) measurements] is available for only a few dozen (<ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Wang et al., 2012</ref>). Thus, we aim to develop an unsupervised measure that is based solely on the genome of the analysed organism, without the necessity of additional gene expression measurements. Third, there is a growing surge of new studies reporting novel rules related to the ways various aspects of gene expression are encoded in the transcript. One relatively simple rule suggests that the distribution of codon pairs affects gene expression and the fitness of organisms and viruses (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Coleman et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Irwin et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Tats et al., 2008</ref>); however, many of these rules are more complicated and complex (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Li et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Plotkin and Kudla, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Stergachis et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Zur and Tuller, 2013a</ref>, b) (see also Supplementary Material). Thus, it is apparent that numerous additional rules are yet to be deciphered. Moreover, many of the established rules are organism specific and/or condition/tissue specific, and may not hold in different organisms/conditions than the ones used for their inference. Thus, we aim at developing a measure that can exploit 'hidden' (i.e. unexplored) gene expression information encoded in the ORF, which may be related to yet unknown gene expression rules. In the following sections, we describe an approach which encapsulates all the three points mentioned above. Additionally, we devise a novel approach for engineering genes for heterologous gene expression (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Goodman et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Gustafsson et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Plotkin and Kudla, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Vervoort et al., 2000</ref>) based on the aforementioned concepts. In Section 2 (and Supplementary Material), we will describe our new computationally efficient approach for exploiting hidden highdimensional information interleaved in the redundancy of the genetic code without prior knowledge. Since our approach is based on engineering new genes or analysing genes based on patterns that appear in different endogenous genes, we named it Chimera, which is a mythological creature composed of three different animals. In Section 3, we will show that indeed such high-dimensional information appears in the coding regions of the analysed organisms, and that we can at least partially infer it with our approach. As a model organism we analyse Escherichia coli, which is the only organism with large-scale measurements of heterologous gene expression.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methods</head><p>Inspired by universal approaches for data compression without any prior knowledge of its statistical characteristics (<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Ulitsky et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Ziv and Lempel, 1977</ref>), we suggest the Chimera approach. Generally, the approach is based on the idea that various aspects of gene expression (mentioned above) are encoded in the ORF; thus, these 'codes' (information) are frequently repeated in the codingsequences of the organism; in addition, we expect to see more of these codes in genes (both heterologous and endogenous) that are highly expressed and/or more tightly regulated. Furthermore, based on this idea we can optimize the expression levels of a heterologous gene by engineering its codons (substrings of codons and not only single ones) such that they will be similar to the ones that appear in the endogenous genes of the host. This approach can be extrapolated to many variants, two of which we will consider in this study: (i) a new measure for the adaptation of the coding sequence to the intracellular gene expression regulatory machinery named Chimera Average Repetitive Substring or ChimeraARS and (ii) a new algorithm for engineering heterologous genes without prior knowledge and based only on the genome of the host named ChimeraMap. In this section, we briefly describe ChimeraARS and ChimeraMap. The ChimeraARS is depicted in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2A</ref>. A given gene which codes a protein, P, can be described as a sequence of codons, S; thus, the new measure is based on the tendency of substrings in S to appear in other genes, that is, in a reference set G. It is important to mention that various definitions of G are possible, including considering only highly expressed genes. For simplicity and demonstrating the unsupervised advantage of our approach, we assume that G includes the entire genome. The measure is based on the assumption that evolution shapes the organismal coding sequences to improve their interaction with the intra-cellular gene expression machinery. Thus, if longer substrings of S tend to appear in the organism's ORFs, it suggests that P is more optimized to the intra-cellular gene expression machinery, and thus it is probably more highly expressed. In addition, as we explain in the following subsection, our measure also has important statistical and information theoretic properties. Computing the ChimeraARS score, ChimeraARS(G,S), of a coding sequence (S) given a reference genome (G) includes the following steps (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2A</ref>; further details in the following subsections):</p><p>1. For each position i in the coding sequence S find the longest substring S j i that starts in that position, and also appears in at least one of the coding sequences of the genome G. 2. Let jSj denote the length of a sequence S; the ChimeraARS of S is the mean length of all the substrings S j i :RS j i =jSj.</p><p>As we demonstrate in the ensuing subsections, the ChimeraARS exploits information that does not appear in single codon distributions. Thus, among others, it can be used for estimating the adaptation of the composite codon content of a gene to the cellular gene expression machinery; because highly expressed genes are expected to be more adapted, it can specifically be used for predicting the protein levels of a gene from its codon distribution, while considering the high-dimensional distribution of codons. The objective of the ChimeraMap algorithm is described in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2B</ref>(further details in the following subsections). Given a target protein (P), whose coding sequence is S, and a host genome (G), ChimeraMap finds a new coding sequence (S*) that codes the protein P but is composed of a minimal number of (non-overlapping) 'codon blocks' that appear in the host genome (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2B</ref>). If several blocks of the same length exist, we select the most frequent one, thus further improving the adaptability of S* to G. We believe that the ChimeraMap can be used for optimizing the coding sequences of heterologous genes for expressing them in a new host. It is easy to see that under this construction, the boundaries between blocks are the only regions with codon sequences that may not appear in the host genome; the ChimeraMap minimizes these regions by minimizing the number of 'codon blocks'. Since the 'codon blocks' already appear in the host genome, they are expected to be compatible with the host gene expression machinery; the boundaries between blocks, on the other hand, correspond to substrings that do not appear in the host genome, thus they may not be compatible with the host gene expression machinery and ChimeraMap minimizes them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Properties of the ChimeraMap and the ChimeraARS approaches</head><p>All the details regarding the algorithms for the computation of the ChimeraARS score and the ChimeraMap output appear in the following subsections. Here, we only briefly outline the algorithmic approach and mention the general properties of these algorithms. ChimeraARS is based on a pre-processing step of generating a suffix tree (or array) of all the coding sequences of the reference genome (G); based on this suffix tree all the longest substrings of the target P can be computed in an efficient manner, resulting in a total running time complexity of OðjGj þ jPj). The ChimeraMap is also based on the same pre-processing step in addition to a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm that finds the optimal solution with total running time complexity of OðjGj þ jPjÞ. ChimeraARS (and thus the ChimeraMap objective) is inspired by information theoretic approaches for universal compression of Markovian sequences, and estimating the number of bits required for describing one sequence (S) given a second one (G) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Farach et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Ulitsky et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Wyner, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Wyner and Wyner, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Ziv and Lempel, 1977</ref>). More specifically and formally, let x n denote a codon sequence of length n. Specifically, if the codon distribution in G and S is generated by Markovian processes with probability distributions M S and M G (M S ðx n Þ=M G ðx n Þ is the probability of emitting x n based on the Markovian model M S /M G respectively), the ChimeraARS(G,S) estimates the following measure (see proofs and/or explanations in<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Ulitsky et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Wyner, 1993</ref>):certain ORF, we find for each codon (or nucleotide) position in the ORF the longest substring that starts in this position, but also appears in one of the ORFs of the genome. The score is based on the average over the lengths of all these substrings. (B) An illustration of the ChimeraMap measure. The objective function of this algorithm is covering the coding sequence of the target gene with a minimal number of most frequent codon blocks that appear in the host genome, such that the protein encoded in the resulting coding sequence is identical to the protein encoded in the target gene. Under this construction, the boundaries between blocks are the only regions with codon sequences that may not appear in the host genome; the ChimeraMap minimizes these regions by minimizing the number of blocks</p><formula>logðGÞ=ÀE MS logðM G Þ (1) ÀE MS logðM G Þ ¼ lim n!1 X x n M S ðx n Þ Á logð1=M G ðx n ÞÞ (2)</formula><p>If the distribution of S and G is similar, S can be better compressed by G. If M s ¼ M G , then the ChimeraARS(G,S) [<ref type="bibr">Equation (1)</ref>] converges to log ðjGjÞ=HðM S Þ, where H(M S ) is the entropy of M S and it is known that H(M S ) is smaller than ÀE MS log ðM G Þ<ref type="bibr">[Equation (2)</ref>] for M s = M G. Finally, by definition, genes designed according to the ChimeraMap algorithm should have higher ChimeraARS scores: ChimeraMap engineers the coding sequence of the target gene such that it will include long substrings that appear in a reference genome, while the ChimeraARS measure detects the tendency of a coding sequence to include long substrings that appear in a reference genome, and thus its adaptability to the genome's gene expression machinery.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">The Chimera algorithms</head><p>1. The algorithm of the first version, ChimeraARS: The pre-processing step of the algorithm is based on building a suffix tree (or suffix array) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gusfield, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Manber and Myers, 1993</ref>) for the coding sequences of the host genome. This can be done in O(jGj), where jGj is the length of the proteome/coding sequences of the host (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Farach, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Manber and Myers, 1993</ref>). We will discuss the complexity of a suffix tree implementation, though due to the genomes' size in practice sometimes a suffix array implementation is advisable if space considerations are more critical than time. Then, the length of the longest substring starting at each position in the target gene that appears in the host genome can be found in an efficient manner in O(jPj) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gusfield, 1997</ref>) [matching statistics algorithm, pp. 132–134, this is achieved by building the suffix tree for G maintaining the suffix links (shortcuts between internal nodes related to substrings and their suffixes), which are then utilized together with the skip/count trick to shorten traversal time]. Thus, the total time complexity of the algorithm is O(jGj þ jPj).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The algorithm</head><p>of the second version, ChimeraMap: This is a DP algorithm that builds an optimized representation of a given protein P, maintaining the encoded protein, to that of a specified reference (host) genome G, by minimizing the number of (most frequent) substrings from the reference genome required to cover it. This problem naively solved is essentially exponential. ChimeraMap reduces this to polynomial time based on the observation that the optimal solution can be greedily extended in each DP step. Similarly to the ChimeraARS, the pre-processing step of the algorithm is based on building a suffix tree (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gusfield, 1997</ref>) for the coding sequences of the reference genome in time O(jGj). The premise of the algorithm is that all that is necessary is to consider only the previous step in the DP optimal solution space. Thus, utilizing DP, at each step i (in which the length i of the substring of P we are looking at grows by 1 from the previous step, with i being from 1 to jPj), we look at the previous step's (i À 1) optimal solution and determine based on it what the optimal solution for step i is. The manner in which ChimeraMap tries to elongate the previous optimal solution to length i is as follows. Each optimal solution is represented by a list of pairs of numbers, symbolizing the start and end positions of the substrings (blocks) covering P up to that point (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2B</ref>). ChimeraMap looks at the last such block (<ref type="bibr">[start end]</ref>) and tries to find a match in the suffix tree of G for P(start:i), and if that fails for P(end þ 1:i). If we maintain a pointer to the end of solution i À 1 in the suffix tree, then we can check in O(1) if there is a match for P(start:i), by simply continuing the down traversal on the current edge to the next character. If a match is found we are done, otherwise a pointer is kept to the root of the tree and we can begin the search for P(end þ 1:i) in constant time. Thus, we get a total time complexity of O(jGj þ jPj). One interesting observation regarding the properties of the ChimeraMap is that there exists a maximal length for a 'covering' substring from a reference genome. Let lcsMAX denote the length of the longest substring that is common to P and G. lcsMAX can be calculated using the common suffix tree of P that is found in G and all its prefixes. If the sequences G and P are generated by a Markov process, O(lcsMAX) is expected to be of the order of O(logjGj) [see Equation</p><p>(1)]; in the analysed organism, jGj equals 3 958 573, the log of which is 15.2, while the mean lcsMAX is 15.3 with a standard deviation (STD) of 38.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">The optimality of the ChimeraMap</head><p>Here, we prove that the DP algorithm for the second version of the Chimera approach, the ChimeraMap, indeed finds an optimal solution with induction, n ¼ jPj. The base case: i = 1: The algorithm initiates with the first character of P. The first solution is therefore the block<ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">1]</ref>, and it is trivially optimal. Inductive step: assume optimality for i = n-1: We assume we have optimal solutions for all the algorithm steps up to n À 1. Prove optimality for i = n: The algorithm at each step looks back at the previous solution and elongates it according to the following rule: look at the last mapped block (<ref type="bibr">[start end]</ref>) of the solution and try to find a match in the suffix tree for P(start:i), and if that fails for P(end þ 1:i). If a match is found, merge to the current previous solution in the appropriate manner. For each solution, we elongate its last block, thus not increasing the number of substrings covering P, and since that solution was optimal, so is our solution for i. If we cannot elongate an existing block, we will open a new one, [end þ 1 i], thus increasing the previous optimal solution by one. If an existing block could have been elongated, this solution is chosen as the optimal for step i. If not, the optimal solution grows by no more than one. Now assume that the optimal solution of step i ¼ n includes l blocks. We assume that the algorithm found all the optimal solutions for i &lt; n and show that it will find the optimal solution for i ¼ n. Since the optimal solution of i ¼ n includes l blocks, the optimal solution for i ¼ n À 1 includes either l À 1 or l blocks. If it is of length l À 1, then no extension of the last block exists, and the algorithm adds a new block to the ith solution. If it is of length l blocks, this means that an extension exists. Let us assume by negation that the last block of the solution i ¼ n À 1 is of length w and represents the string a and cannot be extended. Thus, since according to our assumption the optimal solution for the ith step includes l blocks, there must be a block representing the string b of length &gt; w that can be extended. But a is a suffix of b and therefore can also be extended, contradicting our negation assumption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Additional information</head><p>Due to lack of space, additional information related to the Chimera approach, datasets analysed, statistical analysis, and the Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Sharp and Li, 1987</ref>), appear in the Supplementary Material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Results</head><p>The following analysis further demonstrates the relation described above between the ChimeraMap algorithm and the ChimeraARS scores. We uniformly selected 100 E.coli genes according to their PA levels and created the following variations: (i) Performing 100 randomizations of these genes while maintaining the encoded protein, the amino acid bias, and the codon usage bias per gene (Supplementary Material). (ii) We optimized them according to the CAI rationale, replacing every synonymous codon with its most abundant version, which we termed MFSC (most frequent synonymous codon), a variation representing the encapsulation of single codon distribution. (iii) We engineered them according to the ChimeraMap. The results of this analysis can be seen in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>, where clearly and significantly the ChimeraMap engineered genes obtain the highest ChimeraARS scores compared with both the randomized and MFSC versions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">High-dimensional information is encoded in the codon usage bias and can be exploited by the Chimera approach</head><p>In this subsection, we show that high-dimensional information appears in the coding sequences of organisms via several tests. This was achieved by comparing the ChimeraARS scores of endogenous E.coli genes with the ones obtained for randomized genomes that maintain the protein content and frequencies of single codons. If indeed patterns of substrings of codons (longer than one) tend to repeat in the endogenous genome more than expected by chance, the ChimeraARS scores will tend to be higher in the real genome in comparison with the randomized genome. Specifically, in order to compute the ChimeraARS measure for endogenous genes, for each gene instead of using the entire genome, we considered all the genes excluding the current one as the reference genome. First, we computed the ChimeraARS measure for the real and randomized E.coli genome; the randomized genome encoded the same protein and single codon frequencies in each gene as in the original E.coli genome; however, it did not include the same higher dimensional distributions (further details in the Supplementary Material). For each gene, we calculated its ChimeraARS score, which is the mean over the maximum substring length of each of its codon/nucleotide positions, that can be found in all the other genome genes. The distributions of the ChimeraARS scores in the real versus the randomized genome appear in<ref type="figure">Figure 4A</ref>, after removing paralogs in order to demonstrate that the relation cannot be attributed to sequence similarity among paralogs (see Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S1</ref>for an analysis including all the genes). As can be seen, the ChimerARS scores are significantly higher in the real genome (16.7 versus 11.1; P ¼ 10 À54 ). This result supports the conjecture that long substrings of codons/nucleotides tend to appear in the coding sequences of the analysed organism more than expected by chance; thus, this result supports the hypothesis that at least some of the repetitive codon substrings affect the fitness of E.coli. The analyses performed in the next subsections support the conjecture that this high-dimensional information is probably related at least partially to gene expression regulation, as ChimeraARS scores correlate with the expression levels of endogenous and heterologous genes. We performed an additional validation where we wanted to verify that the engineered genes which the ChimeraMap algorithm produces maintain the noted higher length distribution, and that it is higher than the one obtained for randomized genomes also in this case. To this end, taking each gene as a target, we built its ChimeraMap version, which encodes the same protein, but is composed of the maximal most frequent substrings in all the other genes of the genome (excluding the current gene). We performed this for the real and randomized E.coli genome, respectively. As can be seen in<ref type="figure">Figure 4B</ref>, indeed the ChimeraMap engineered genes have higher ChimeraARS scores in the real genome (18.2 versus 16.8; P ¼ 10 À173 ). This result further substantiates the conjecture that long substrings of codons do tend to appear in the coding sequences of the analysed organism more than expected by chance, and that the ChimeraMap algorithm can exploit this information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Measures based on the Chimera approach correlate with various aspects of gene expression and include information that does not appear in conventional codon usage bias measures</head><p>In the previous subsection, we showed that long substrings of codons/nucleotides tend to repeat in the coding sequences of E.coli more than expected by chance. In the current subsection, we will show that the repeated substrings, and thus the ChimeraARS score, are related to the expression levels of endogenous genes. To this end, we compared the correlation obtained between the CAI (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Sharp and Li, 1987</ref>) (a measure based on the independent distribution of single codons; see details in the Supplementary Material), and measurements related to various gene expression aspects/stages (mRNA levels, ribosomal density and protein levels), to the one obtained based on a regressor of both the CAI and ChimeraARS (the analysis was based on cross validation and control for the number of features in the regressor/predictor; more details in the Supplementary Material). As can be seen in<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>, the correlation with gene expression indeed increases when adding the ChimeraARS feature relatively to regression based on the CAI alone, also when controlling for the number of features by computing adjusted correlations (Supplementary Material, see Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure S2</ref>for the correlations achieved for each measure separately); the result supports the conjecture that the ChimeraARS infers information related to expression levels which cannot be detected by conventional approaches such as the CAI. Thus, information related to gene expression regulation is encoded in high-dimensional distributions of codons and nucleotides in the coding sequence.</p></div>

(2013)</ref>recently designed a heterologous gene library utilizing the first 11 amino acids including the initiating methionine from 137 essential genes in E.coli.

Using two promoters and four RBSs (Ribosome Binding Site), they generatedExploiting hidden information14 234 heterologous gene sequences and measured their translation rates. In their paper, Goodman et al. show that there is no correlation between the CAI (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Sharp and Li, 1987</ref>) and the translation rate. Here, we show that the ChimeraARS actually correlates with the translation rates of the<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Goodman et al. (2013)</ref>experiment. Analysing the heterologous E.coli data of<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Goodman et al. (2013)</ref>using as a reference genome, the first 11 codons of each endogenous estimation is expected to correlate with the expression levels and/or gene expression regulation levels of a gene. In addition, we show that the ChimeraARS exploits high-dimensional information that is not included in indexes, such as the CAI, that are based on the distribution of single codons. Furthermore, we suggest a version of the Chimera approach, ChimeraMap, that can be used for engineering new genes for their efficient expression in a new host. The ChimeraMap optimizes the coding sequence encoding a protein such that it will include as few as possible substrings of the host genome (i.e. longer substrings). We show that the output of the ChimeraMap correlates with the ChimeraARS score; in addition, we show that the ChimeraARS score predicts the expression levels of heterologous genes in E.coli well. Thus, the ChimeraMap is expected to be a useful approach for heterologous coding sequence optimization. More generally, the analyses reported in this study suggest that codon bias, if defined accurately, is useful in detecting highly expressed genes in cases where conventional approaches do not work, such as heterologous gene expression (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Goodman et al., 2013</ref>). In addition, we show that the protein levels of endogenous and heterologous genes can be defined by their codon and amino acid content based only on genomic information. Naturally, our approach can be generalized in various ways. For example, here for simplicity (and demonstrating the unsupervised advantage of our approach) the reference set of genes used for the Chimera approach included the entire genome. We can readily think of other relevant reference sets such as highly expressed genes, tissue-specific genes, or genes with a certain function or property. Another variation is related to the objective function of the ChimeraMap algorithm; there are many relevant objective functions, such as functions that penalize shorter codon blocks non-uniformly along the ORF (if we have prior knowledge that certain regions in the ORF contribute less to its regulation), function(s) that trade-off frequency versus substring length in a different manner than the one reported here, or weighted functions according to the frequency of the substrings. Thus, we can extrapolate many variants of the approach, and in that manner calibrate it to suit specific problems. The last example is related to the alphabet used; here, for simplicity, we worked with nucleotides (Supplementary Material); however, it may make sense to work with codons, codon pairs, or divide the codons to sub-sets of codons assumed to be 'identical'. Moreover, a version of the Chimera approach may also be used for engineering and estimating the information related to gene expression encoded in other parts of the gene such as untranslated regions and introns, known to also include signals related to gene expression regulation (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Goodarzi et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Wang and Cooper, 2007</ref>). The ChimeraARS algorithm may also be modified to consider both substrings' lengths and their frequencies. In such a case, the major challenge is to model the trade-off between length and frequency. We believe that the trade-off is organismal specific and should be inferred for each organism separately, possibly based on gene expression (adding additional layers of complexity to such a measure). Finally, in this study, we analysed E.coli because this is the only organism with large-scale measurements of both heterologous and endogenous gene expression data. However, we believe that the results reported here will be even more significant for eukaryotes, and specifically multi-cellular organisms such as plants; there are different stages of gene expression, including many types of interactions with the mRNA molecules that occur only in these groups of organisms; for example, splicing, interaction with the nuclear pores, and regulation by miRNA (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>), occur only in eukaryotes; all these examples include interactions between the intracellular machinery and the mRNA molecule, and are at least partially encoded in the ORF via the high-dimensional distribution of codons. These signals are expected to be detected by the Chimera approach, but not by single codon measures of codon usage bias.</p></div>

			<note place="foot">E.coli gene (such that it will correspond to the first 11 codons that were modified in the heterologous gene library), we calculate the ChimeraARS score for each of the heterologous 11 codon long coding sequences. We calculated the correlation of the Goodman et al. translation rates with the ChimeraARS score, and compared these with the ones achieved for the CAI. As can be seen in Figure 6, although the CAI does not correlate with the translation rates of the heterologous gene library (correlation between À0.34 and 0.09; and mostly not significant, where the negative correlation is in the wrong direction), the ChimeraARS does (correlation mostly between 0.3 and 0.67; all P &lt; 0.02,). This result demonstrates that the ChimeraARS can detect the expression of genes also in heterologous systems; in addition, it supports the conjecture that the relation between the ChimeraARS score and expression levels reported in the previous subsection is at least partially causal/direct—higher ChimeraARS scores contribute to higher expression levels (because these are heterologous and not endogenous genes). Finally, since by definition (as explained above) genes designed by the ChimeraMap algorithm have higher ChimeraARS scores, these results support the conjecture that the ChimeraMap algorithm should be able to optimize expression levels of genes at least in the analysed organism. 4 Discussion We describe a novel computational approach named Chimera for exploiting high-dimensional information related to gene expression that is interleaved in the redundancy of the genetic code, and for engineering coding regions of heterologous genes without prior knowledge. Our approach is inspired by an information theoretic technique for data compression, and is very efficient in terms of computational running time. One version of the approach, ChimeraARS, can be used for estimating the amount of information related to gene expression encoded in a coding sequence, and thereby its adaptability to the cellular gene expression machinery; as we demonstrate here, this Fig. 4. (A) ChimeraARS scores for the real and randomized E.coli genome. The mean ChimeraARS score for the real genome was significantly higher than the random genome (16.7 versus 11.1). Performing a Wilcoxon signedrank test, we received a P-value &lt; 10 À454. (B) ChimeraARS scores for the E.coli real and random genome, as engineered by the ChimeraMap algorithm. The mean ChimeraARS score for the ChimeraMap engineered real genome was significantly higher than that of the engineered random genome (18.2 versus 16.8; performing a Wilcoxon signed-rank test, we received a Pvalue &lt; 10 À173 ); the increase in the ChimeraARS scores relatively to (A) is due to the fact that by definition, ChimeraMap genes that are engineered based on this algorithm tend to include longer repetitive substrings that appear in the host genomic coding sequences, and thus result in higher ChimeraARS scores; this phenomenon can be seen in the random genome as well, further demonstrating ChimeraMap&apos;s ability to engineer genes. In both analyses, paralogs were removed in order to show that the reported signal cannot be attributed to sequence similarity among paralogs. (C) ChimeraARS scores for the real and randomized E.coli genome which maintains the codon pairs distribution, in addition to the single codon distribution and encoded protein (additional details appear in the Supplementary Material). The mean ChimeraARS score for the real genome was significantly higher than the random (16.7 versus 12). Performing a Wilcoxon signed-rank test, we received a P-value &lt; 10 À97 Fig. 5.

			<abstract>
				<p>A recent article identified an artifact in multiple single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data-sets generated by the Fluidigm C1 platform. Specifically, Leng et al. showed significantly increased gene expression in cells captured from sites with small or large plate output IDs. We refer to this artifact as an ordering effect (OE). Including OE genes in downstream analyses could lead to biased results. To address this problem, we developed a statistical method and software called OEFinder to identify a sorted list of OE genes. OEFinder is available as an R package along with user-friendly graphical interface implementations which allows users to check for potential artifacts in scRNA-seq data generated by the Fluidigm C1 platform. Availability and implementation: OEFinder is freely available at https://github.com/lengning/ OEFinder</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) has led to important findings in many fields and is becoming increasingly popular in studies of transcriptome-wide expression (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Deng et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Leng et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Shalek et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Trapnell et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Treutlein et al., 2014</ref>). To facilitate scRNA-seq, the majority of studies utilize the Fluidigm C1 platform for cell capture, reverse transcription and cDNA amplification, as this platform allows for rapid and reliable isolation and processing of individual cells. In spite of the advantages,<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Leng et al. (2015)</ref>identified an artifact in multiple datasets generated by C1 and confirmed that the artifact was present in the cDNA processed by the C1 machine. In particular, in these datasets, there are genes showing higher expression in cells captured in specific capture sites. These capture sites are the ones with small or large plate output IDs. We refer to this artifact as an ordering effect (OE), which has been shown to be independent of organism and laboratory (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Leng et al., 2015</ref>). As detailed in<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Leng et al. (2015)</ref>, accurate identification of OE genes is important to ensure unbiased downstream analyses.<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Leng et al. (2015)</ref>used an ANOVA-based approach to detect OE genes. The ANOVA-based approach performs well in many cases, but has reduced power when few cells are available. (Note that in empirical data, the cells can be missed owing to the random effects of capture failure—an empty capture site, or doublets—capturing more than one cells in one capture site.) To improve power for identifying OE genes, we developed an approach, OEFinder, based on orthogonal polynomial regression. Results show that OEFinder is less sensitive to sample size and outperforms the ANOVA-based approach when few cells are available. OEFinder is implemented in R, a free and open source language, with a vignette that provides working examples. The graphical user interface (GUI) implementations of OEFinder allow users with little V C The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">Expression estimates</head><p>OEFinder requires a genes-by-cells expression matrix. The expression matrix can be either normalized or unnormalized. If the input matrix is unnormalized, OEFinder applies the Median-by-Ratio normalization method introduced by Anders and Huber (2010) prior to OE detection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">Capture site group definitions</head><p>As detailed in<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Leng et al. (2015)</ref>, the capture sites are labeled as A01,. .. , A12, B01,. .. , B12,. .. , H01,. .. , H12. If the capture site IDs are provided, OEFinder groups cells from sites with the same starting letters. When the capture site information is not available, OEFinder groups cells based on their input order. By default, OEFinder groups cells into eight even-sized groups. The number of groups may be changed by the user.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Method</head><p>The normalized expression values of each gene are scaled to zscores. For each gene, OEFinder applies an orthogonal polynomial regression on z-scores against group code. To infer whether gene g follows the OE trend, OEFinder calculates the P-value p g,2 of a onetailed test that tests whether the coefficient of the quadratic term is positive. To account for the goodness of the spline fitting, OEFinder defines an aggregate statistics S g as Àlog(p g,2 ) À log(p model ), in which p model denotes the F test P-value of the full model. OEFinder then generates 10 000 simulated genes from permuted data to evaluate the significance of the observed aggregated statistics. By default, genes with permutation P-value &lt;0.01 are identified as OE genes. The number of simulated genes and the P-value cutoff may be changed by a user (for further details, see Supplementary Section S2).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Simulation studies</head><p>We conducted eight simulation studies to evaluate the performance of the OE detection algorithms. In each simulation, we generated 5000 expressed genes with 500 OE genes. Expression of OE genes was generated based on expression profiles of OE genes detected in empirical data. (Details of the simulations may be found in Supplementary Section S3.) The eight simulation studies evaluate cases with varying numbers of available cells (20–90 cells). Each simulation study contains 100 repeated simulations.<ref type="figure">Figure 1b</ref>and c shows the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FDR) comparing the ANOVA-based method introduced in<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Leng et al. (2015)</ref>and OEFinder. Results indicate that &gt;60 cells are available, both methods have TPR &gt;90% while FDR is controlled &lt;10%. When fewer cells are available, OEFinder has a higher TPR than the ANOVA-based approach and the FDR is still well controlled. The improved power in OEFinder is likely because the polynomial regression in OEFinder fits the OE trend more specifically than the ANOVA-based approach. Additional simulation results may be found in Supplementary Section S4.<ref type="figure">Fig. 1.</ref>(a) OEFinder GUI for identifying OE genes (shown is implementation using R/RGtk2 package; an implementation using R/shiny package is also available, see Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S4</ref>).OEFinder to identify OE genes in scRNAseq</p><formula>(a) (b) (c) 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.</formula></div>

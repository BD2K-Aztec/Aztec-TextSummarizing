				<p>Motivation: Approaches for testing sets of variants, such as a set of rare or common variants within a gene or pathway, for association with complex traits are important. In particular, set tests allow for aggre-gation of weak signal within a set, can capture interplay among variants and reduce the burden of multiple hypothesis testing. Until now, these approaches did not address confounding by family relatedness and population structure, a problem that is becoming more important as larger datasets are used to increase power. Results: We introduce a new approach for set tests that handles confounders. Our model is based on the linear mixed model and uses two random effects—one to capture the set association signal and one to capture confounders. We also introduce a computational speedup for two random-effects models that makes this approach feasible even for extremely large cohorts. Using this model with both the likelihood ratio test and score test, we find that the former yields more power while controlling type I error. Application of our approach to richly structured Genetic Analysis Workshop 14 data demonstrates that our method successfully corrects for population structure and family relatedness, whereas application of our method to a 15 000 individual Crohn&apos;s disease case–control cohort demonstrates that it additionally recovers genes not recoverable by univariate analysis.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Traditional genome-wide association studies (GWAS) test one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at a time for association with disease, overlooking interplay between SNPs within a gene or pathway, missing weak signal that aggregates in sets of related SNPs and incurring a severe penalty for multiple testing. More recently, sets of SNPs have been tested jointly in a gene-set enrichment style approach (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Holden et al., 2008</ref>) and also in seeking association between rare variants within a gene and disease (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bansal et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Wu et al., 2011</ref>). As next-generation sequencing rapidly becomes the norm, these set-based tests, complementary to single SNP tests, will become increasingly important. However, existing methods for testing sets of SNPs do not handle confounding such as arises when related individuals or those of diverse ethnic backgrounds are included in the study. Such confounders, when not accounted for, result in loss of power and spurious associations (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Balding, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Price et al., 2010</ref>). Yet, it is precisely these richly structured cohorts that yield the most power for discovery of the genetic underpinnings of complex traits. Moreover, such structure typically presents itself as data cohorts become larger and larger to enable the discovery of weak signals. In this article, we introduce a new, powerful and computationally efficient likelihood ratio-based set test that accounts for rich confounding structure. We demonstrate control of type I error as well as improved power over the more traditionally used score test. Finally, we demonstrate application of our approach to two real GWAS datasets. Both datasets showed evidence of spurious association owing to confounders in an uncorrected analysis, whereas application of our set test corrected for confounders and uncovered signal not recovered by univariate analysis. Finally, our test is extremely computationally efficient owing to development of a new linear mixed model (LMM) algorithm also presented herein, which makes possible, for example, set analysis of the 15 000 individual Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) data. Several approaches have been used to jointly test sets of SNPs: post hoc, gene-set enrichment in which univariate P-values are aggregated (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Holden et al., 2008</ref>), operator-based aggregation such as 'collapsing' of SNP values (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Braun and Buetow, 2011</ref>;<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Li and Leal, 2008</ref>), multivariate regression, typically penalized (<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Malo et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Schwender et al., 2011</ref>) and variance component (also called kernel) models such as a LMMs (<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Quon et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Wu et al., 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Wu et al., , 2011</ref>). Our approach is based on the LMM, which can equivalently be viewed as a multivariate regression. In particular, use of a LMM with a specific form of genetic similarity matrix is equivalent to regressing those SNPs used to estimate genetic similarity on the phenotype (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hayes et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Listgarten et al., 2012</ref>). If one uses only SNPs to be tested in the similarity matrix as in<ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Wu et al. (2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Wu et al. ( , 2011</ref>), then one is effectively performing a multivariate regression test. However, by also using SNPs that tag confounders in a separate similarity matrix, our model can additionally correct for confounders, as has been done in a *To whom correspondence should be addressed. y The authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the first two authors should be regarded as joint First Authors. ß The Author 2013.

Finally, our approach allows one to condition on other causal SNPs, by way of the similarity matrix, for increased power, again, as has been done in single-SNP test setting (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Atwell et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Listgarten et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Segura et al., 2012</ref>). The use of LMMs to correct for confounders in GWAS is now widely accepted because this approach has been shown capable of correcting for several forms of genetic relatedness such as population structure and family relatedness (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Astle and Balding, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kang et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Price et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Yu et al., 2006</ref>). Independently, the use of LMMs to jointly test rare variants has become prevalent (<ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Wu et al., 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Wu et al., , 2011</ref>). In our new approach, we marry the aforementioned uses of LMMs to perform set tests in the presence of confounders within a single, robust and well-defined statistical model. Because of the aforementioned equivalence, our approach can also be viewed as a form of linear regression with two distinct sets of covariates. The first set of covariates consists of SNPs that correct for confounders (and other causal SNPs), i.e. those that predict race and relatedness, for example. Inclusion of these SNP covariates makes the data for individuals independently and identically distributed (i.e. knowing the value of these SNPs induces a common distribution from which the individuals are drawn). The second set of covariates consists of SNPs for a given set of interest, such as those SNPs belonging to a gene. We call our approach FaST-LMM-Set. Computing the likelihood for our model—an LMM with two random effects—is, naively, extremely expensive, as it scales cubically with the number of individuals (e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Listgarten et al., 2010</ref>). For example, on the 15 000 individual WTCCC dataset we analyse, currently available algorithms would need to compute and store in memory genetic similarity matrices of dimension 15 000 Â 15 000 and repeatedly perform cubic operations on them to test just a single set of SNPs—a practically infeasible approach. However, extending our previous work that made LMMs with a single random effect linear in the number of individuals (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lippert et al., 2011</ref>) to the two-variance component model needed here, we bypass this computational bottleneck, yielding a new two-random-effects algorithm, which is linear in the number of individuals. This advance enables us to analyse datasets, which could not otherwise be practically analysed, such as the 15 000 individual WTCCC cohort (The Wellcome Trust Case<ref type="bibr">Control, 2007</ref>). As a case in point, using the naı¨venaı¨ve cubic approach to test the gene set IL23R (containing 14 SNPs) took 13 h as compared with 1 min for our new approach (all on a single processor), demonstrating a speedup factor of 780 (and significantly less memory usage because the genetic similarity matrix need never be computed with our approach).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">METHODS</head><p>Let Nðvju; RÞ denote a multivariate Normal distribution in v with mean u and covariance matrix D. The log likelihood of a one-variance-component LMM in the linear regression view is given by LL log Z N yjXb þ 1 p s Vw; 2 e I Á N wj0; 2 g I dw, where y is a 1 Â N vector of phenotype values for N individuals; b is the set of the fixed effects of the covariates stored in the design matrix X; I is an N Â N identity matrix; 2 e is the residual variance in the regression; w are the 1 Â N random effects for the SNPs stored in the design matrix V (dimension N Â s), and N wj0; 2 g I is the distribution for the weight parameters. That is, the random regression weights, w are marginalized over independent Normal distributions with equal variance 2 g. Equivalently, and more typically, the log likelihood is written with random effects marginalized out, LL ¼ log N yjXb; 2 e I þ 2 g K , where the genetic similarity (called the kernel in some contexts), K, is given by K¼ 1 s VV T , as is the case, for example, when K is the realized relationship matrix (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hayes et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lippert et al., 2011</ref>). Given this equivalence, the SNPs used to estimate genetic similarity (those in V) can be interpreted as a set of covariates in the regression. In our model, we partition the random effects into two sets: one set of random effects, w C (with design matrix V C ), is used to correct for confounders (and condition on causal SNPs) using s c SNPs, whereas the other set, w S , is used to test the s s SNPs of interest in the corresponding design matrix, V S. The log likelihood (in the linear regression view) is then written LL ¼ log</p><formula>ZZ N yjXb þ V C p s c w C þ V S p s s w S ; 2 e I Á N w C j0; 2 C I À Á N w S j0; 2 S I À Á dw C dw S ,</formula><p>where each set of random effects has a separate variance ( 2 C and 2 S ). Again, we can equivalently write this in the marginalized form,</p><formula>LL ¼ log N yjXb; 2 e I þ 2 C s c V C V T C þ 2 S s s V S V T S :</formula><p>For convenience, we re-parameterize this as LL ¼ log N yjXb; 2</p><formula>e I þ 2 g ½ 1 À ð ÞK C þ K S  , ð1Þ</formula><p>where now the covariance matrix, K, has been partitioned into two variance components:</p><formula>K ð1 À ÞK C þ K S ,</formula><p>using K C 1 sc V C V T C (V C is of dimension N Â s c ) to account for confounders and K S 1 ss V S V T S (V S is of dimension N Â s S ) to model signal from a pre-defined set of SNPs of interest, such as those within a gene. The scalar parameter 2 ½0, 1 is estimated from the data by, for example, restricted maximum likelihood. The null model for our set test is given by ¼ 0, whereas the alternative model allows 1 ! ! 0. Until lately, estimating the parameters and computing the likelihood of a LMM was cubic in the number of individuals. However, we have recently shown that when the number of SNPs used to estimate genetic similarity, s, is less than the cohort size, N, and when genetic similarity matrix, K, factors as VV T (V of dimension N Â s), then the computations (and memory requirement) become linear in N (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lippert et al., 2011</ref>). So far this result has been applied in the context of correcting for confounders in a univariate GWAS with just a single variance component. Originally the s SNPs for inclusion in V were obtained by sampling SNPs genome-wide and relying on linkage disequilibrium (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lippert et al., 2011</ref>). However, in light of the equivalence with linear regression, it became clear that one should choose the SNPs with feature selection as one would do in any statistical modelling problem (<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lippert et al., 2013b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Listgarten et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Listgarten et al., , 2013</ref>). For example, one can do an uncorrected univariate scan of the SNPs to select those which should be used to correct for confounders (and causal SNPs to condition on), and this is precisely the approach we take here, just as in (<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lippert et al., 2013b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Listgarten et al., 2012</ref>). Thus, in our approach, we select s c SNPs for K C by first sorting all available SNPs according to their univariate linear-regression P-values (in increasing order) and then evaluate the use of more and more SNPs in order until we find an optimal number of SNPs (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Listgarten et al., 2012</ref>). This resulted in 650 and 310 SNPs for the Genetic Analysis Workshop 14 (GAW14) and Crohn's analyses, respectively. Additionally, any SNPs that were being tested (i.e. those in V S ), and those within 2 centimorgans, were removed from V C so as not to contaminate the null model (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Listgarten et al., 2012</ref>). This type of approach for correction of confounders in univariate tests has previously been demonstrated to work well on a broad range of datasets (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Listgarten et al., 2012</ref>). The same conclusions apply for a variant of this approach using out-of-sample prediction (<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lippert et al., 2013b</ref>). For estimation of variance parameters and computation of the likelihood ratio test (LRT) statistic, we use restricted maximum likelihood, which is itself a valid likelihood for the LRT and can be computed in the same time and memory complexity as the (unrestricted) likelihood. Details on efficient parameter estimation are provided in (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lippert et al., 2011</ref>). When testing sets in an uncorrected manner, that is, without accounting for confounders (which we did for comparison purposes), we omitted the portion of the variance that corrected for confounders, K C. In particular, we set ¼ 1 and tested the significance of 2 g with the same LRT described next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">P-value computation</head><p>We have now fully specified our model for doing set tests when confounders are present. To obtain a P-value on the set of SNPs of interest, such as those belonging to a gene (i.e. those in V S ), we use an LRT. In particular, to test the significance of the set of SNPs of interest, we compare the maximum restricted likelihood of the data with and without the set of SNPs of interest, that is, the maximum restricted likelihood of the alternative and null models. More formally, our null hypothesis is given by H 0 : ¼ 0, whereas our alternative hypothesis is given by H a : 1 ! ! 0. To obtain calibrated P-values, we require an accurate estimate of the distribution of statistics under the null hypothesis. However, obtaining a sufficiently accurate estimate of this distribution is not straight-forward. Standard software uses a parametric form for this distribution of 0:5 2 o : 0:5 2 1 —a 50–50 mixture of two 2 distributions, the first with zero degrees of freedom and the other with one degree of freedom. The former accounts for the fact that the tested parameter is on the boundary of the allowed space in the null model (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dominicus et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Self and Liang, 1987</ref>)—that is, to account for the fact that ¼ 0 in the null model and 1 ! ! 0 in the alternative. The necessary regularity conditions for this null distribution to hold, include that the outcome variable can be partitioned into a large number of identically and independently distributed sub-vectors (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Greven et al., 2008</ref>)—conditions that are not generally met in our setting because individuals may be arbitrarily related to one another. It has been shown that when the regularity conditions are not met, the 0:5 2 o : 0:5 2 1 distribution yields conservative P-values (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Greven et al., 2008</ref>) because the mixing weight on the 2 o component is too low at 50%. We have also found this to be the case in our setting (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). Although one might consider use of a parametric bootstrap to estimate the null distribution, (e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Greven et al., 2008</ref>), such an approach dramatically increases the running time over computation of the test statistics themselves because of the extremely large number of bootstrap test statistics needed. Yet, another alternative is to use an empirical distribution based on permutations, which faces a similar problem. However, one can use many fewer permutations by instead assuming a parametric form of the null distribution and then fitting the few required parameters to the test statistics generated from the permutations (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lee et al., 2012b</ref>). It is such an approach that we take here. This approach assumes that the null distribution of test statistics is the same across all tests, an assumption that has also been made in the small sample correction in SKAT-O and elsewhere (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Greven, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Greven et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lee et al., 2012b</ref>). The parametric form of the null distribution that we assume, and to which we fit null distribution test statistics to, is inspired by (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Greven, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Greven et al., 2008</ref>), who reported that a mixture of 2 o and a 2 1 , where a is the scaling parameter for the scaled chi-square distribution, yielded good type I control when testing a variance component in a single-component LMM. We use the same parametric form of the null distribution, except, to gain additional flexibility for the two-component LMM, we allow the degrees of freedom on the second component, d, to be different from 1 (finding this to be useful in the sense that we estimate d 6 ¼ 1). That is, we use the null distribution, 2 o : ð1 À Þa 2 d with free parameters , a and d. Using this distributional form, we found that a fit of the free parameters to the (full collection of test) statistics yielded Pvalues that were too liberal in the tail (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). Thus, we instead fit our parametric parameters using only the most significant tail of the null distribution of test statistics—in particular, the top 10% of null test statistics (In our experiments with just a single variance component, P-values were also liberal in the tail—those for which P 5 0.05. This regime was not examined by<ref type="bibr">Greven et al.</ref>). We now describe the details of our approach for estimating the free parameters, , a and d, of this null distribution. To generate a single null test statistic for a set, we permuted the individuals for only the SNPs in that set. Because we do not permute the SNPs (rather, the individuals), the pattern of linkage disequilibrium between the SNPs within a single test remains intact. Although we permute the individuals, who are not (generally) identically and independently distributed, we do so only for the SNPs in the test set, leaving any confounding signal among the covariates, the confounding SNPs and the phenotype intact. We found that null distribution parameter estimates stabilized with the use of 10 permutations per test (for both WTCCC and GAW14). Thus, our procedure has a runtime roughly a factor of 10 larger than if we had not needed permutations. Within a gene, we use the same permutation for all SNPs, and we used the same 10 permutations across all sets. Given this permutation-generated sample of test statistics from the null distribution, we fit the parameters , a and d as follows. The 2 o distribution is a Dirac delta function at 0—that is, this component of the null distribution yields only test statistics of 0, and correspondingly P ¼ 1. Furthermore, the 2 d40 yields a test statistic of 0 with measure zero. Consequently, one can obtain good estimates of the parameters simply by assuming that precisely those tests with variance parameter estimate ¼ 0 belong to the 2 o component, and then estimating as the proportion of tests belonging to this component. We then estimate a and d directly from the non-zero test statistics (those likely to belong to the a 2 d component) using a regression in which these parameters are adjusted such that resulting LRT P-values have the least squared error with the theoretical P-values (derived conditionally on an estimate of ). Specifically, we use the log P-value squared error and only use the smallest 10% of P-values in the regression. This truncated regression approach consistently yielded calibrated quantile–quantile plots (<ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>)The first row shows results for our LRT-based method; the second row ('nontruncated ML') shows results when fitting the null distribution parameters using maximum likelihood with all test statistics; the third row shows results using a 0:5 2 o : 0:5 2 1 null distribution. Results significantly different from expected according to the binomial test (P 5 0.05) are denoted with an asterisk. and also controlled type I error (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). Furthermore, it yielded better power than the score test (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>). In summary, our overall approach is as follows:</p><p>(i) for each set to be tested, permute the individuals of the SNPs belonging to this set, all in the same manner; (ii) compute the restricted LRT statistic for this permuted data to obtain a test statistic from the null distribution; (iii) repeat step 1 ten times; (iv) estimate the proportion of test statistics drawn from the 2 o component, ^ , as the proportion of tests in which the parameter ¼ 0; (v) use the largest 10% of test statistics to perform a regression to fit the a 2 1 component—that is, find ^ a and ^ d, which minimize the squared error of the log 10 P-values with their theoretical values [uniform distribution on ( ^ , 1)]; and (vi) compute the test statistic for all sets (non-permuted data) and then compute the corresponding P-values for these using the null distribution</p><formula>^ 2 o : ð1 À ^ Þ ^ a 2 ^ d .</formula><p>In application to real data (described next), our procedure yielded ¼ 0:641, a ¼ 2:29, d ¼0.961, on the GAW14 data, and ¼ 0:643, a ¼ 1.41, d ¼ 0:85 on the WTCCC data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Datasets and other methods</head><p>The first dataset was obtained from the GAW14 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Edenberg et al., 2005</ref>). It consisted of autosomal SNP data from an Affymetrix SNP panel and a phenotype indicating whether an individual smoked a pack of cigarettes a day or more for 6 months or more. The cohort included over eight ethnicities and numerous close family members—1034 individuals in the dataset had parents, children or siblings also in the dataset. In addition to the curation provided by GAW, we excluded a SNP when either (i) its minor allele frequency was 50.05, (ii) its values were missing in 410% of the population or (iii) its allele frequencies were not in Hardy– Weinberg equilibrium (P50.001). In addition, we excluded an individual when 410% of SNP values were missing. After filtering, there were 7579 SNPs across 1261 individuals. The second dataset comprised the WTCCC 1 data and consisted of SNP and phenotype data for seven common diseases: bipolar disorder, coronary artery disease, hypertension, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, type-I diabetes and type-II diabetes (The Wellcome Trust Case<ref type="bibr">Control, 2007</ref>). Each phenotype set contained $1900 individuals. In addition, the data included a set of $1500 controls from the UK Blood Service Control Group (NBS). The data did not include a second control group from the 1958 British Birth Cohort (58C), as restrictions on it precluded use by a commercial organization. Our analysis for the Crohn's phenotype used data from the NBS group and the remaining six phenotypes as controls (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lippert et al., 2013a</ref>). We filtered SNPs as described by the WTCCC (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Laaksovirta et al., 2010</ref>) and additionally excluded an SNP if either its minor-allele frequency was 51%, it was missing in 41% of individuals or its genetic distance was unknown. After filtering, 356 441 SNPs remained. Unlike the approach used by the WTCCC, we included non-white individuals and close family members to increase the potential for confounding and thereby better exercise the LMM. In total, there were 14 925 individuals across the seven phenotypes and control, as in our previous work (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lippert et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lippert et al., 2013a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Listgarten et al., 2012</ref>). We concentrated our evaluations on Crohn's disease, as inflation for this phenotype was greatest with an uncorrected univariate analysis. For the WTCCC data, we grouped SNPs into gene sets using gene positions provided on the USCSC Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc. edu/) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dreszer et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kent et al., 2002</ref>) using build hg19 (we also converted the original WTCCC annotations to this build), which yielded 13 850 gene sets. Because the GAW14 SNPs mapped to only 251 nonsingleton gene sets with this strategy, we instead formed sets for this dataset by using overlapping 1 centimorgan windows, yielding 2157 sets. For WTCCC, the set sizes ranged from 1 to 748, with a mean value of 11 and a standard deviation of 24. For the GAW14 data, the set sizes ranged from 2 to 38, with a mean value of 5 and a standard deviation of 4. More generally, this approach of forming sets from windows of nearby SNPs along the genome could be used to map an entire genome into sets, even when the SNPs do not lie in genes. However, it is not our goal here to evaluate different ways in which one might group SNPs, but instead to demonstrate that we can test sets of SNPs in the presence of confounders. All analyses assumed additive effects of a SNP on phenotype, using a 0/1/2 encoding for each SNP (indicating the number of minor alleles for an individual). Missing SNP data were mean imputed. Multiple testing was accounted for with a Bonferroni correction. In counting hits for Crohn's disease (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>), we omitted any genes found in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region because this region is complicated by long-range linkage disequilibrium. We used positions 29–34 Mb on chromosome 6 as the boundaries of the MHC, as suggested by the MHC-sequencing consortium (<ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Pereyra et al., 2010</ref>).</p></div>

Dashed red error bars denote the 99% confidence interval around the solid red diagonal. Points shown are for null-only data (generated by permuting individuals in the SNPs to be tested—see Section 2) and only for the non-unity P-values (those assumed to belong to the nonzero degree of freedom component of the null distribution). The portion of the expected distribution of P-values shown is uniform on the interval<ref type="bibr">[ ^ ,1]</ref>, where ^ is the estimated mixing weight in the null distributionwere tested for each dataset). We additionally permuted another 10 datasets to estimate the parameters of the null distribution (, a, d) as prescribed by our approach. For assessment of power, we again used all SNPs from the WTCCC dataset and then generated synthetic phenotypes using an LMM. To do so, we first we fit the null model to the real data to obtain estimates of the parameters 2 e and 2 g. Then we used the model</p><formula>0 2 4 6 8 0 2 4 6 8 Expected −log 10 (P) Observed −log 10 (P)</formula><formula>pðyÞ ¼ N yj0; 2 c K C þ 2 s K S  À Á</formula><p>, with confounding variance 2 c equal to estimated environmental noise, 2 e ¼ 0:094, and genetic variance, 2 s , equal to the estimated genetic variance 2 g ¼ 0:0125. Furthermore, we used the same 310 confounding SNPs for K C as used on the real data while using all 321 839 SNPs further than 2 centimorgans away from those in K C as the causal SNPs for K S (those contained in the true positive sets in our power experiments). We generated five phenotypes in this way. The resulting phenotypes behaved much like the real data in that, on average, we found 10 Bonferroni-corrected sets on each of five datasets, as compared with the 23 found on the real data (note that<ref type="figure" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>does not include SNPs from the MHC region and therefore shows only 16). For both type I error and power experiments, we tested the same gene sets as on the real data, except for power, we did not include any gene sets containing SNPs in the V C (those SNPs used to correct for confounding) or within 2 centimorgans of these SNPs, to be sure that the sets were unambiguously true positives. When comparing our LRT approach against a score-based test, we used the same score test as the Sequence Kernel Association Test (SKAT) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Wu et al., 2011</ref>), which uses the Davies method to compute P-values from the null distribution (but here with our FaST-LMM-Set model). This score test has previously been shown to control type I error (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lee et al., 2012b</ref>), consistent with our own findings (not shown).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Linear-time computations</head><p>What remains left to explain is how to achieve the linear-time speedup in the present setting—the case of two random effects. The crux of the cubic to linear-time speedup in the single random effect model was to bypass construction of K and the required spectral decomposition of K by recognizing that one can instead use V and the spectral decomposition of V (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lippert et al., 2011</ref>). We can view the two random-effects model as a single random effect with covariance K 1 À ð ÞK C þ K S. To use the algebraic speed-up just mentioned, we observed that K ¼ VV T , where now</p><formula>V 1 ffiffiffiffi s c p V C 1 À ð Þ 1 2 ; 1 p s s V S 1 2 ! ,</formula><p>using U; W ½  to denote the side-by-side concatenation of matrices U and W. So long as s ¼ s s þ s c 5N, which was true for all of the datasets examined here (and almost all others we have analyzed), we obtained the linear-time computations and memory footprint just as in<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lippert et al. (2011)</ref>. [One might also consider using low rank update equations of the type used in<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Listgarten et al. (2012)</ref>to perform exclusion, although we have not yet implemented this.] Finally, to perform parameter estimation in this two random-effects model, we used an approach similar to that reported in<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lippert et al. (2011)</ref>. That is, we used a 1D Brent search optimization routine to find the value of , which maximized the restricted likelihood. For each call to the restricted likelihood for a particular value of , efficient computations were performed as in (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lippert et al., 2011</ref>), except using the two random effects. of 1.08 is the result of polygenic influence (The Wellcome<ref type="bibr">Trust Case Control, 2007</ref>). Having established that both of our datasets required correction for confounders and that the LMM with our chosen background genetic similarity matrix, K S , sufficiently corrected for confounders, we next applied FaST-LMM-Set, using the same LMM-correcting component as in the univariate test. The full set of results is available for all analyses in Supplementary Table S1. On GAW14, the uncorrected set analysis yielded 241 significant sets, whereas FaST-LMM-Set, which corrects for confounding, yielded none. It is thought that this dataset contains little, if any signal (e.g. based on the univariate analysis). On WTCCC Crohn's disease, an uncorrected set analysis yielded 26 significant sets, whereas FaST-LMM-Set yielded 16 (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>). Next, we investigate these sets in detail. To validate the significant sets recovered on the WTCCC Crohn's phenotype, we used a meta-analysis (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Franke et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Listgarten et al., 2012</ref>). If a set we found as significant was within 50 kilobases of a validated SNP/region, we counted it as a true positive. Additionally, for the genes not validated by the meta-analysis, we conducted a literature search. Detailed validation results are provided in Supplementary Table S1. Using our newly developed method, FaST-LMM-Set, we found 16 significant gene sets, of which all but one were validated by the meta-analysis. The remaining gene, SLC24A4, performs a similar function to the validated gene SLC22A4—both are cation transporters [www.genecards.org (<ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Rebhan et al., 1997)]</ref>—suggesting a promising candidate for follow-up.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DISCUSSION</head><p>We have developed a novel efficient approach for testing sets of genetic markers in the presence of confounding structure such as arises from ethnic diversity and family relatedness within a cohort.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1531</head><p>correct for confounding due to rare variants in a univariate setting (<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Listgarten et al., 2013</ref>). Furthermore, others have already shown that LMM-based set tests work well for detection of sets of associated rare variants (<ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Wu et al., 2011</ref>). It follows that the hybrid approach that we presented here is likely to prove effective in the setting of testing sets of rare variants in the presence of confounders, although this remains to be investigated fully. For example, we have found the use of a linear model on a case– control phenotype to yield inflated tests statistics when testing rare variants. We have demonstrated that our LRT outperforms a score test for our model and setting. This is perhaps unsurprising, given that the score test can be viewed as an approximation to the LRT by a second-order Taylor series expansion (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Buse, 2007</ref>) in the neighbourhood of the null model. Furthermore, given its robust properties, the LRT is considered the benchmark for statistical testing (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Crainiceanu, 2008</ref>). We note, however, that in some recent work (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lin and Tang, 2011</ref>), when testing for rare variants using a logistic fixed effects model, a score test was found to perform better than LRT, which was found to be liberal. Although the best test may depend on context, we note that Lin et al. used a different model than we did and, in particular, did not use a variance component approach. Also, they used closed-form asymptotic-based LRT P-values rather than making use of empirically derived null distributions as we have done here. For many cases of hidden structure in genetic data, the use of principal component-based covariates is sufficient for correction (<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Price et al., 2006</ref>), and thus these covariates could immediately be added to existing models such as SKAT (<ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Wu et al., 2011</ref>) to achieve a set test that corrects for confounding. However, it is now widely accepted that there are various forms of confounders, which cannot be corrected for by principal components, but for which an LMM adequately corrects (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kang et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Price et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Yu et al., 2006</ref>), and it is for these problems that we have developed our approach. We here focused on testing SNPs in a manner similar to SKAT (<ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Wu et al., 2011</ref>). However, it would be straightforward to also adapt FaST-LMM-Set to the approach of SKAT-O, in which the original SKAT model is in effect combined with a collapsingtype approach (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lee et al., 2012a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lee et al., , 2012b</ref>).FaST-LMM-Set denotes our newly developed method; FaST-LMM-Set (uncorrected) is the same but does not correct for confounding with a second variance component.

			<note place="foot" n="3"> RESULTS 3.1 Type I error and power on synthetic data First, we examined whether our LRT approach controlled type I error. As described in Section 2, we generated null-only test statistics by way of permutations on the WTCCC data, obtaining a total of roughly 1 million test statistics. The type I error was controlled (Table 1). Neither (1) fitting the null distribution parameters (to all test statistics) by way of maximum likelihood nor (2) use of a 0:5 2 o : 0:5 2 1 null distribution, yielded calibrated P-values. The first was liberal, whereas the latter was conservative (Table 1). Finally, quantile–quantile plots in Figure 1 additionally demonstrates good calibration over the entire range of P-values from our method, for the same points as in Table 1. Because the score test we used has already been shown to control type I error (Lee et al., 2012b), we do not report on it here, but we did find the same in our own experiments (not shown). Next, we compared the power of our LRT approach to a score test approach (both using the same two random effects model) on synthetic data (see Section 2). Over five synthetic datasets and a range of significance levels, LRT found significantly more sets than the score test (Table 2). Furthermore, on the real WTCCC data, LRT again found significantly more sets (Table 4). 3.2 Application to real data We investigated our new approach on two datasets. The first was the GAW14, which included data from over eight ethnicities and numerous close family members for a total of 1261 individuals. After filtering, there were 7579 SNPs available for analysis. The second dataset was from the WTCCC from which we used 14 925 individuals and 356 441 SNPs in our analysis. We used the Crohn&apos;s phenotypes because this was the one showing the most confounding in an uncorrected analysis. Unlike the WTCCC (The Wellcome Trust Case Control, 2007), we included nonwhite data for individuals and close family members to increase power and because the LMM can treat them properly (Astle and Balding, 2009; Kang et al., 2010; Price et al., 2010). To judge the degree of confounding due to genetic relatedness, and to ensure that our LMM approach could sufficiently correct for confounding, we ran both an uncorrected and corrected univariate analysis on each dataset because this is a well-understood test that has been reported on before. Here, the extent of test statistic inflation owing to unmodelled confounders was assessed using the statistic, also known as the inflation factor from genomic control (Devlin and Roeder, 1999). The value is defined as the ratio of the median observed to median theoretical test statistic. Values of substantially greater than (less than) 1.0 are indicative of inflation (deflation). As can be seen in Table 3, without correction, the test statistics appear to be inflated. Although one might consider GC ¼ 1:08 (seen on the corrected analysis of WTCCC) as still moderately inflated, it has been shown that complex, highly polygenic traits lead to increases in GC (Yang et al., 2011) in the absence of spurious signal. Moreover, the WTCCC themselves reported GC in the range of 1.08–1.11 on removal of individuals from different races and related individuals (neither of which we removed), and also on adjustment with two principal components, suggesting that a GC</note>

			<note place="foot">In the course of our analyses, we noticed that some sets with small P-values had almost no univariate signal in any of the SNPs. In particular, among the 16 sets in the WTCCC data supported by either meta-analysis or literature search, six (C1orf141, SAG, SLC24A4, SLC22A4, TCTA and PTPN2) were missed by the univariate analysis (i.e. an SNP lying within 50 kilobases of any of the regions reported by Frank et al. was not found to be significant). One of the motivations for doing set analysis is to uncover signals for such regions. The intuition here is the same as in a univariate conditional GWAS analysis. That is, conditioning on variables can lead to an increase in power, revealing signal that would be hidden without the conditioning (Atwell et al., 2010; Segura et al., 2012). Thus, the set test acts not only to aggregate weak signal but also to unmask signal hidden by covariates included by virtue of doing a set test. We investigated one such case in detail. In particular, we computed the univariate P-values for each of the 15 SNPs associated with the gene SLC22A4, marginally, as well as conditioned on all the other SNPs in this gene, using an LMM to correct for confounding. This gene was found to be associated with Crohn&apos;s disease using FaST-LMM-Set with P ¼ 7.6 Â 10 À8. The smallest marginal univariate P-value was 1:2 Â 10 À5 , but when we conditioned on the other SNPs in the set, the smallest conditional univariate P-value obtained was 7:0 Â 10 À8. This result demonstrates the increased power afforded by the set test owing to the interplay of SNPs within the gene that is missed by a univariate approach. 3.4 Significance of sets is independent of set size On data with phenotypic association, we expected that there could be correlation between set size and P-value because with a larger set, there could be more predictive SNPs and more power. Furthermore, we expected that when confounders were not properly accounted for in the set analysis, that the more SNPs in a set, the more power the set would have to detect these confounders, and therefore the stronger the correlation between set size and P-value would appear. The correlations on our real data were consistent with these expectations. In particular, we saw no significant correlation for FaST-LMM-Set (which corrects for confounders) but significant correlation when we did not correct for confounders (Table 5). We also expected that on null-only data, when confounders were properly accounted for, the set P-value and set size would be independent. Consistent with this expectation, when we permuted the Crohn&apos;s phenotype to remove signal, the FaSTLMM-Set correlation was reduced to ¼ 0:019 (P ¼ 0.18).</note>

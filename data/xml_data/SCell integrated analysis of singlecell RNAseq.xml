				<p>Analysis of the composition of heterogeneous tissue has been greatly enabled by recent developments in single-cell transcriptomics. We present SCell, an integrated software tool for quality filtering, normalization, feature selection, iterative dimensionality reduction, clustering and the estimation of gene-expression gradients from large ensembles of single-cell RNA-seq datasets. SCell is open source, and implemented with an intuitive graphical interface. Scripts and protocols for the high-throughput pre-processing of large ensembles of single-cell, RNA-seq datasets are provided as an additional resource. Availability and Implementation: Binary executables for Windows, MacOS and Linux are available at</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Single-cell sequencing enables heterogeneity assessments at unprecedented resolution. At a cost comparable to sequencing a sample in bulk, hundreds of single-cell datasets can instead be generated. We present SCell, a software tool to perform outlier filtering, to normalize cell-cycle effects, to select genes for dimensionality reduction and to estimate inter-sample expression gradients. Several groups have proposed reconstructing the gene-expression kinetics of developmental processes from transcriptomics data, by summarizing gene expression along the backbone of a spanning graph of the samples' PCA coordinates (<ref type="bibr">Bendall et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Magwene et al, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Trapnell et al, 2014</ref>). As single-cell sequencing becomes more widely adopted, the large number of available samples makes direct regression of gene expression on PCA coordinates an attractive alternative. SCell can regress/interpolate gene expression on PCA space, visualize expression gradients, and estimate expression kinetics along minimum spanning trees and minimum weight paths. These tools are accessible through an interactive, graphical interface.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Quality control and pre-processing</head><p>To identify outlier libraries, we developed a strategy to estimate genes expressed at background levels in a given sample. We then filter samples whose background fraction is significantly larger than average. Our approach builds on previous methods for sequencing data based on order-statistics (<ref type="bibr">Diaz et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Xu et al., 2010</ref>) (Supplementary Materials M1, Supplementary<ref type="figure">Figure S1A</ref>). In our tests, samples that had a small q-value for our Lorenz-statistic had low complexity, as measured by Gini-Simpson index, and/or they had low coverage, as estimated by the Good-Turing statistic (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Figure S1B</ref>). Moreover, in our data the Lorenz-statistic correlated with the results of live-dead staining (Pearson-correlation 0.74). SCell displays these quality metrics, Gini-Simpson index and user's metadata, including the number of mapped reads and the results of live-dead staining, in an interactive expression profiler (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Figure S1C</ref>). SCell also reports library coverage and marginal-return estimates based on PRESEQ (<ref type="bibr">Daley and Smith, 2014</ref>) (Supplementary Materials M1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Normalization and feature selection</head><p>We extend remove-unwanted-variation using control genes (RUVg) (<ref type="bibr">Risso et al., 2014</ref>) to normalize single-cell data for dimensionality reduction and clustering. RUVg utilizes ordinary-least-squares regression to produce normalized counts, we implement a robust variant: iteratively reweighted least squares with a bisquare weight function (Supplementary methods M2). SCell can produce counts normalized by any combination of: (i) Cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) expression, which corresponds to cell-cycle state, and (ii) a user supplied count matrix. Additionally, SCell utilizes canonical-correlation analysis to correlate cell-cycle and gene expression (Supplementary Materials M2). This estimates the percentage of genome-wide variance explained by cyclin/CDKs, the specific cyclins/CDKs explaining the most variance and genes correlating with cyclin/CDs (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Figure S2A</ref>). By default, SCell normalizes samples by sequencing depth. SCell provides statistics for feature selection. We use a score statistic, from a generalized-Poisson model, to test for gene-wise zeroinflation and identify technical dropouts (Supplementary Materials M2). We use a power function based on the index-of-dispersion to prioritize genes by variability (Supplementary Materials M2). SCell implements an interactive viewer to visualize gene variance versuss sampling (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig S3)</ref>, and to select genes based on these statistics, and their false discovery rates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Dimensionality reduction, clustering and expression kinetics</head><p>SCell implements PCA, and optionally varimax-rotation. Two interactive windows allow the user to explore samples in PCA space, with gene-level and sample-level metadata displayed upon mouseover (<ref type="figure">Fig. S4</ref>). SCell offers several methods for clustering: k-means, Minkowski-weighted k-means (<ref type="bibr">de Amorim, 2012</ref>), Gaussian mixture model, the clustering 'with scatter' algorithm DBSCAN and user-defined clusters. Genes and samples can be added by cluster or individually to user-defined gene and sample lists. A PCA can be recomputed at any time from the user's sample list, enabling 'iterative' PCA learning of population sub-structure. SCell implements minimum-spanning-tree (MST) and Gabriel graph minimum-cost paths, for semi-supervised estimation of cell-state transitions (Supplementary Materials M3). SCell automatically fits loess/lowess regressions, as well as several interpolation types (linear, cubic spline, biharmonic and thin-plate spline) on gene expression in PCA space. This allows users to visualize expression gradients, and evaluate gene-expression kinetics along MST and minimum-cost paths. To illustrate, we performed quality filtering, feature selection and clustering on 96 cells sequenced from gestational-week 10 human fetal neocortex, 258 cells from gestational-weeks 16–18, human fetal neocortex (Supplementary Materials M4, dbGaP phs000989. v3.p1), as well as 393 cells previously published from gestationalweek 16-18 human fetal neocortex (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Figure S4B</ref>, dbGaP phs000989.v1.p1). We identified 501 cells which passed quality control at a Lorenz-statistic q-value cutoff of q ¼ 0.05. 2169 genes were chosen for dimensionality reduction, based on a zero-inflation q-value of 0.1 (to control for under-sampling) and an indexor-dispersion power of 90% (to enrich for variable genes). We identified clusters expressing markers of interneurons and these could be distinguished from cells of the excitatory-neuronal lineage. Iterative PCA analysis of the interneurons identified sub-clusters expressing markers of different classes of inhibitory neurons (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Figure S4B</ref>and C). Lowess regression, along a Gabriel-graph shortest path of the excitatory-neuronal lineage, predicts a rapid decline in markers of neural stem cells, a gradual increase in neuronal markers and a transient spike in markers of intermediate-progenitors along pseudo-time (<ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>).</p></div>

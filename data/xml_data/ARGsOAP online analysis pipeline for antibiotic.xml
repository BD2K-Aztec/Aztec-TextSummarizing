				<p>Motivation: Environmental dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) has become an increasing concern for public health. Metagenomics approaches can effectively detect broad profiles of ARGs in environmental samples; however, the detection and subsequent classification of ARG-like sequences are time consuming and have been severe obstacles in employing metagenomic methods. We sought to accelerate quantification of ARGs in metagenomic data from environmental samples. Results: A Structured ARG reference database (SARG) was constructed by integrating ARDB and CARD, the two most commonly used databases. SARG was curated to remove redundant sequences and optimized to facilitate query sequence identification by similarity. A database with a hierarchical structure (type-subtype-reference sequence) was then constructed to facilitate classification (assigning ARG-like sequence to type, subtype and reference sequence) of sequences identified through similarity search. Utilizing SARG and a previously proposed hybrid functional gene annotation pipeline, we developed an online pipeline called ARGs-OAP for fast annotation and classification of ARG-like sequences from metagenomic data. We also evaluated and proposed a set of criteria important for efficiently conducting metagenomic analysis of ARGs using ARGs-OAP. Availability and Implementation: Perl script for ARGs-OAP can be downloaded from https://github. com/biofuture/Ublastx_stageone. ARGs-OAP can be accessed through http://smile.hku.hk/SARGs.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and the escalating threats they pose to public health have attracted worldwide concern (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Laxminarayan et al., 2013</ref>). A growing number of organizations and governments have enhanced their monitoring of antibiotic resistant bacteria and ARGs. The World Health Organization (2014) initiated a global surveillance of antibiotic resistance in 114 countries, with their first surveillance report released in April 2014; the Public Health Agency of Canada also provided a 4-year surveillance report on antibiotic resistant organisms in<ref type="bibr">Canada (2014)</ref>released a note titled 'Antibiotic resistance in the environment' (2013) and the U.S. White House issued an executive order on national strategy (2014) for combating antibiotic resistance. Along with concerns about antibiotic resistance in clinical settings, there has been increased interest in ARGs in the environment. ARGs have been detected in soil (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Cytryn, 2013</ref>), natural waters (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Pruden et al., 2012</ref>) and sediments (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Chen et al., 2013</ref>), where they are potentially transferable from host bacteria to pathogens by horizontal gene transfer (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Davies, 1994</ref>). ARGs are now regarded as emerging pollutants (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Pruden et al., 2006</ref>) and their dissemination in the environment has attracted much media attention. Recently, metagenomic approaches have been applied to the investigation of ARGs in environmental samples.<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Nesme et al. (2014)</ref>studied the occurrence and abundance of ARGs in 71 environmental samples. Their results revealed the diversity and abundance of ARGs in different environments and suggested these genes were not randomly distributed. A study by<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Li et al. (2015)</ref>showed the influence of anthropogenic activities on the distribution of ARGs in 50 samples from 10 different environments. Through network analysis, they proposed tetM and genes coding aminoglycoside resistance as indicators that can be used to quantify other co-occurring ARGs. A more comprehensive investigation of the diversity and abundance of ARGs in various environments would provide insight into the distribution pattern of ARGs, the influence of human activity and the effectiveness of intervention or stewardship programs. Any large-scale environmental analysis for ARGs by metagenomic sequencing of environmental samples requires an appropriate analysis method as well as a reference database. Several databases and analysis pipelines have been constructed specifically for ARG analysis, such as the Antibiotic Resistance Genes Database (ARDB) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Liu and Pop, 2009</ref>), the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">McArthur et al., 2013</ref>), ResFinder (<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Zankari et al., 2012</ref>), Antibiotic Resistance Gene Online (ARGO) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Scaria et al., 2005</ref>) and ARG-ANNOT (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Gupta et al., 2013</ref>). ARGO focuses on vancomycin and beta-lactam resistance genes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Scaria et al., 2005</ref>) while ARG-ANNOT was designed to detect ARGs in bacterial genomes instead of environmental samples. ResFinder offers ARG detection functions but needs longer query reads. For a sequence to be detected as an ARG in ResFinder, it must cover at least two-fifths of the length of the matching ARG in the database with no less than 50% identity (<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Zankari et al., 2012</ref>). ARDB and CARD together provide most of the publicly available ARG sequences. They are the two most commonly used reference databases in the investigation of ARGs in environmental samples (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Gibson et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Kristiansson et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ma et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Yang et al., 2013</ref>). Nevertheless, ARDB and CARD provide only limited online analysis capabilities for metagenomic data. Moreover, neither database can provide detailed ARG profiles for environmental samples, i.e. classifications of the identified ARGs-like sequences and abundance information for each detected ARG type/subtype, which makes it difficult for users to interpret the search results from the huge metagenomic data. Here we describe our efforts in developing a Structured ARG database (SARG) by integrating sequences from ARDB and CARD in a hierarchical structure (type-subtype-reference sequence). Using SARG, ARG-like sequences obtained from similarity searches can be automatically assigned into different types and subtypes, avoiding tedious manual classification. Furthermore, an online analysis pipeline (ARGs-OAP) is available using SARG. This pipeline allows users to determine ARG profiles from large numbers of environmental samples in a single run. The pipeline aims to exploit the power of metagenomic analysis for better understanding the distribution and dissemination of ARGs in different environments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Optimizing the integrated database from ARDB and CARD</head><p>The procedure for the optimization and construction of the integrated ARG database is summarized in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. Protein sequences were downloaded from CARD (http://arpcard.mcmaster.ca/, version on 15 April 2014) and ARDB (http://ardb.cbcb.umd.edu/index. html, version 1.1). The downloaded CARD database contained 2513 sequences while the ARDB database contained 7828 sequences. Only a small portion of sequences were shared by the two databases (586 sequences from ARDB and CARD with redundant sequences removed). Details of the identification of shared sequences process are in SI. The ARDB and CARD databases were first examined to remove non-ARG sequences (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table  S1</ref>). The two databases were integrated and redundant sequences were identified with a custom Perl script (SI). Redundant sequences were defined as sequences with 100% identity for the complete protein sequences. Each redundant group was manually inspected and the sequence with the most representative description was retained. By removing the redundant sequences, the size of the integrated database was reduced by 57% (from 10 337 sequences to 4401 sequences). The slimmed database was further examined to remove those ARG sequences related to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), according to the updated CARD database. Moreover, sequences with description of 'hypothetical protein' or 'unnamed protein' were removed to ensure accurate and informative annotation of ARG-like sequences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Construction and validation of SARG</head><p>Unlike the analysis of microbial communities or metabolic pathways, post-alignment analyses of ARG-like sequences from metagenomic data usually require significant error-prone manual work, mainly due to the need to sort ARG-like sequences into different types/subtypes in order to measure subtype abundance. Resistance 'Types' represent the class of antibiotics to which ARGs confer resistance, such as Type 'tetracycline resistance genes' or Type 'sulfonamide resistance genes'. Resistance 'Subtypes' representARGs-OAPindividual kinds of ARGs, such as subtype 'tetA' of 'tetracycline resistance genes' or subtype 'sul1' of 'sulfonamide resistance genes'. The idea for a structured database had been proposed in previous studies (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ma et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Yang et al., 2013</ref>) to facilitate classification of ARG-like sequences, with a hierarchical structure based on the concept of 'Types' and 'Subtypes'. The preliminary classification of different ARG types/subtypes in SARG was done based on sequence description through both keyword search and manual examination. In the present study, we adapted the classification of ARG 'Types' and 'Subtypes' from the previous structured ARDB and CARD. We first used the names of ARG subtypes as keyword to search the annotation of ARG sequences from the integrated database. The matched sequences were extracted and filed under the subtype's name in fasta format. We then checked these files one by one manually to ensure the correct classification of ARG sequences. The structure of the integrated database was also renewed from the updated information of ARG types and subtypes through literature search. The classification was further validated by sequence similarity. Potential problematic sequences (potential misplaced sequences) were identified through both direct BLASTP alignment and distance calculation. These problematic sequences were aligned with NCBINR database and the final classification of the problematic sequences was done according to the validated hits from NCBI-NR annotation. Our process of validation is further explained in SI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Evaluation of similarity search method in ARG detection</head><p>The similarity search method outlined above was evaluated using the ARG sequences and non-ARG sequences from Swiss-Prot as test sequences (SI). The sequences from Swiss-Prot were enumerated into overlapping substrings (kmer) of different lengths, including 33 amino acids (aa), 50 aa, 67 aa and 100 aa, to mimic reads from Illumina high throughput sequencing (100, 150, 200 and 300 bp). These simulated sequences were annotated using ARGs-OAP. Ratios of false-positive, false-negative and cross-talking results were calculated at different E-value cutoffs, sequence identity and hit length. Using a specific cutoff, a read from the ARG set was counted as 'true positive (TP)' if it was correctly annotated to ARG (type or subtype) or 'false negative (FN)' if it was annotated as non-ARG sequence; a read from non-ARG set was defined as 'false positive (FP)' if it was annotated as ARG and 'true negative (TN)' if it does not match any sequence in the database at the specific cutoff. In cases where ARG reads were mistakenly annotated as a different ARG subtype, these reads were labeled as 'cross talking' (CT). The Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Matthews, 1975</ref>) was used to measure the effectiveness of the method on all tested values for E-value, identity and hit length. Two other criteria, sensitivity and precision, were also used to assess the performance of the method. Details for these measurements are summarized in SI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Development of ARGs-OAP</head><p>ARGs-OAP was developed to facilitate the analysis of ARG sequences from metagenomic data, utilizing SARG and the Galaxy web server (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Goecks et al., 2010</ref>) with an intuitive user interface. There are two parts of ARGs-OAP (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>): a pre-screening of potential ARG sequences using the user's local computers to reduce the size of sequence files for uploading followed by online annotation/ classification of ARG sequences using a web-based platform. Before uploading metagenomic sequences to the online Galaxy based analysis platform (http://smile.hku.hk/SARGs), it is recommended to perform a local pre-screening for ARG-like and 16S rRNA gene sequences using UBLAST through the supplied Perl script (the script package can be downloaded from https://github.com/biofuture/ Ublastx_stageone). This fast pre-screening was designed to remove irrelevant sequences which usually account for &gt;99.3% of total sequences (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Yang et al., 2014</ref>), thus significantly reducing the size of file for uploading and accelerating the BLASTX analysis on the webbased platform. The potential ARG sequences uploaded to the webbased platform are aligned against SARG using BLASTX and classified according to the SARG hierarchy. The abundance of ARGs in the metagenomic data can be normalized to the ARG reference sequence length (nucleotide) and the number of 16S rRNA genes using the following equation from our previous study (Eq. 1) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Li et al., 2015</ref>):</p><formula>Abundance ¼ X n 1</formula><p>N ARGÀlike sequence Â L reads =L ARG reference sequence N 16S sequence Â L reads =L 16S sequence</p><formula>(1)</formula><p>where N ARG-like sequence is the number of the ARG-like sequences annotated to one specific ARG reference sequence; L reads represents the length of the reads; L ARG reference sequence is the nucleotide sequence length of the correspondingly specific ARG reference sequence; N 16S sequence is the number of the 16S rRNA gene sequences; L 16S sequence is the full length of 16S rRNA gene, i.e. 1432 bp in the present study; n is the number of mapped ARG reference sequences belonging to the ARG type or subtype. This normalized result avoids bias due to different prokaryotic DNA portions in environmental samples and is comparable to qPCR results normalized against the number of 16S rRNA genes. The abundance of ARGs in the metagenomic data, which has been widely used in previous studies, could also be normalized against the ARG reference sequences length and the cell numbers from the metagenomic datasets using the web-based platform (Eq. 2). Cell numbers are estimated by retrieving microbial community identified by 16S rRNA gene hypervariable region from metagenomics data by USEARCH, calculating the average 16S rRNA gene copy number by copy number information according to CopyRighter database (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Angly et al., 2014</ref>) with abundance of each taxon as the weight, and finally dividing the total number of 16S rRNA gene sequences (converted to full sequence) by 16S rRNA gene average copy number to get the cell number (Eq. 3). Cell number is the estimated number of prokaryotic cells of the metagenomics dataset. Reads with hit length coverage of the databasehypervariable region lower than 50% are excluded. The searching criteria of USEARCH are-query_cov 0.2-target_cov 0.5-id 0.9. The equations used in this normalization process are:In Eq. 3 for cell number calculation, m represents the total taxa detected from metagenomics dataset according to extracted hyper variable region information; a i is the number of aligned hypervariable sequences of taxon i in the metagenomics datas set; A is total number of aligned hypervariable sequences of all the m taxa and M i represents the copy number of taxon i from CopyRighter database. Details of cell number estimation from metagenomics data can be referred to UBLAST wiki document on ARGs-OAP (https:// github.com/biofuture/Ublastx_stageone/wiki/Transform-ARGsabundance-against-cell-number). We also evaluated the effectiveness of cell number estimation by metagenomics simulation datasets (SI).</p><formula>Abundance ¼ X n 1</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Overview of the database</head><p>After classification and validation of all the sequences, the SARG comprises of 23 ARG types, 1227 ARG subtypes and 4246 reference sequences (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>; Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S2</ref>). The number of reference sequences in each ARG type and subtype are listed in Supplementary Tables S2 and S3. Over 72% of the 1227 ARG subtypes belong to the beta-lactam resistance type (887 subtypes), although in total, the beta-lactam resistance subtypes account for only about 35% (1497) sequences in SARG. Following the beta-lactam resistance type, multidrug (935 sequences) and aminoglycoside (275 sequences) resistance types are additional major types in this database (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Evaluation of ARGs-OAP for ARG annotation using simulated datasets</head><p>The effects of database completeness, cutoffs used for BLASTX (i.e. E-value, identity and hit length) and sequence length were investigated for their influences on the annotation of ARG sequences. To evaluate the influence of the database completeness on sequence annotation, two simulated datasets were used. Simulated Dataset 1 contained ARG sequences which were included in the integrated ARG database as well as some non-ARG sequences. Simulated Dataset 2 contained sequences from Simulated Dataset 1 and some ARG sequences in Swiss-Prot which were not included in the integrated ARG database. For Simulated Dataset 1, SARG was a complete reference database. While for Simulated Dataset 2, SARG was incomplete. Results showed that if the test data contained new ARGs sequences (Simulated Dataset 2), MCC values dropped significantly when the identity cutoff was set higher than 60% (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4a</ref>and b). Sensitivity was also reduced dramatically at this cutoff level (Figs 4d and 4e). However, the incompleteness of the database had little influence on the annotation precision (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4g and h</ref>). The effects of E-value and identity on these three evaluation indices are also shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>. The MCC value and precision increased with decreasing E-value but sensitivity did not change much. On the other hand, identity showed more impact compared to E-value. Under the cutoff usually applied in metagenomic analysis using short reads in previous ARGs studies (E-value of 1e-5 and identity of 90%) as shown by the blue arrow in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>, MCC value and sensitivity were low for ARG annotation, indicating the false-negative rate was high and many ARG-like sequences were missed. To reveal a more comprehensive profile of ARGs using this similarity search method, the recommended cutoff is 60% for identity and 1e-7 for E-value, as indicated by the red arrow, based on MCC results as shown using Simulated Dataset 2. The effect of hit length was investigated using the E-value 1e-7 and identity 60% cutoffs. Results showed that change in hit lengthARGs-OAPhad little influence on sensitivity and MCC value for hit length shorter than 85% of sequence length. But sensitivity and MCC value dropped drastically when hit length increased from 85 to 100% (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. S1</ref>), indicating a more stringent hit length would miss more ARGs-like sequences. Since the current sequencing platforms can generate reads with different lengths, the effect of sequence length was also evaluated.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3b</ref>, 3c and Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure S2</ref>show that longer read lengths resulted in higher MCC and sensitivity. In addition, the effect of identity on annotation between ARG type and subtype is shown in Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure S3</ref>. Generally, the MCC value, sensitivity and precision were higher at ARG type level than at subtype level (Supplementary Tables S4–S6). We assessed cross-talk ratios with different criteria using Simulated Dataset 2. The number of reads which were wrongly assigned to another subtype/type was counted and the fraction of these reads in the total dataset was calculated as the cross-talk ratio. The cross-talk ratio was 1.2 6 0.15% at the subtype level and 0.19 6 0.21% at the type level for Simulated Dataset 2 of 300 bp reads. The effect of identity, E-value and read length were evaluated (Supplementary Figs S4–S7). Longer read length, higher identity and lower E-value lowered the crosstalk ratios. Overall, the cross-talk ratios were very low with none exceeding 2 and 3% on type and subtype levels respectively for all simulated datasets. In summary, this similarity search method achieved satisfactory results using proper hit cutoffs. Not surprisingly, longer query sequences improved annotation accuracy while the completeness of the reference database has a significant impact on annotation result. Of the hit cutoff variables applied during similarity search, hit length had little impact on annotation result when it was below 85% of the sequence length, while sensitivity and MCC decreased as hit length increased over 85%. An E-value of 1e-7 and identity of 60% were found to be the most suitable criteria considering MCC value, sensitivity and precision for ARG annotation using the current version of SARG. Cross-talk between different types was only a few at the recommended identity and E-value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">ARGs-OAP for annotation of ARGs in metagenomics datasets</head><p>As previously mentioned, the first step is pre-screening of potential ARGs sequences from metagenomic datasets using UBLAST on the user's local computer, followed by a second step of sequence annotation and classification using the online analysis platform after uploading identified potential ARGs sequences (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Yang et al., 2014</ref>). This pipeline supports multiple sample analysis, and generates a general table of ARG abundances (expressed as 'copies of ARG per copy of 16S rRNA gene' and 'copies of ARG per prokaryote's cell') which are normalized to the length of the corresponding ARG reference sequence as well as to the number of 16S rRNA genes and cells in the metagenomic data for better comparison to other studies (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Li et al., 2015</ref>). Analysis results are summarized in files which can be downloaded from the web-based platform, including (1) ARGs abundance of all uploaded samples normalized to 16S rRNA gene number at type, subtype level with other selected reference metagenomic datasets; (2) ARGs abundance normalized to cell numbers tables like (1); (3) and (4) PCoA figures for user uploaded samples and the reference datasets at subtype level. The reference metagenomic datasets adopted from<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Li et al., (2015)</ref>include different environmental samples with various ARG abundances, which could be used to make a general comparison of ARG abundances between the user's datasets and other previous published metagenomic datasets. ARGs-OAP also provides a general Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) using the uploaded datasets of user's samples and reference datasets. PCoA figures could be downloaded in PDF format. Examples of the output results are shown in Supplementary Table S7–S9 and<ref type="figure">Figure S9</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Time requirements</head><p>Time consumed in the first step of ARGs detection from metagenomic data using ARGs-OAP was evaluated using three kinds of samples with data size of 10 million reads (100 bp) each, including metagenomic data from chicken faeces, activated sludge and sediment, which cover the common range of ARG abundances. The time required for pre-screening of potential ARGs and 16S rRNA genes ranged from 105 to 124 min (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#tab_0">Table S10</ref>) for processing the 10 million reads in each dataset using the 64 bit version of UBLAST and 1 thread on a local computer (Lenovo ThinkStation-D20: CPU 2.40 GHz Â 8 cores; Memory 96 GB). A file containing about 307 thousand potential ARG-like reads in total was generated from the three datasets through our supplied script, in which the number of sequences were significantly reduced from 30 million reads in the original datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p>The time required for the similarity search and the post-alignment analysis has become the limiting factor in metagenomic studies as sequencing costs decrease and data sizes grow (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Mardis, 2011</ref>). The major goal of the present study was to provide an online platform to shorten the time required for the detection of ARGs and to improve the classification and enumeration of ARG-like sequences by constructing a structured database. First, after removing redundant sequences, the ARDB and CARD databases were integrated to provide more comprehensive detection of ARG-like sequences in metagenomic data, which will increase the accuracy and completeness of ARG profiles from environmental samples with diverse microbial communities. Since the search time is dependent on the size of reference database, removing redundant sequences in the two reference databases was an obvious way to reduce the search time without compromising the completeness of the reference database. Second, a structured database was established for the integrated database following our previous idea of a structured ARDB (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Yang et al., 2013</ref>). This structured database made automatic classification of different ARG types and subtypes possible, therefore manual classification is no longer needed. Third, the online analysis platform, ARGs-OAP, was developed for ARG detection applying our previous proposed hybrid approach using UBLAST and BLASTX for ARG annotation of metagenomic sequence data (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Yang et al., 2014</ref>). The pre-screening of potential ARG sequences could filter out most (for ARGs, more than 99.3%) irrelevant sequences and significantly shorten the required time for the BLASTX process on the online platform. Moreover, the classification of the identified ARG-like sequences was conducted automatically using SARG, which will greatly reduce the required time for post-alignment processing, and automatic generation of PCoA from ARGs-OAP may help users with a rapid assessment of differences between the ARG profiles in their samples and in other reference environmental samples. Given the less-biased nature of metagenomic datasets, utilizing the ARGs-OAP, different research groups may compare their datasets in a way that is more consistent than other current approaches, and that can help reveal the distribution of ARGs in different environments. ARGs-OAP also supports analysis under different criteria (i.e. Evalue, hit length and identity). If the user wishes, these criteria can be adjusted according to their specific requirements via a platform interface instead of using the default setting, i.e. E-value of 1e-7, hit length of 75% of read length (i.e. 25 aa for reads of 100 bp) and identity of 80%. Our evaluation indicates that the completeness of the database is critical for the comprehensive annotation of ARGs in metagenomic data by similarity search. It is likely that inclusion of additional novel ARG sequences would improve performance. The current database of SARG was constructed from the two most widely applied databases, i.e. ARDB and CARD (Version on 15 April 2014). It is clear that our integrated structured database does not cover all ARG sequences, although it already contains most ARG sequences available in public database. Thus, as for other gene types, updates with new sequences will be important, as they become available. Moreover, annotation evaluation should be repeated when new ARGs sequences are added in the database to achieve accurate annotation for the ARGs profiles in metagenomic data. We believe this pipeline is a powerful method for more comprehensive ARG profiles assessment from metagenomic data, and hence lead to methods to reduce ARG dissemination to the environment and its dissemination to pathogens.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig.1.</head><figDesc>Fig. 1.

				<p>Motivation: The recognition of translation initiation sites and stop codons is a fundamental part of any gene recognition program. Currently, the most successful methods use powerful classifiers, such as support vector machines with various string kernels. These methods all use two classes, one of positive instances and another one of negative instances that are constructed using sequences from the whole genome. However, the features of the negative sequences differ depending on the position of the negative samples in the gene. There are differences depending on whether they are from exons, introns, intergenic regions or any other functional part of the genome. Thus, the positive class is fairly homogeneous, as all its sequences come from the same part of the gene, but the negative class is composed of different instances. The classifier suffers from this problem. In this article, we propose the training of different classifiers with different negative, more homogeneous, classes and the combination of these classifiers for improved accuracy. Results: The proposed method achieves better accuracy than the best state-of-the-art method, both in terms of the geometric mean of the specificity and sensitivity and the area under the receiver operating characteristic and precision recall curves. The method is tested on the whole human genome. The results for recognizing both translation initiation sites and stop codons indicated improvements in the rates of both false-negative results (FN) and false-positive results (FP). On an average, for translation initiation site recognition, the false-negative ratio was reduced by 30.2% and the FP ratio decreased by 10.9%. For stop codon prediction, FP were reduced by 41.4% and FN by 31.7%. Availability and implementation: The source code is licensed under the General Public License and is thus freely available.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The recognition of translation initiation sites (TISs) and stop codons (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Zien et al., 2000</ref>) is one of the most critical tasks for gene structure prediction. Most successful current gene recognizers first implement a step of site recognition (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Gross et al., 2007</ref>), which is followed by a process of combining the sites into meaningful gene structures. This first step is of the utmost importance because the program cannot find genes whose functional sites are not identified. Furthermore, a large number ofFP results might inundate the second step of the programs, making it difficult to predict accurate gene structures. The best current approaches use powerful classifiers, namely support vector machines (SVMs), and moderately large sequences around the functional site (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baten et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Degroeve et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Sonnenburg et al., 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, Zien et al., 2000</ref>). In accordance with common practices in machine learning, these methods construct a positive instance set using sequences that contain true TISs or stop codons and a negative instance set; in the negative instance set, the sequences centered around an ATG triplet are not TISs, and the sequences centered around TAG, TAA or TGA triplets are not stop codons. The negative sequences are obtained from all the available information or are randomly selected when sampling is used (<ref type="bibr">Garc Ä±aPedrajas et al., 2012</ref>). Thus, negative sequences can be part of intergenic regions, introns, exons, UTRs, etc. However, the negative sequences from these different regions have different features. Therefore, the negative class, which the classifier must learn, is highly non-homogeneous. This inhomogeneity is an unnecessary difficulty that the learning algorithm must face and that might damage its performance. In this article, we show how the performance of the classifier can be actually improved if the negative instances are divided into different classes based on their position in the gene; subsequently, different classifiers are learned for each pair of positive and negative instance sets. Some previous works have also considered the idea of differentiating between functional sites before proceeding to their recognition. TriTISA (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hu et al., 2009</ref>) is a method for detecting TISs in microbial genomes that classifies all candidate TISs into three categories based on evolutionary properties, and characterizes them in terms of Markov models. Also, other methods (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Burge and Karlin, 1997</ref>) have developed different models depending on the structure and composition of the sequences to recognize. However, these approaches are different from ours, as these models are trained and used separately instead of combined as in our proposal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">APPROACH</head><p>As explained in the previous section, our approach is based on separating the negative sequences based on their position in the gene. The same methodology was used for TIS and stop *To whom correspondence should be addressed. codon recognition. Thus, five different sets are created. First, we create a set containing all sequences that contain positive instances. Then, four additional sets are created containing negative sequences; these sets vary based on the position in the gene of those negative sequences. One set was created for each of the three following types of sequences: exons, introns and intergenic regions. A fourth set of negative sequences was created using sequences from non-coding regions, that is, from introns and intergenic regions together. As stated, the aim of this partitioning of the negative set is to obtain more homogeneous negative sets. In the second step, we must decide how to use these five sets of instances. A straightforward approach would be to use any classifier that can handle more than two classes. However, as mentioned, SVMs are the best performing classifiers for both TIS and stop codon prediction. Although multi-class methods have been developed for SVMs (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Hsu and Lin, 2002</ref>), two-class approaches usually outperform those methods (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Rifkin and Klautau, 2004</ref>). Thus, we chose to train four different classifiers, with each classifier trained to differentiate between the positive class and one of the four different negative classes. This approach has the additional advantage that overwhelming evidence in the machine learning literature indicates that a combination of different learners frequently outperforms methods using only one classifier (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Rokach, 2009</ref>). Additionally, we use another method in our approach. This last method is the stop codon method. This method is chosen because it only uses positive sequences; thus, it is not affected by the problem of mixing in the different instances of the negative classes. The stop codon method (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Saeys et al., 2007</ref>) looks at either the stop codon frequencies downstream of the TIS for TIS recognition or the stop codon frequencies upstream of the actual stop codon for stop codon recognition. After these two steps, we have five trained classifiers that must be combined to obtain a single value that tells us whether a certain sequence is a true site. To classify a new sequence, we obtain the output of each classifier and use those five outputs to predict the class of the sequence. There are many ways of combining the outputs of different classifiers (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Kuncheva, 2002</ref>), some with high complexity. However, in most cases, simple methods are not beaten by the most complex ones, and these simple methods are faster and less prone to over-fitting. The most common of these simple methods include the sum of the outputs, majority voting and the maximum output. Given the outputs of the five classifiers, c 1 ,. .. ,c 5 , and a threshold for each one of these classifiers, t 1 ,. .. ,t 5 , the final answer of the classifier, CÃ°xÃ, for a given sequence x, is defined as follows. For the sum of outputs, the final answer is given by the following equation:</p><formula>CÃ°xÃ= X i c i Ã°xÃ Ã t i : Ã°1Ã</formula><p>The threshold term, t i , corrects for the different ranges of the classifiers. The majority voting approach is given by the following equation:</p><formula>CÃ°xÃ=arg max y2fÃ1;+1g X y:ciÃ°xÃ=y 1: Ã°2Ã</formula><p>Finally, the maximum is given by the following equation:</p><p>CÃ°xÃ=c i Ã°xÃ : i=arg max j jc j Ã°xÃ Ã t j j: Ã°3Ã Once CÃ°xÃ is obtained by any of these methods, a general threshold T should be fixed to decide whether a certain sequence is an actual site. One of the problems we have when choosing the combination method is model selection, as we do not know a priori whether any of the three methods would be consistently better than the other two for all the chromosomes and all the three evaluation measures we used as performance measures. Thus, the best combination was chosen for each case using cross-validation. This cross-validation method is explained in the next section. As a final remark, we should note that our approach is also general enough to be used with any other classifier. Because this approach is based on modifying the number of classifiers and the training sets, it can be used with any other classification method. Furthermore, this method can also be applied if a classifier uses other types of data besides the raw sequence if the information used by the classifier is extracted using the datasets described above. computational complexity. We will refer throughout the article to the SVM with WD kernels as SVMWD. The same WD kernel was used for the classifiers in our proposal. However, we must bear in mind that our method, as it works on the design of the datasets, can be used with any other classification method. Another key parameter of the learning process is the window around the functional site that is used to train the classifiers. A further advantage of our approach is that it allows the use of a suitable window for each type of sequence. The value of the window for each classifier was obtained by cross-validation. We, considering the site as offset 0, and did not count the TIS or the stop codon, and we tested the performance of the following windows:<ref type="bibr">[</ref><ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr">100]</ref>. For each trained classifier, the best window was chosen.<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>shows the window obtained by cross-validation for all the classifiers. For the stop codon method, we used the additional window values of<ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr">200]</ref>,<ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr">300]</ref>,<ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr">400]</ref>and<ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr">500]</ref>for TIS recognition and the window values of<ref type="bibr">[â200, 0]</ref>,<ref type="bibr">[â300, 0]</ref>,<ref type="bibr">[â400, 0]</ref>and<ref type="bibr">[â500, 0]</ref>for stop codon recognition.<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>shows interesting results. First, the window for TIS recognition depended on the classifier and the chromosome. However, the window for stop codon prediction was the same for all cases with only one exception. Second, this table also shows that the different classifiers used for TIS recognition had different values; this finding supports our previous claim that using different classifiers has the advantage of allowing better fine-tuning of the learning parameters. Furthermore, SVMs are sensitive to the learning parameters; thus, we also performed a cross-validation to obtain their values. The WD kernel has two parameters: the standard C parameter of any SVM and the window width of the string kernel. We tested values of 1, 10, 100 and 1000 for C and 12 and 24 for the window width. All eight combinations were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation, and the best one was chosen. Although it may be argued that this method might result in suboptimal parameters, this method is a good compromise between the performance of the SVM and the high computational cost of evaluating each set of parameters. This same procedure was used for both SVMWD and our approach. For training the models, we used random undersampling (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hulse et al., 2010</ref>) because previous studies have shown its usefulness for TIS recognition (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Garc Ä±a-Pedrajas et al., 2012</ref>). For random undersampling, we used a ratio of 1, which means that the majority class was randomly undersampled until both classes had the same number of instances. To evaluate the obtained classifiers, we used the standard measures for imbalanced data. Given the number of true-positive results (TP), falsepositive results (FP), true-negative results (TN) and false-negative results (FN), we used the sensitivity, Sn= TP TP+FN , and the specificity, Sp= TN TN+FP. The geometric mean of these two measures, G Ã mean= ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi Sp Ã Sn p , will be our first classification metric. As a second measure, we used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auROC). However, auROC is independent of class ratios and it can be less meaningful when we have unbalanced datasets (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Sonnenburg et al., 2007</ref>). In such cases, area under the precision recall curve (auPRC) can be used. This measure is specially relevant if we are mainly interested in the positive class. However, it can be sensible for subsampling. In our results, we use all the positive and negative instances for each one of the five chromosomes tested, so no subsampling is used. This also yields to small auPRC values. We use these three metrics because they provide two different views of the performance of the classifiers. The auROC and auPRC values describe the general behavior of the classifier. However, when used in practice, we must establish a threshold for the classification of a query pattern. G-mean provides the required snapshot of the performance of the classifier when we set the needed threshold.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>The first step of our experiments was devoted to studying the usefulness of the five different classifiers that we considered. As stated, we have five classifiers that are trained with the same positive class, and a negative class consisting on negative instances from exons, introns, intergenic regions and non-coding regions. We had a fifth classifier using only positive instances. Thus, we tested the performance, as measured by the auROC, of the combined approach with all five classifiers and then removed one classifier at a time. A negative value means that the classifier had a negative effect on the performance of the model and thus should not be used. The results showed that the worst performing classifier was the one trained using negative instances extracted from exons. For this classifier, the positive and negative instances were the most similar; thus, the training algorithm had more difficulties in differentiating between the positive and negative instances. In fact, the overall effect of this classifier was harmful to the performance of the method. Thus, this classifier was removed and was not considered in the subsequent experiments.Random undersampling was used for training; thus, the number of negative instances was equal to the number of positive instances.The window obtained around the functional site is shown for each classifier.The results also showed that the stop codon method classifier had the most important contribution. This finding is interesting because this classifier was the worst when considered alone. The explanation for this difference may be found in the behavior of the ensembles of classifiers. It is well known (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Kuncheva and Whitaker, 2003</ref>) that a diverse ensemble of classifiers improves the performance of the set of classifiers. The stop codon method differs from the other four classifiers, which are all based on SVMs; thus, although its performance is worse than the performance of those four classifiers individually, the diversity it introduces improves the performance of the set of classifiers. The next step was the comparison of the performances of our approach and SVMWD. A summary of the results for TIS recognition of the five studied chromosomes is shown in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>. The first interesting result is that the proposed approach beat SVMWD for all measures and all chromosomes with only one exception. The improvements in specificity, sensitivity, geometric mean, auROC and auPRC are shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 1</ref>. The second remarkable result shown in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>is the significant reduction in the FN rate. The reduction in the number of FN was 9.3% in the worst case and 44.5% in the best case. This reduction means that 284 TISs that were inaccurately classified as negatives by SVMWD were correctly identified by our method. Most current gene recognizers rely heavily on the classification of TISs; therefore, it is likely that those genes would be completely missed by any gene recognizer. Thus, our approach has the potential to improve the accuracy of any annotation system by 6.4%. Furthermore, our method was also able to improve the truenegative rate. In total, 145 780 FP from SVMWD were correctly classified as negatives using our approach. Therefore, any annotation system that uses our metric would have a significantly reduced set of putative TISs and better expected performance. The improvement for auROC and auPRC values are also shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 1</ref>(We always performed the testing of all the methods with all the negative samples. That means that the ratio minority/majority class is almost 1:11 000 for the worst case yielding to low auPRC values. We must take into account that with only a few thousand FP among several millions of TN we would obtain a low precision value. The situation for stop codon recognition is even worse as the number of TN is multiplied by three). The actual ROC and PRC curves are shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures 2</ref>â6. These figures show that our approach improved the auROCThe table shows the specificity (Sp), sensitivity (Sn),TP, TN, FN, FP and area under the ROC and PRC curves (auROC/PRC) for both methods and the five studied chromosomes.and auPRC for all five studied chromosomes. These results demonstrate that the overall performance of the proposed method was better than the performance of SVMWD. The actual ROC and PRC curves shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures 2</ref>â6 show that the curves corresponding to our proposal are always above than the curves of SVMWD. This result indicates the better performance for all the possible thresholds of classification. It is interesting to study how the proposed method achieved its good performance. For both methods,<ref type="figure" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>shows the distribution of the FP according to the part of the gene to which the TIS sequences belong. The behavior is clear. Separating the negatives samples into four classes improves the discrimination between positive instances and negative instances from introns and intergenic regions. However, the number of FP for instances from exons increases but to a lesser extent than the decrease in the number of FP from introns and intergenic regions. Furthermore, the FP from exons may be reduced using other sources of information, such as content measures. The second part of our experiments was devoted to stop codon recognition. Stop codon recognition is a more difficult task because the achieved accuracy is less than that for TIS recognition. One of the major sources of this increased complexity is the number of negative instances. There are three different stop codons rather than just one as it is the case for TIS recognition; therefore, the number of negative instances is three times the number of negative instances for TIS prediction. For instance, using the same five chromosomes from the previous experiments, the best current method found411.5 million false-positive stop codons. This amount of incorrectly predicted stop codons might be able to mar any annotation system, indicating that there is ample room for improvement. Our approach for stop codon prediction used the same classifiers as for TIS recognition.<ref type="figure" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref>shows a summary of results for stop codon recognition. The first remarkable result is the large improvement in the number of both FN and FP. The FN were reduced by 26.8% in the worst case and by 57.9% in the best case. This result indicates that the number of total FN was reduced from 823 with SVMWD to 443 with our method. As for TIS recognition, an annotation program may not be able to recognize a gene when the stop codon is missing. Furthermore, this improvement was achieved along with a significant improvement in the FP. The FP improvement was also large with a best result of 46.9%. As a whole, 2.7 million FP from SVMWD were accurately classified as negatives by our method. This quantity of FP may overwhelm any annotation system; thus, the improvement should have a significant impact on automatic annotation.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 7</ref>shows the absolute improvement of our method in the specificity, sensitivity, G-mean, auROC and auPRC. The improvement for auROC is particularly relevant. The proposed approach improved the auROC by 3.7% in the worst case and 7.2% in the best case.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figures 8</ref>â12 show the ROC/PRC curves for the five chromosomes. As for TIS recognition, the ROC/PRC curves of our approach not only achieved a better auROC and auPRC but were also always above the curves of SVMWD.In Section 2, we stated that our approach could be applied to any type of classifier. In the previous experiments, we used SVMs because they achieved the best performance in the literature. Now, we present the results of another experiment that was conducted to demonstrate the applicability of our method to other classifiers. We used a decision tree using the C4.5 learning algorithm (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Quinlan, 1996</ref>) instead of SVMs. We tested a decision tree using the standard approach of only one training set and one classifier and using our method with the four classifiers that were used for SVMs. To avoid repeating all the experiments, we only performed experiments for chromosome 13. The results for both TIS and stop codon recognition are shown in<ref type="figure">Table 6</ref>. For TISThe table shows the specificity (Sp), sensitivity (Sn), TP, TN, FN, FP and area under the ROC and PRC curves (auROC/PRC) for both methods and the five studied chromosomes.recognition, the improvement was remarkable; the G-mean improved by 8%, and the auROC increased from 0.8189 to 0.9372. For stop codon classification, the improvement was even better. The standard approach had an auROC of 0.6853, whereas our approach achieved an auROC of 0.9260. As it was the case for the previous experiments, auPRC was low for all experiments because of the huge number of negative instances.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this article, we presented a new approach for TIS and stop codon recognition. This approach uses more than one classifier, divides the negative class into four different groups and trains one classifier for each type of negative class. This approach was applied to the recognition of TIS and stop codons in five human chromosomes. The approach was compared with the best current method for TIS and stop codon prediction. The proposed approach also has the advantage of its simplicity, which makes it easily applicable to any program for TIS or stop codon recognition. The reported results show that the proposed method shows improved sensitivity, specificity, auROC and auPRC compared with SVMWD. The results show a remarkable improvement in the ratio of FN and FP achieved over those of SVMWD. Because state-of-the-art annotation systems rely heavily on the accurate prediction of the functional sites of the gene, the proposed method is an effective way of improving current gene recognizers.The table shows the values of the specificity (Sp), sensitivity (Sn), geometric mean of the specificity and sensitivity and the area under the ROC/PRC curves (auROC/ auPRC).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><figDesc>â100, 0], [â75, 25], [â50, 0], [â50, 50], [â25, 0], [â25, 25], [â25, 75], [â10, 15], [â10, 40], [â10, 90], [0, 25], [0, 50] and</figDesc></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> METHODS AND DATA To evaluate our approach, we chose five different human chromosomes, namely chromosomes 1, 3, 13, 19 and 21 for testing purposes, and chromosome 16 for model selection. For each chromosome, we trained the classifiers with all the remaining chromosomes except 16, then we chose the best combination method using chromosome 16 and tested the chosen model with all the true TIS or stop codons and the negative samples of the given chromosome. That is, for chromosome 1, we trained the models with chromosomes 2 to 22 and X and Y except 16. Then, we chose the best combination method using chromosome 16 and tested this model using chromosome 1. A summary of these datasets is shown in Table 1. The chromosomes were selected with the aim of choosing chromosomes of different lengths and codification density. Chromosome 16 was chosen as validation set, as it is a chromosome of average length and coding density. For SVMWD, as no model selection is needed, chromosome 16 was added to the training set. We used all TISs and stop codons of the Consensus CDS (CCDS) update released for human of September 7, 2011. This update uses Human National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) build 37.3 and includes 26 473 CCDS IDs that correspond to 18 471 GeneIDs. One of the key aspects of the evaluation of any new proposal is the set of previous methods used in the comparison. Many different methods have been proposed for recognizing TISs and stop codons (Saeys et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2003; Zeng et al., 2002, Zien et al., 2000). However, these previous works and our own research (Garc Ä±a-Pedrajas et al., 2012) have shown that an SVM with a string kernel is the best state-of-the-art method not only for TISs and stop codons but also for splice sites (Sonnenburg et al., 2007). To assure the general advantage of SVMs with string kernels, we performed a preliminary study of the different available methods that included position weight matrices, decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, stop codon method (Saeys et al., 2007), Wang et al.&apos;s method (Wang et al., 2003), Salzberg&apos;s method (Salzberg, 1997) and SVMs with linear and Gaussian kernels and three different string kernels: the locality improved kernel, the weighted degree kernel (WD) and the weighted degree kernel with shifts (Râ¬ atsch et al., 2005) (WDS). SVMs with WD kernel obtained consistently the best results and thus was chosen as the method to be compared with our proposal. WDS obtained marginally better results than WD but with a far higher</note>

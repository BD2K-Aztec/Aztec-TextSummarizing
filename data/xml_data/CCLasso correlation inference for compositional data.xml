				<p>Motivation: Direct analysis of microbial communities in the environment and human body has become more convenient and reliable owing to the advancements of high-throughput sequencing techniques for 16S rRNA gene profiling. Inferring the correlation relationship among members of microbial communities is of fundamental importance for genomic survey study. Traditional Pearson correlation analysis treating the observed data as absolute abundances of the microbes may lead to spurious results because the data only represent relative abundances. Special care and appropriate methods are required prior to correlation analysis for these compositional data. Results: In this article, we first discuss the correlation definition of latent variables for compos-itional data. We then propose a novel method called CCLasso based on least squares with &apos; 1 penalty to infer the correlation network for latent variables of compositional data from metagenomic data. An effective alternating direction algorithm from augmented Lagrangian method is used to solve the optimization problem. The simulation results show that CCLasso outperforms existing methods, e.g. SparCC, in edge recovery for compositional data. It also compares well with SparCC in estimating correlation network of microbe species from the Human Microbiome Project. Availability and implementation: CCLasso is open source and freely available from https://github. com/huayingfang/CCLasso under GNU LGPL v3.</p>

Bacteria and archaea have been found in extreme conditions such as deep sea vents with high temperatures and rocks of boreholes beneath the Earth's surface (<ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Pikuta et al., 2007</ref>). The microorganisms affect environments where they exist, and vice versa. It is estimated that there are about 10 times microbe cells inhabiting our human body than human cells (<ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Savage, 1977</ref>). Microbes affect the human life on our food, health and medicine (<ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Gill et al., 2006</ref>). The way in which microbes affect the human health remains largely unknown. Analysis of the human microbiome may help us better understand our own genome. The increasing quality and reducing cost of sequencing technologies provide great opportunity to analyze the microbe communities through sequencing.

First, only a small proportion of microbes can be cultured under laboratory conditions. Second, only single microbe can be studied in laboratories but it is well known that most microbes need other microbes to survive. In contrast, sequencing technologies allow researchers to collect information from the whole genomes of all microbes in a community directly from their natural environment, facilitating mixed genomic surveys (<ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Handelsman et al., 1998</ref>). When data are available across many communities, the dependencies among microbes, which can be measured by correlations, may provide important clues on the interactions among microbes. However, one unique feature of sequencing-based survey data is that they only provide relative abundances of different microbes in a community because the sequencing results are a function of sequencing depth and the biological sample size (<ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Ni et al., 2013</ref>). Therefore, metagenomic data collected from mixed genomic survey studies belong to the so-called class of compositional data in statistics. It was pointed out by Pearson (1897) more than one century ago that correlation analysis method designed for absolute values could lead to spurious correlations for compositional data. Great attention and specialized methods are needed to appropriately analyze and interpret compositional data.<ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Filzmoser and Hron (2009)</ref>proposed a procedure based on balances to measure correlations for compositional data, but the groups defined by the balances cannot always be clearly defined and separated from each other.<ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Faust et al. (2012)</ref>proposed CCREPE based on permutation and bootstrap to infer the correlated significance but it's difficult to explain the difference between the permutation and bootstrap samples.<ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Friedman and Alm (2012)</ref>introduced correlation concepts of latent variables based on log-ratio transformation of compositional data and proposed an approximation method called SparCC to infer the correlation matrix under sparse assumption. But SparCC does not consider the influence of errors in compositional data which may reduce the estimation accuracy. In addition, there is no guarantee that the inferred covariance matrix from SparCC is positive definite and even the correlation coefficients may fall outside ½À1; 1. In this article, we propose a novel method based on least squares with ' 1 penalty after log ratio transformation for raw compositional data to infer the correlations among microbes through a latent variable model, called Correlation inference for Compositional data through Lasso (CCLasso). Similar to SparCC, CCLasso explicitly considers the compositional nature of the metagenomic data in correlation analysis, and it has the additional benefit that the estimated correlation matrix of the latent variables for compositional data is positive definite. We also propose an efficient alternating direction algorithm of augmented Lagrangian method to solve the optimization problem involved in our method. The tuning parameter that balances the loss function and sparse assumption is chosen through cross validation. The performance of CCLasso is compared with SparCC through simulation studies, using several correlation network structures and sample sizes. The simulation results show that CCLasso gives more accurate estimation for correlation matrix than SparCC as well as better edge recovery. When CCLasso and SparCC are applied to estimate the correlation networks of microbes from Human Microbiome Project (HMP), we find that CCLasso is comparable with SparCC in view of consistent accuracy and reproducibility. But for shuffled HMP datasets there are supposed to be no correlations for any species, SparCC always results some small correlations while CCLasso shrinks these small values into 0. We believe that CCLasso can be applied to study correlations of compositional data arising from metagenomic data in natural environment and human body, and it is also broadly applicable in many other contexts where there is interest to assess correlations of variables from compositional data.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Correlation of latent variables for compositional data</head><p>Suppose there are p microbe species and their absolute abundances are random vector y ¼ ðy 1 ;. .. ; y p Þ which cannot be directly observed in practice. Instead, only the compositional random vector x ¼ ðx 1 ;. .. ; x p Þ,</p><formula>x i ¼ y i X p k¼1 y k ; (1)</formula><p>can be observed from biological experiments. The absolute abundances y are called latent variables since they cannot be directly observed. The additive log normal distribution (<ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Aitchison and Shen, 1980</ref>) is a special case for Equation (1) when y is from a multivariate logarithm normal distribution. The relations among y are of more relevance than x's in both practice and theory. The interactions among microbe species are described by y while there is a negative correlation trend for compositional vector x from the constant sum constraint even in the absence of any correlations among y,Covariances between the latent absolute abundance y, which cannot be observed, and those of its compositional representation x, which are observed, can be related through the base equation (1),</p><formula>X p k¼1 x k ¼ 1 ) X</formula><p>Covðln x i ; ln x j Þ ¼ Covðln y i ; ln y j Þ À Covðln y i ; ln wÞ</p><p>ÀCovðln w; ln y j Þ þ Varðln wÞ; since ln x i ¼ ln y i À ln w. Let R ln x ¼ Varðln xÞ, R ln y ¼ Varðln yÞ and a ¼ Covðln y; ln wÞ À Varðln wÞ1 p =2 where 1 p is a p Â 1 vector of 1 0 s, then the matrix form of connection between R ln x and R ln y can be described as R ln x ¼ R ln y À a1 T À 1a T :</p><formula>(2)</formula><p>We can focus on the correlation among log transforms of y and we also call ln y latent variables. When x is from additive logistic normal, the independences among ln y are equivalent to y. Since there is information loss from y to x through normalization procedure (Equation 1), the problem of estimating R ln y from the sample estimation of R ln x is undefined without any assumptions. This can be easily seen from Equation (2) that there are pðp þ 1Þ=2 equations but pðp þ 1Þ=2 þ p unknown parameters. One way to get around this problem is to assume that R ln y is sparse which means that the interaction network among microbe species has a small proportion of all possible edges present compared to the fully connected network. Sparse structure is a very common assumption for under-determinated problems such as linear regression models (<ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Tibshirani, 1996</ref>), Gaussian graphical models (<ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Yuan and Lin, 2007</ref>) and compressed sensing (<ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Candes and Tao, 2005</ref>) where the number of unknown parameters is larger, sometimes much larger, than the number of data points. For compositional data, there may exist several sparse networks corresponding to the same R ln x because CCLassoy and its scaled form CðyÞy (C(y) is any arbitrary positive random variable which is a scaling factor) cannot be distinguished from the base equation (1) if both R ln y and R ln ðCðyÞyÞ are sparse. The sparse level of R ln y is the key because there is at most one sparse network R ln y whose edge density is no greater than 1 2 À 1 pÀ1 corresponding to the same R ln x. And this sparse density condition cannot be relaxed (See Supplementary Material). There are very few statistical methods available to investigate the correlation among the latent variables ln y with the exception of some recently introduced methods, e.g. SparCC (<ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Friedman and Alm, 2012</ref>). To remove a in the right hand of Equation (2), we can choose a matrix F with RankðFÞ ¼ p À 1 and F1 p ¼ 0 and multiple F on both sides in Equation (2), FR ln x F T ¼ FR ln y F T À Fa1 T p F T À F1a T p F T ¼ FR ln y F T :</p><formula>(3)</formula><p>The left hand of Equation (3) is the variance of Fln x and the right corresponding Fln y. And their relationship can be seen as Fln x ¼ Fðln y À 1 p ln wÞ ¼ Fln y:</p><p>The above relation can explain the two constraints for F. RankðFÞ ¼ p À 1 ensures that there is a 1 À 1 correspondence between x and Fln x since there is the constant sum constraint for x. So there is no loss of information in statistical inference from Fln x instead of x. F1 p ¼ 0 helps to cancel the common denominator w after log transformation. There are many such transformation matrices satisfying the two constraints, e.g. F ¼ ðE pÀ1 ; À1 pÀ1 Þ is the linear transformation for additive log ratio where the reference variables is x p and F ¼ E p À 1 p 1 T p =p for the centered log ratio for compositional data where E p is a p Â p identity matrix (<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Aitchison, 1982</ref>). Let R ¼ R ln y ¼ ½r ij  pÂp. The sample version S of R ln x can be obtained after the fraction estimation from raw data such as metagenomic data through the Bayesian pseudo count method (<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Agresti and Hitchcock, 2005</ref>). From Equation (3) and the sample estimation S for R ln x , we can get the following estimation equation, FRF T ¼ FSF T :</p><formula>(4)</formula><p>Since RankðFÞ ¼ p À 1 and R is a p Â p positive definite matrix, R cannot be directly estimated through Equation (3). The additional sparse assumption for R is reasonable in many application contexts, such as metagenomic data, since most of variable pairs are not expected to be correlated when the number of components is large. Therefore, we can impose some sparsity constraints to help model and infer R without other prior information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">SparCC and its limitations</head><p>Friedman and Alm (2012) proposed an iterative approximation approach called SparCC to solve the estimation equation (4) for a number of special forms of transformation matrix F. In short, SparCC first obtains a rough estimation for variance of latent variable ln y i and the corresponding correlation matrix. Then it uses a threshold to remove the most correlated pair and repeatedly estimates the variances and correlations until some terminating conditions are met. Under the above notation, SparCC's algorithm can be summarized as follows. First, SparCC obtains an estimation for the diagonal of R from a rough approximation that X j6 ¼i r ij ¼ 0; 8i:</p><formula>(5)</formula><p>The rough approximation (Equation 5) supplies additional p equations for Equation (4). This assumption means that every component has no correlations with others on average. Let F</p><formula>ðÀ1 pÀ1 ; E pÀ1 ÞRðÀ1 pÀ1 ; E pÀ1 Þ T ¼ F 1 SF T 1 ) 1 pÀ1 r 11 1 T pÀ1 À 1 pÀ1 R 21 À R 12 1 T pÀ1 þ R 22 ¼ F 1 SF T 1 :</formula><p>Computing the trace for both sides of above equation, we have</p><formula>ðp À 1Þr 11 þ X p i¼2 r ii À 2 X p i¼2 r 1i ¼ trðF 1 SF T 1 Þ:</formula><formula>If X p i¼2 r 1i ¼ 0, then ðp À 1Þr 11 þ X p i¼2 r ii ¼ trðF 1 SF T 1 Þ: Let F i ; i ¼ 2;</formula><p>.. . ; p be the additive log ratio transformation matrix where the x i is the reference variable, for example, F p ¼ ðE; À1 pÀ1 Þ. Then similar to F 1 , we have ðp À 1Þr ii þ X j6 ¼i r jj ¼ trðF i SF T i Þ for i ¼ 2;. .. ; p from the assumption (Equation 5). The corresponding solution is</p><formula>r ii ¼ 1 p À 2 ðtrðF i SF T i Þ À 1 2ðp À 1Þ X p i¼1 trðF i SF T i ÞÞ; (6) since E p þ 1 c 1 p 1 T p À1 ¼ E p À 1 cþp 1 p 1 T p .</formula><p>Then the basic coefficients can be obtained after substituting Equation (6) into Equation (4). In fact, the above procedure is just a way to solve Equation (4) and Equation (5). This is called basic SparCC in Friedman and Alm (2012). A potential problem for SparCC is that r ii in Equation (6) can be negative, and so a minimal value V min is required to replace negative r ii. Second, SparCC employs an iterative refinement scheme through excluding the strongest correlated pair if the corresponding magnitude exceeds a given threshold a. The r ii is updated through removing the most significant correlation pair based on another assumption like Equation (5), X j6 2Ci r ij ¼ 0;</p><formula>(7)</formula><p>where C i denotes the set of indices of ln y j identified to be strongly correlated with ln y i. Finally, SparCC repeats the former two steps to update the variance r ii and the correlation matrix of ln y through the threshold a for a given iteration time or until no new strongly correlated pair is identified or only three components left. And SparCC selects a correlation threshold to give an interaction network. As far as we are aware, SparCC is the first method to infer the correlations among latent variables ln y for compositional data. Its second step is an effective method to remove the strong assumption (Equation 5) in the first approximation step and Equation (7) is approximately right after removing the strongest pairs. Although it represents a significant advance in analyzing compositional data, SparCC has some limitations in the approximations. First, SparCC directly solves Equation (4) with a series of approximate assumptions, and the accuracy of Equation (4) is influenced by the errors resulting from these approximations. Second, there is no consideration for the overall property of the estimated correlation matrix. SparCC cannot guarantee the inferred correlation matrix to be positive definite and even the estimated correlations may fall out of ½À1; 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">CCLasso</head><p>We first note that the vectorization version of Equation (3) together with sample variance S is e ¼ ðF FÞvecðR À SÞ, where e satisfies EðeÞ ¼ 0 and VarðeÞ ¼ ðF FÞVarðvecðSÞÞðF T F T Þ. Let V S ¼ VarðvecðSÞÞ, then an inverse variance weighted loss function can be given as follows,</p><p>LOSS 1 ðRÞ ¼ 1 2 ðvecðR À SÞÞ T ðF T F T ÞððF FÞV S ðF T F T ÞÞ À1 ðF FÞðvecðR À SÞÞ;</p><formula>(8)</formula><p>where the inverse symbol M À1 is the Moore-Penrose pseudo inverse of M (<ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Penrose and Todd, 1955</ref>). The solution to minimize LOSS 1 ðRÞ in Equation (8) satisfies the estimation equation (4). One important property of the loss function (Equation 8) is that it is invariant for any choice of the linear transformation matrix F. This property results from the fact that the information for R in the original data is kept after log ratio transformation. The loss function LOSS 1 ðRÞ in Equation (8) is too complex to be handle for the high-dimensional covariance matrix V S (p 2 Â p 2 ). Inspired by Zhang and Zou (2012) for variance approximation of sample variance, we can use the following loss function to substitute Equation (8), LOSS 1 0 ðRÞ ¼ 1 2 trððFðR À SÞF T ÞðFSF T Þ À1 ðFðR À SÞF T ÞÞ:</p><formula>(9)</formula><p>The transformation matrix F in Equation (9) should be chosen reasonably. Considering the symmetry of components, let</p><formula>F 0 ¼ E p À 1 p 1 p 1 T</formula><p>p be the transformation matrix of centered log ratio with symmetric projection property F 2 0 ¼ F 0 ; F T 0 ¼ F 0. It is suggested that treating the weighting covariance matrix in loss functions as diagonal performs well in some high-dimensional problems (<ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Chen et al., 2013</ref>). Let V ¼ ðdiagðF 0 SF T 0 ÞÞ À1. We may consider another substitute for loss function, LOSSðRÞ ¼ 1 2 trððF 0 ðR À SÞF T 0 ÞVðF 0 ðR À SÞF T 0 ÞÞ ¼ 1 2 jjF 0 ðR À SÞF 0 jj 2 V :</p><formula>(10)</formula><p>The diagonal matrix V can be seen as a standardization matrix for F 0 ðR À SÞF 0. The key idea of our method is that we use the loss function (Equation 10) because of its simplicity. A reasonable approach to incorporating the sparse assumption for R is to minimize loss function plus a suitable penalty. An ideal penalty function is the number of non-zero elements in R À which is the off diagonal of R. But it is computationally intractable where the optimization involving jjR À jj 0 is a combinatorial optimization problem with an exponential complexity. A commonly used approach is to replace ' 0-norm by ' 1-norm (<ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Tibshirani, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Yuan and Lin, 2007</ref>). We consider the following objective function combining loss function and ' 1 penalty,</p><formula>f ðRÞ ¼ LOSSðRÞ þ PENðRÞ ¼ 1 2 jjF 0 ðR À SÞF 0 jj 2 V þ k n jjR À jj 1 ; (11)</formula><p>where PENðRÞ ¼ k n jjR À jj 1. The tuning parameter k n !0 in Equation (11) is used to balance the fit of model (3) and the sparsity assumption of R. CCLasso aims to find a positive definite matrix ^ R so that</p><formula>^ R ¼ arg min R10 f ðRÞ ¼ arg min R10 1 2 jjF 0 ðR À SÞF 0 jj 2 V þ k n jjR À jj 1 ; (12)</formula><p>where R 1 0 means R should be positive definite. The corresponding correlation matrix estimation can be derived from standardizing the diagonal elements of ^ R. The optimization problem involved in Equation (12) is convex since both the objective function f ðRÞ and the constraint region fRjR 1 0g are convex. So the local minimization of Equation (12) is global. Compared with SparCC, CCLasso explicitly considers the error terms behind the estimation equation (4) through the loss function (Equation 10). The sparse assumption is directly handled through an additional ' 1-type penalty function in contrast to the additional assumption (Equation 7) for SparCC. The estimated correlation matrix from Equation (12) is positive definite and its elements are located in ½À1; 1 from the positive definite restriction.</p></div>

AR(4) Model: Connect pair (i, j) if ji À jj 4, and set the correlation strength as 0.4, 0.2, 0.2 or 0.1 as the distance is 1, 2, 3 or 4, respectively. 4. Hub Model: Randomly select 3 points as hubs and the other p – 3 points as common points. Then connect each hub to others with a probability 0.7 while creating edges with probability 0.2 among the common points and all edge strength is set to be 0.2. 5. Block Model: Divide p points into 5 blocks equally. Connect each pair in the same block with probability 0.6 and correlation strength 0.4 while connecting points in different blocks with probability 0.2 and correlation strength 0.2.</p><p>To make the covariance matrix positive definite, the diagonal elements of R are set large enough and then normalized all as 1. The random model is a very common graph model in which every possible edge occurs independently with the same probability. Through setting the strength as 60.15 with equal probability, the random model roughly satisfies assumptions Equations (5) and (7) of SparCC. The neighbor model is a 2-dimensional geography model in which edges exist among nearest neighbors. The ARð4Þ model can be considered as a model where points are ordered linearly along a line where edges exist between those nodes whose distance is no more than 4, and the correlation decreases as the distance increases. The hub model describes a graph where some special nodes, called hubs, are connected to others with a higher probability than the connection probabilities among other nodes. The block model defines network clustering where edge probabilities are higher within groups than between groups. All models are sparse with different degrees of sparsity. The expect number of edges in the neighbor and ARð4Þ model is proportional to p while p 2 for the random, hub and block model. For all the models, we set p ¼ 50 and consider different sample sizes n ¼ 200, 300 and 500. For each model, and three combinations of (p, n), we repeat simulations 100 times. The tuning parameter k n is determined through 3-folds cross validation, and all data are used to estimate R and the correlation matrix. We reimplemented SparCC using R and the default tuning parameters a ¼ 0:1, k max ¼ 10 and V min ¼ 10 À4 are used while the final correlation is truncated by –1 and 1 as the lower and upper limit. SparCC is robust for its tuning parameters since only the strongest pair is removed in each iteration (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. S1</ref>). To compare the performance between CCLasso and SparCC for each combination of model setting and sample size, we define the correlation inference accuracy by the mean absolute error d 1 ð^ q; qÞ</p><formula>¼ 2 pðpÀ1Þ X i&lt;j j^ q ij À</formula><p>q ij j and the Frobenius norm distance d F ð^ q; qÞ ¼ jj^ q À qjj F between the estimated correlation matrix ^ q and the true one q. The area under the receiver operation characteristics curve (AUC) is used to assess the performance of CCLasso and SparCC on recovering the non-zero entries in the sparse covariance matrix R to avoid the threshold parameter selection.the corresponding results suggest that CCLasso performs better than SparCC in simulations. This may be due to the fact that CCLasso considers random errors while SparCC does not. For edge recovery, CCLasso also performs better than SparCC except for the random graph model when sample size is 200 and 300. This can be explained by the fact that the random model roughly satisfies assumptions Equations (5) and (7) of SparCC. The accuracy and AUC are not vey consistent such as d 1 and d F for CCLasso is smaller than SparCC but the AUC for SparCC is larger than CCLasso in the random model. This phenomenon's reason is that the accuracy measures the continuous distance between the estimation and the true one while AUC shows the discrimination between the non-zeros and zeros. More detailed results for ROC are shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref>. As the sample size increases, the gap between CCLasso and SparCC increases. For the low false-positive rate such as 0.1, the true-positive rate for CCLasso is larger than SparCC except the random graph model. An interesting phenomenon is that both CCLasso and SparCC perform poorly for the hub model, but as sample size increases the estimation efficiency improves. One should use a much larger sample size for some special graphical structures such as the hub model and the block model than others for given precision. We also compare CCREPE with CCLasso through ROC and find the performance of CCREPE is similar to SparCC (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. S2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">HMP data</head><p>Because of close relationships between ourselves and the microbes in our body, the Human Microbiome Project Consortium (2012a,b) aims to investigate the fundamental roles of the microbes in human health and disease. The high-quality sequencing reads in 16S variable regions 3–5 (V35) of HMP healthy individuals are used to explore the correlation interactions among the microbes in 18 body sites and the corresponding operational taxonomic units (OTUs) are obtained from the HMPOC dataset, available at http://www. hmpdacc.org/HMMCP/. We consider Phase I production study (<ref type="bibr">May1, 2010</ref>) and the first sample collected for multiple samples from the sample body site of the same individual. The data are further filtered by removing samples with less than 500 reads or more than 60% 0s are collected and by removing OTUs that are represented by less than 2 reads per sample on average or more than 60% 0s. The transformation from counts to compositional data cannot be directly normalized since both CCLasso and SparCC assume that the 0s in the OTU counts are not real 0 fractions. CCLasso adds all counts by the maximum rounding error 0.5 and then normalizes the counts to get compositional data.<ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Friedman and Alm (2012)</ref>provided Bayesian framework to estimate the fractions from counts for SparCC. The final estimation for SparCC is the median of estimations in 20 replicated samples from the posterior distribution of fractions. Since there is no prior information for true correlation network of taxon–taxon interaction in real data, we use consistent accuracy and reproducibility to compare the performance of CCLasso and SparCC. First, all data are used to construct a gold standard reference correlation matrix for CCLasso and SparCC. The estimated correlation matrix in this step is treated as " known " since all data are used. Second, we randomly select half samples to estimate the correlation matrix through CCLasso and SparCC. The consistent accuracy is measured by the Frobenius norm distance between the estimated correlation matrices of the first and second step. The consistent reproducibility is measured by the fraction of the same edges shared for these two steps in the first gold reference network which only the top 1/4 edges is used. This procedure is repeated 20 times for stable results. The results are summarized in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. CCLasso and SparCC have similar performance in terms of consistent accuracy and reproducibility. When the sample size is small, the reproducibility is low. Even for large sample size such as left Antecubital fossa, the reproducibility is only 0.64 for both CCLasso and SparCC. We can find consistent accuracy and reproducibility are not good criteria from the simulation data (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table S1</ref>). Since there are several optimization procedures for the cross validation of CCLasso, SparCC is faster than CCLasso (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table S2</ref>). The reproducibility is robust for the top edges' choice (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#tab_3">Table S3</ref>). We also compare the inferred correlation network from CCLasso and SparCC using all samples for all body sites and find their results are very similar (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S3 and Table S4</ref>).We also compare the performances between CCLasso and SparCC through shuffled HMP data. The individual counts are permuted for each OTUs, so it is supposed not to find any correlations among species.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2</ref>shows the histograms of estimated correlations through CCLasso and SparCC for the shuffled datasets. Almost none correlations are detected by CCLasso but there are always some small correlations inferred from SparCC. In this way, CCLasso outperform SparCC. We use CCLasso and SparCC for the other dataset and find SparCC detects too many strong meaningless edges (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S4</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p>Although compositional data arise naturally in many practical problems, researchers are generally more interested in the latent variables that underlie these data. For example, in genomic survey studies, it is of great interest to infer the dependency among different bacteria from the observed relative abundance, instead of the absolute abundance, of the bacteria. Therefore, there is a need to infer the correlation matrix among the latent variables for the compositional data. In this article, we have proposed a novel method to infer the correlations among the latent variables for compositional data. We use the sparse assumption to help estimate the correlation matrix of latent variables through solving the constant sum constraint problem. The simulation results show that CCLasso has better performance than SparCC, the only available method in the literature that we are aware of that attempts to solve this problem from a latent variable viewpoint. For the HMP data, CCLasso has similar consistent accuracy and reproducibilities as SparCC. But from the shuffled HMP datasets, we find that SparCC always gives some nonzero estimations. Though CCLasso performs better than SparCC in simulation studies, it has similar difficulties as SparCC such as reliable component fraction estimation and only linear relation explained. We adopt the simple pseudo count 0.5 to avoid 0 components for HMP datasets. There are other normalization methods that accounts for under sampling such as<ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Paulson et al. (2013)</ref>introduced a methodology to assess differential abundance in sparse high-throughput microbial marker-gene survey data. Recently,<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Biswas et al. (2014)</ref>proposed a Poisson-multivariate normal hierarchical model to learn direct interactions removing confounding predictors' effect from metagenomics sequencing experiments. The assumption of<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Biswas et al. (2014)</ref>is similar to CCLasso from the latent model view, but the essential difference between them is the compositional assumption. Future work will concentrate on improvement of the components estimation accounting for under sampling and exploring nonlinear relationships among microbes.</p></div>

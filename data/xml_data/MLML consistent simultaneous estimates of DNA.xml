			<abstract>
				<p>Motivation: The two major epigenetic modifications of cytosines, 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC), coexist with each other in a range of mammalian cell populations. Increasing evidence points to important roles of 5-hmC in demethyla-tion of 5-mC and epigenomic regulation in development. Recently developed experimental methods allow direct single-base profiling of either 5-hmC or 5-mC. Meaningful analyses seem to require combining these experiments with bisulfite sequencing, but doing so naively produces inconsistent estimates of 5-mC or 5-hmC levels. Results: We present a method to jointly model read counts from bisulfite sequencing, oxidative bisulfite sequencing and Tet-Assisted Bisulfite sequencing, providing simultaneous estimates of 5-hmC and 5-mC levels that are consistent across experiment types.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mark in mammals. In addition to the extensively studied 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) modification, its oxidation product, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC), has been observed at substantial levels in both somatic and embryonic stem cells (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Kriaucionis and Heintz, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Tahiliani et al., 2009</ref>). Recent studies of 5-hmC in mouse TET knock-out models (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Ito et al., 2010</ref>), mouse zygotic development (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Iqbal et al., 2011</ref>) and multiple cell types (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Globisch et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ito et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Kinney et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Sun et al., 2013</ref>) suggest that 5-hmC is involved in epigenetic regulation. The current most comprehensive and accurate method for profiling cytosine methylation is bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq). Treatment with sodium bisulfite converts unmethylated cytosines to uracils, but does not distinguish between 5-mC and 5-hmC (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Huang et al., 2010</ref>), and consequently the yield of methylation from BS-seq is the sum of 5-mC and 5-hmC levels. Two recently developed techniques, oxidative bisulfite sequencing (oxBS-seq) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Booth et al., 2012</ref>) and Tet-Assisted Bisulfite sequencing (TAB-seq) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Yu et al., 2012</ref>), provide high-throughput singlebase resolution measurements of 5-mC and 5-hmC, respectively. Any two of BS-seq, TAB-seq or oxBS-seq can be combined to profile both the 5-mC and 5-hmC methylomes of a cell population, and especially when studying 5-hmC, proper interpretation of results depends on having some estimate of the 5-mC level. However, naive manipulation of read count frequencies from independent sequencing experiments often produces two kinds of 'overshoot' problems in estimating 5-mC and 5-hmC levels. When combining BS-seq with TAB-seq, the 5-mC level at a given CpG site can be estimated by subtracting the 5-hmC level (TAB-seq) from the combined 5-mC þ 5-hmC level (BS-seq). The result can be negative, because of random sampling (or systematic error) in each experiment. Similarly, combining TAB-seq and oxBS-seq could lead to estimates of 5-mC and 5-hmC levels exceeding 100%. These overshoot sites may constitute a substantial proportion. In one dataset based on oxBS-seq technology, 17% of CpG sites captured by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and oxRRBS experiments exhibited overshoot (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Booth et al., 2012</ref>). To fully leverage the information in these data requires some method for making consistent estimates of 5-mC and 5-hmC levels. We present maximum likelihood methylation levels (MLML)</p><p>for simultaneous estimation of 5-mC and 5-hmC, combining data from any two of BS-seq, TAB-seq or oxBS-seq, or all three when available. Our estimates are consistent in that 5-mC and 5-hmC levels are non-negative, and never sum over 1. In an important subset of cases, our estimates are not only consistent but also show significantly greater accuracy at sites with lower coverage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">METHODS</head><p>Each of BS-seq, TAB-seq and oxBS-seq provides some amount of information about both the 5-mC and 5-hmC levels. Our approach is to combine information from any pair or all three of these experiments, and arrive at maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) for the 5-mC and 5-hmC levels. A similar method has been developed in the context of haplotype frequency estimation from pooled sequencing (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Kessner et al., 2013</ref>). To explain our method, we assume the data are from TAB-seq and BS-seq experiments for the same biological sample. The more general formulation is provided in Supplementary Information. Focusing on an individual CpG site, let p m denote the methylation level (a probability), p h the hydroxymethylation and p u ð¼ 1 À p m À p h Þ the level of unmethylated C. In the TAB-seq experiment, let h denote the number of C reads mapping over the CpG site, and let g denote the T reads mapping over the same CpG. The total reads covering the CpG site in the TAB-seq experiment is then h þ g. Similarly, let t denote the number of C reads mapping over the site in the BS-seq *To whom correspondence should be addressed.</p></div>

If values for p m and p h are known, h and u are binomial random variables, i.e. h $ Binðh þ g, p h Þ, and u $ Binðu þ t, p u Þ:</p><formula>fðhjp h Þ ¼ h þ g h p h h ð1 À p h Þ g , fðujp m , p h Þ ¼ u þ t u ð1 À p m À p h Þ u ðp m þ p h Þ t :</formula><p>Given observations of fh, g, u, tg, when no overshoot would result, we use the frequencies to estimate p ¼ ðp m , p h , p u Þ. In this case, the frequencies directly give MLEs. At overshoot sites, we introduce latent variables and use expectation maximization to approximate the MLE for p. Let t 0 (g 0 ) be the number of C (T) reads in BS-seq (TAB-seq) that correspond to 5-mCs. Then t À t 0 (g À g 0 ) is the number of C (T) reads corresponding to 5-hmC (unmethylated C). The complete data likelihood is then</p><formula>Lðp m , p h jt 0 , g 0 , t, u, h, gÞ ¼ fðt 0 , t À t 0 , u; t þ u, pÞ Â fðg 0 , h, g À g 0 ; h þ g, pÞ,</formula><p>where fðx, y, z; n, pÞ is a multinomial p.m.f. Estimates for p h and p m are then computed by expectation maximization algorithm to account for the latent t 0 and g 0 (Supplementary Information). The MLEs can be compared with binomial confidence intervals around corresponding frequency estimates if direct readouts (e.g. for 5-hmC in the case of TAB-seq) are available. When estimates fall outside the specified confidence interval, sites are flagged as being 'strongly' inconsistent. An overabundance of such sites might suggest systematic error.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RESULTS</head><p>To understand the properties of our estimators and the frequency method, we used simulations with fixed coverage and precisely set levels for 5-mC and 5-hmC, assuming the experiments were BS-seq and TAB-seq. The case of BS-seq and oxBSseq is symmetric with the estimates for p h and p m exchanged. For each valid combination of 5-mC and 5-hmC levels from f0:1, 0:3, 0:5, 0:7g, we simulated from binomial distributions for both BS-seq and TAB-seq. Estimates for p h and p m were made using the maximum likelihood method and the frequency method, which estimate p h using h=ðh þ gÞ and p m using maxð0, t=ðu þ tÞ À h=ðh þ gÞÞ. The relative error (j ^ p À pj=p) for both estimation methods was computed and then averaged over 100 000 simulations for each parameter combination. The average estimation errors are presented in Supplementary Table S1. Estimates of p h are more accurate using MLML, especially at lower values of p h and low coverage. For example, when the true values are p m ¼ 0:1, p h ¼ 0:1, the MLML reduces the average relative error by 423% at overshoot sites compared with frequency estimates when the coverage is 10Â, and this reduction in error increases to 57% for such sites covered only 5Â. The trend for errors of p h estimates is shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1a</ref>, indicating the accuracy advantage for MLML as a function of coverage. The simulation also revealed substantial amounts of overshoot sites under different 5-mC and 5-hmC level combinations (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1b</ref>, Supplementary Tables).</p><formula>MLML Frequency p h = 0.1, p m = 0.1 p h = 0.1, p m = 0.</formula><formula>(a) p h = 0.1, p m = 0.1 p h = 0.1, p m = 0.3 fold coverage</formula></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig.1.</head><figDesc>Fig. 1.

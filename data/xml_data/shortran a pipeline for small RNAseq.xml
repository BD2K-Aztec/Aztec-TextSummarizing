			<abstract>
				<p>High-throughput sequencing currently generates a wealth of small RNA (sRNA) data, making data mining a topical issue. Processing of these large data sets is inherently multidimensional as length, abundance, sequence composition, and genomic location all hold clues to sRNA function. Analysis can be challenging because the formulation and testing of complex hypotheses requires combined use of visualization, annotation and abundance profiling. To allow flexible generation and querying of these disparate types of information, we have developed the shortran pipeline for analysis of plant or animal short RNA sequencing data. It comprises nine modules and produces both graphical and MySQL format output. Availability: shortran is freely available and can be downloaded from</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>One of the challenges in bioinformatics is to create tools with sufficient flexibility to enable formulation and testing of complex biological hypotheses while remaining technically simple and user friendly. Useful programs for processing small ribonucleic acid (sRNA)-seq data exist, such as the UEA (University of East Anglia) sRNA toolkit (<ref type="bibr">Moxon et al., 2008</ref>), wapRNA (<ref type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2011</ref>) and Dario (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Fasold et al., 2011</ref>). However, during our analysis of large-scale sRNA-seq datasets, two issues hampered our progress when using the existing tools. One was restrictions on data upload sizes and parameter adjustment options for web-based tools and the other was a lack of options for easy integration and combined querying of sRNA expression and annotation data. To help address these issues, we developed the shortran pipeline for sRNA-seq analysis. It is a command-line Python-based software package consisting of nine modules that can be used independently. The pipeline output includes graphical summaries, text files that can be easily parsed and automatic construction of a MySQL database, which allows simultaneous querying of expression and annotation data. Its features are compared with those of the existing pipelines in Supplementary Table S1. shortran is aimed at a broad group of users with only basic bioinformatics training, requiring only little experience with command line and database environments for successful use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Analysis pipeline summary</head><p>For maximum flexibility, the pipeline consists of independent modules. They include pre-processing (Module 1), annotation (Modules 2–6), quantitative analysis (Modules 7–8) and database querying (Module 9) (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Data pre-processing</head><p>The data pre-processing implemented in Module 1 enables the user to quickly focus on the most relevant sequences. The first steps are adapter trimming of the raw sequencing files using FASTX (http://hannonlab. cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/), followed by an optional k-mer correction using ECHO (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Kao et al., 2011</ref>). Subsequently, read information is summarized in an expression profile table, which is then used as a basis for filtering by abundance and inter-library variation. Finally, Bowtie (<ref type="bibr">Langmead et al., 2009</ref>) is used for filtering based on similarity to sequences in a user-provided multi-fasta file. Module 1 also generates a number of graphical data summaries for checking library sizes and length distributions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Annotation</head><p>The mapping and annotation modules feed their results into the MySQL output database, where the annotation data is appended to the profile tables, allowing simultaneous querying of both expression data and annotations. The annotation process starts with mapping filtered reads to a reference genome using Bowtie (<ref type="bibr">Langmead et al., 2009</ref>) (Module 2). For convenient visualization, the genomic mapping positions are combined with expression profiles in .igv files (http://www.broadinstitute.org/ igv/). As a first step in sRNA categorization, loci characterized by multiple, closely spaced, sRNAs are defined as clusters (Module 3). To predict potential plant and animal miRNAs and plant ta-siRNAs, we have included support for mirDeep-P and mirDeep2 (<ref type="bibr">Friedla¨nderFriedla¨nder et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yang and Li, 2011</ref>) (Module 4), and a modified version of Chen's algorithm (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Chen et al., 2007</ref>) (Module 5). As a quality control for miRNA prediction, the results are mapped and compared with conserved miRNAs. Finally, by using Bowtie to map sRNAs against user-supplied sequence files and directly transferring the resulting annotations to the MySQL database, we provide a simple way of adding multiple sets of similarity-based annotations (Module 6). *To whom correspondence should be addressed. ß The Author 2012.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Comparative quantitative analysis and plotting</head><p>To provide an overview of sRNA expression, pairwise scatter plots are generated. Normalized sRNA counts can be compared directly or libraries can be normalized to a reference sample to compare fold changes. In addition, correlation coefficients are calculated (Module 7). The sequence of the first one to three nucleotides of each sRNA is analyzed to identify biases (Module 8).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Database querying</head><p>The MySQL database with combined expression and annotation information can be queried using standard SQL syntax, generating a text file output (Module 9).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">APPLICATION</head><p>We analyzed 18 sRNA-seq libraries representing the major Arabidopsis root cell types and developmental zones using shortran (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S2</ref>) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Breakfield et al., 2012</ref>). In the original study, the authors focused on miRNAs and briefly mentioned cell-type-specific enrichment of 19-mer sRNAs. Here, we exploit the ease of combining annotation and profiling information using shortran to describe the features of this class of sRNAs in detail. The total 200 million reads were processed with and without a variation score cutoff (stdev/ˇaverage420) (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. S1</ref>). There was a large variation in library size, with larger libraries showing higher correlation between replicates (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S2</ref>and<ref type="figure">Table S3</ref>). Since the ENDODERMIS2 library was small and showed very poor correlation with all other samples, we ignored it in the subsequent analyses. Application of the variation score cutoff elevated the correlation coefficients (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S3</ref>, Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S3</ref>) but did not affect the sequence composition of nucleotides 1–3 (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S4</ref>). In accordance with the original study, miRNA prediction by Module 4 identified a number of conserved and putative novel miRNAs that displayed high variation scores (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S5</ref>and Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S7</ref>Q1). The graphical data summaries produced by Module 1 showed that the stele and endodermis libraries were strongly enriched for 19-mers compared with the cortex, epidermis and columella samples (Supplementary Figs S4 and S5). To determine the precise nature of the enrichment, we queried the shortran MySQL output database (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S6</ref>), filtering out 19-mer sRNAs at least three times enriched in stele and endodermis (Supplementary Table S7, Q2). Both construction and querying of the database were computationally light (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S8</ref>). All the resulting 69 sRNAs were assigned to the same genomic clusters by Module 3, and Module 6 mapped them all to Glycine transfer ribonucleic acids (tRNAs) with TCC anticodons (Supplementary Table S9 and<ref type="figure">Fig. S6</ref>). Using further queries (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S7 Q3</ref>–Q10), we found that the Gly tRNA derived sRNAs fully explained the 19-mer enrichment in the stele and endodermis libraries, and we showed that the enrichment was not limited to the most abundant Gly TTC-associated sRNA (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#tab_0">Table S10</ref>, lines 1–10). This dominant role of Gly tRNAs in sRNA generation agrees with previous observations (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Hsieh et al., 2009</ref>). Interestingly, the remaining 19-mer tRNA-derived sRNAs were most abundant in columella cells (Supplementary Table S10, lines 11–12). This enrichment was caused exclusively by sRNAs derived from Arg CCT tRNAs (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table  S7</ref>Q11–12,<ref type="figure" target="#tab_0">Table S10</ref>lines 13–16 and<ref type="figure">Fig. S6</ref>), emphasizing the differential cellular expression and potential biological significance tRNA-associated sRNAs.</p></div>

			<note place="foot" n="4"> CONCLUSION Shortran provides an efficient and user-friendly tool for flexible analysis of sRNA-seq data. Using shortran, we were able to quickly generate and combine annotation and profiling information from a complex sRNA-seq experiment. We could then easily mine the data using MySQL queries to identify specific sRNAs for experimental follow-up.</note>

				<p>Motivation: Bisulfite sequencing is currently the gold standard to obtain genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in eukaryotes. In contrast to the rapid development of appropriate pre-processing and alignment software, methods for analyzing the resulting methylation profiles are relatively limited so far. For instance, an appropriate pipeline to detect DNA methylation differences between cancer and control samples is still required. Results: We propose an algorithm that detects significantly differentially methylated regions in data obtained by targeted bisulfite sequen-cing approaches, such as reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. In a first step, this approach tests all target regions for methylation differences by taking spatial dependence into account. A false discovery rate procedure controls the expected proportion of incorrectly rejected regions. In a second step, the significant target regions are trimmed to the actually differentially methylated regions. This hierarchical procedure detects differentially methylated regions with increased power compared with existing methods. Availability: R/Bioconductor package BiSeq.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification regulating gene transcription and is known to direct development and differentiation (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gopalakrishnan et al., 2008</ref>). A CG dinucleotide (CpG site) is called methylated if a methyl group is attached to the cytosine (C). DNA treatment with sodium bisulfite specifically introduces conversion of unmethylated cytosine to uracil (then read as thymine by DNA polymerase), whereas methylcytosine remains unmodified (<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Krueger et al., 2012</ref>). These changes are mapped by next-generation sequencing. To save per-sample costs, bisulfite sequencing (BS) can be combined with enrichment strategies to target bisulfite sequencing to a specific fraction of the genome (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bock, 2012</ref>). Along with DNA fragment capture, it is possible to use restriction enzymes as for reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS), which measures genome-wide DNA methylation in CpG-rich regions (<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Meissner et al., 2005</ref>). Msp1 (cleaves at CCGG) digested fragments are size-selected to obtain fragments with short distance between Msp1 sites. Bisulfite-treated DNA fragments are then sequenced and mapped via conversion-aware aligners, such as Bismark (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Krueger and Andrews, 2011</ref>), RRBSMAP (<ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Xi et al., 2012</ref>), BS Seeker (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chen et al., 2010</ref>) or PASS-bs (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Campagna et al., 2012</ref>). The aligners usually return a list of CpG sites with the number of cytosines and thymines among all reads aligned to the cytosine in the genomic DNA sequence, which is then used for subsequent analyses. Aberrant DNA methylation patterns are a characteristic feature of cancer (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Das and Singal, 2004</ref>). Often, studies focus on promoter regions or gene bodies or—more generally—genomic regions that are differentially methylated between cancer and normal specimens. In this context, a differentially methylated region (DMR) denotes a genomic region of adjacent CpG sites that are differentially methylated. Because of lower costs of RRBS or other targeted bisulfite sequencing approaches increasingly larger number of samples are measured, which enables a comparison of DNA methylation and the detection of DMRs between groups of samples (<ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Schoofs et al., 2013</ref>). In the past 3 years, several software tools for descriptive BS data analysis have been published. MethVisual (<ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Zackay and Steinhoff, 2010</ref>) is an R/Bioconductor (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gentleman et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">R Core Team, 2012</ref>) package for visualization and exploratory statistical analysis of BS data. BiQ Analyzer HT (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lutsik et al., 2011</ref>) allows a locus-specific analysis and visualization. SAAPRRBS (<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Sun et al., 2012</ref>) provides methylation summary statistics and annotation of CpG sites. Nevertheless, few tools to detect DMRs exist. The most common approach is to perform Fisher's exact test CpG-wise or region-wise (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Challen et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gu et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Li et al., 2010</ref>). Recently, BSmooth was published, a pipeline to detect differentially methylated regions in wholegenome BS data (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hansen et al., 2012</ref>). BSmooth basically relies on smoothing the methylation values sample-wise and then testing for group differences via CpG-wise t-tests. DMRs are defined as adjacent CpG sites with absolute t statistics above a defined threshold. To assess the goodness of the results, a suitable error measure is needed. For example, it would be convenient to control the false discovery rate (FDR) on genomic regions, i.e. the expected proportion of regions rejected erroneously out of all regions rejected, testing the null hypothesis that the regions are not differentially methylated. However, the desire for a convenient analysis of BS data and the establishing of an error measure pose challenges specific to the analysis of BS data: first, the coverage, i.e. the number of reads spanning a CpG site varies widely between different CpG sites and different samples. As a consequence, each sample has an individual profile of covered *To whom correspondence should be addressed.</p><p>CpG sites, and missing values occur frequently. Second, the specific probability distribution of methylation levels requires specific statistical models. Third, the methylation of neighbored CpG sites is spatially correlated and, hence, are the CpG-wise test statistics and P-values. The first and to our knowledge only approach accounting for spatial dependence in multiple hypothesis testing is methylKit, an R package for the analysis of RRBS data and its variants (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Akalin et al., 2012</ref>). methylKit models the methylation per CpG site within a logistic regression. A sliding linear model (SLIM) method is used to determine q values from P-values to correct for multiple hypothesis testing (<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Wang et al., 2011</ref>). We propose BiSeq, a DMR detecting approach that enables testing for DMRs within target regions and controlling a given FDR. This approach is tailored to data received by all kinds of targeted bisulfite sequencing approaches. The article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give a rough overview of the step-by-step approach. The individual steps are presented in detail in Section 3. In Section 4, we apply the approach to simulated data and compare its results with those from BSmooth and methylKit. Furthermore, we apply BiSeq to a published leukemia dataset. In Section 5, we briefly discuss our results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">APPROACH</head><p>The analysis is confined to the target region. For RRBS, these are genomic regions with a high spatial density of covered CpG sites. These regions are called CpG clusters. The approach has two aims: first, the detection of CpG clusters with at least one differentially methylated CpG site. Second, the trimming of the differentially methylated CpG clusters to the actually differentially methylated CpG sites. In detail, BiSeq is a five-step approach:</p><p>((5) Define DMR boundaries</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Data</head><p>We used RRBS data of bone marrow specimens of 18 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia at diagnosis that was recently published by<ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Schoofs et al. (2013)</ref>. Additionally, there are 16 control samples composed of four samples of healthy CD34 þ cells, four samples of promyelocytes (generated in vitro from the CD34 þ cells) and eight remission bone marrow samples of matched patient samples. After MspI digestion, size selection (40–220 bp) and bisulfite conversion, the RRBS libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiScanSQ instrument. Using Bismark version 0.5, sequencing reads were mapped to hg19 genome and methylation calls were extracted (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Krueger and Andrews, 2011</ref>). On average, 1.17 Â 10 7 reads were uniquely mapped per sample yielding coverage of almost 9.3 Â 10 6 CpG sites of which 9.4 Â 10 5 CpG sites were covered in all samples. To obtain a dataset with known DMRs, we took 12 control samples (four remission, four CD34 þ and four promyelocyte) from the data described earlier in the text. Half of the samples (two remission, two CD34 þ and two promyelocyte) were kept as control samples. Within the other half, we simulated DMRs by placing methylation differences of various intensities and lengths, so that these could be considered as cancer samples. CpG island positions were downloaded from UCSC database (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Goldman et al., 2012</ref>) within which 5000 DMRs were placed. Because of the fact that DMRs reported in literature usually fall within widths of a few hundred to a few thousand base pairs (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bock, 2012</ref>), we sampled the DMR lengths l from a truncated Gaussian: l $N ð100, 150 2 Þ, with 105l51000. Each DMR was placed into a CpG island that was at least as long as the respective DMR with probabilities proportional to the CpG island length. Overlapping of simulated DMRs was allowed. Differences d were sampled from a truncated Gamma: d $ Àð1:9, 0:08Þ, with 05d51, so that the resulting differences were positive. For a detailed description of how simulated DMRs were incorporated into the data, see the Supplementary Data. In Supplementary Figures S1 and S2, the distributions of the lengths and differences of the resulting 4 034 DMRs are shown. Within the 12 samples, almost 8 Â 10 6 CpG sites were covered of which 1.9 Â 10 6 CpG sites were covered in all samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">CpG clusters</head><p>The RRBS method provides methylation information of CpG-rich regions primarily. For this reason and because of the spatial correlation of the methylation of nearby CpG sites, we constrain the analysis on CpG sites within CpG clusters. These CpG clusters are regions detected as follows: first, we define frequently covered CpG sites as CpG sites that are covered in the majority of the samples. Second, we search for regions within which the frequently covered CpG sites are close to each other. Third, we retain only regions with a minimum number of frequently covered CpG sites. In both, the acute promyelocytic leukemia data as well as in the simulated data, CpG sites covered in at least 75% of samples were defined as frequently covered CpG sites. A maximum distance d max of 100 bp to their nearest neighbor within a CpG cluster was accepted. Only CpG clusters with at least 20 frequently covered CpG sites were used for the analysis. Note that the frequently covered CpG sites are considered to define the CpG cluster boundaries only. For subsequent analysis, all methylation data within these CpG clusters are used. The CpG cluster detection is applicable for other targeted BS data in the same manner. Alternatively, rather than CpG clusters, the target regions may be used, e.g. if a DNA capture method followed by BS was used.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Model and test group effect</head><p>Testing of group effects on methylation levels is usually done via t-tests, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests or linear regression (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bock, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hansen et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Wang et al., 2012</ref>). Nevertheless, as the methylation values y 2 ð0, 1Þ, the beta distribution is the appropriate distribution for modeling y (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Ferrari and Cribari-Neto, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kuan et al., 2010</ref>).

Thus, we model the mean of the methylation level y i at position i within a beta regression.</p><formula>gð i Þ ¼ X k j¼1 x ij j ,</formula><p>where ¼ ð 1 ,. .. , k Þ T is a vector of the regression parameters and x i1 ,. .. , x ik are observations on k covariates. The link function gð:Þ is strictly monotonic, twice differentiable and maps ð0, 1Þ into R. The most common link for methylation levels is the logit function gðÞ ¼ logð=ð1 À ÞÞ. Nevertheless, we prefer to use the probit function gðÞ ¼ È À1 ðÞ, where È À1 ð:Þ is the inverse of the standard cumulative normal distribution function, as this link is more moderate in the transformation of extreme values close to 0 or 1. The maximum likelihood estimators of and do not have a closed form and need to be obtained using numerical methods, for details see Ferrari and Cribari-Neto (2004). The methylation variation of cancer samples is often higher than for normal samples (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hansen et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Schoofs et al., 2013</ref>). An extension of the beta regression is the variable dispersion beta regression model. In this case, the biological variability and, hence, the precision parameter may be additionally modeled within a linear model with the group (e.g. cancer/normal) as independent variable (Cribari<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Neto and Zeileis, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Simas et al., 2010</ref>). We fit the beta regression model to the smoothed methylation levels at each CpG site and test for a group effect using the Wald test.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Hierarchical testing</head><p>As the number of tested CpG sites usually exceeds 1 million, the problem of multiple testing plays an important role in the detection of differentially methylated CpG sites.<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bock (2012)</ref>points out that after multiple testing correction, only the strongest differences tend to remain significant. We suggest applying a hierarchical testing procedure by<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Benjamini and Heller (2007)</ref>on target regions. They introduced a hierarchical testing procedure that first tests regions and then tests the locations within the rejected regions. As region units are tested first rather than locations, the number of hypothesis tests is reduced, which increases statistical power.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Test CpG clusters</head><p>The aim is to detect CpG clusters containing at least one differentially methylated location and to control a size-weighted FDR on clusters. The weighted FDR (WFDR), proposed by<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Benjamini and Hochberg (1997)</ref>, ensures that the chance of rejecting a cluster increases when it is larger, but on the other hand, that also the weight of the error increases if a large cluster is falsely rejected. To control the WFDR, the weighted Benjamini– Hochberg procedure (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1997</ref>) is applied on cluster P-values. For CpG site i in CpG cluster c, the P-value p ic arising from the Wald test is transformed to the normally distributed z-score: z ic ¼ È À1 ð1 À p ic Þ. As cluster test statistic, the standardized z-score average " Z c = ^ " Zc of the cluster locations i ¼ 1,. .. , m c is used, with " Z c the zscore average and ^ " Zc the estimated standard deviation of " Z c.

The weighted Benjamini–Hochberg procedure at level q is applied on the Pvalues ~ Èð " Z c = ^ " Zc Þ of all CpG clusters, with ~ È the right tail probability of the standard normal distribution. The cluster P-values are ordered so that p ð1Þ Á Á Á p ðcÞ Á Á Á p ðmÞ. The CpG clusters corresponding to the smallest k P-values are rejected, with k ¼ maxfc : p ðcÞ ð P c b¼1 w ðbÞ = mÞqg, with w ðbÞ being the weight associated with the size of cluster b and P m b¼1 w ðbÞ ¼ m, the number of clusters.<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1997</ref>showed that, for independent cluster test statistics, WFDR P b2I0 w b =m q, with I 0 the subset of indices corresponding to clusters without DMRs (true null clusters). If the joint distribution of the cluster test statistics is positive regression-dependent (PRDS) on the subset of true null clusters then WFDR clust q (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Benjamini and Yekutieli, 2001</ref>). In particular, the PRDS property is satisfied if the cluster test statistics are Gaussian, non-negatively correlated and the testing hypotheses are one-sided. To ensure that the variance of the z-scores is Gaussian with variance 1, we recommend to estimate the variogram under the null hypothesis, e.g. for re-sampled data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7">Trim significant CpG clusters</head><p>The aim is to remove the not differentially methylated CpG sites within the rejected CpG clusters and to control a location-wise FDR.

A multiple testing two-stage procedure at level q 2 , as suggested by<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Benjamini et al.

Thus, we define DMRs as regions of adjacent rejected CpG sites within one CpG cluster. DMRs are divided if the methylation difference switches from positive to negative, or vice versa. This way we ensure that within a DMR, all CpG sites are hypermethylated or hypomethylated, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Simulation data</head><p>We applied the algorithm to our simulated dataset described in Section 3.1, obtaining 28 471 CpG clusters within which we smoothed the methylation levels for 1 710 164 CpG sites.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1A</ref>shows the effect of smoothing for a selected sample and a selected genomic region. In<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1B</ref>, the smoothed methylation profiles for all samples are shown for the same region. DMRs were identified with different choices of q and q 2 .<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>shows the chosen q and q 2 together with the achieved cluster-wise WFDRs and location-wise FDRs. For q ¼ 0:05 and q ¼ 0:1, respectively, the WFDR could be controlled with WFDR5 P b2I0 w b =m q. In contrast, the location-wise FDRs could not be controlled. However, this result was expected as the DMRs were expanded spatially by the smoothing step, as seen in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1B</ref>. This explanation is supported by the fact that the location-wise FDRs could be controlled for pruned DMRs (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>, last column). Pruned DMRs were obtained as follows: after trimming and testing, the DMRs were defined as described in Section 3.8. Each DMR 480 bp, which is corresponding to the width of the smoothing window, was pruned by 40 bp (half the bandwidth) at each side. Smaller DMRs remained unchanged. Thus, we omitted CpG sites that were differentially methylated because of the smoothing. For the remaining CpG sites, we achieved control of the location-wise FDR. Results for other choices of parameters for CpG cluster definition (d max ) and for smoothing (h) are shown in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2. The probability to detect a differentially methylated CpG site (power) is depicted in<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>depending on its simulated difference and on the fraction of differentially methylated CpG sites in its CpG cluster. As a standardized averaged z-score is used as cluster test statistic, the fraction of high z-scores affects the probability to reject a cluster.<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>suggests that a CpG site with a methylation difference of at least 0.2 located in a CpG cluster with430% differentially methylated CpG sites was detected with a probability of 490%. This implies that not only the methylation difference but also the choice of the CpG clusters is crucial for the power. To illustrate the performance of our approach in comparison with others, we also applied BSmooth and methylKit to the simulated data. For BSmooth (version 0.4.3), we set the parameters for smoothing similar to the BiSeq parameter choices: the minimum number of methylation loci in a smoothing window (ns) was set to 20, the minimum bandwidth (h) was set to 80 and the maximum gap between two methylation loci, before the smoothing is broken across the gap (maxGap), was set to 100 bp. For CpG sites where at least two cancer samples and at least two normal samples had a minimum coverage of two reads (as recommended in the package vignette) were tested for differential methylation (3 187 862 CpG sites). Despite of comparable parameter choices, the number of tested CpG sites is higher than for BiSeq. This is because the given bandwidth is a minimum bandwidth and is enlarged until at least 20 CpG sites are included within the smoothing window. A consequence is that the degree of smoothing is different from sample to sample for the same genomic region and also within the genome of one sample. Furthermore, BSmooth adopts local A BNote: Shown are the choices of q with the resulting upper bound for independent cluster test statistics and q 2 together with the observed cluster-wise WFDR, location-wise FDR and the location-wise FDR in pruned DMRs. logistic regression for smoothing. One main drawback of the regression approach is extrapolation: if methylation is predicted outside of a covered genomic region, the last observed slope is continued, often resulting in extrapolated methylation values of 0 and 1, see Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure S3</ref>for an example. The variance was estimated for the control group, as suggested in the package vignette. CpG sites with associated absolute t-statistics beyond a certain cut-off were defined as differentially methylated CpG sites. methylKit (version 0.5.5) was applied to locations that are covered in at least four samples per group (2 903 270 CpG sites). It is necessary to set such a threshold because there is no smoothing step; hence, many CpG sites are covered in a fraction of the samples only. CpG sites with associated q values below a certain cut-off were defined as differentially methylated CpG sites.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>shows ROC curves for all three approaches. As two FDR levels have to be chosen for BiSeq, we plotted several lines each showing the results for fixed q and varying q 2. In summary, BiSeq achieved a higher sensitivity than BSmooth and methylKit for false positive rates 58%.</p></div>

We modeled the methylation levels applying a beta regression with group (cancer/control) and gender as explanatory variables. The precision parameter was modeled within an additional model with group as explanatory variable, as we expect higher methylation variances in the leukemia samples (<ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Schoofs et al., 2013</ref>). Testing the CpG clusters at a WFDR of 0.1 leads to the rejection of 7760 clusters. Cluster trimming at an FDR of 0.05 revealed 306 807 differentially methylated CpG sites, forming 9442 DMRs. The median of the DMR widths was 168 bp (minimum: 1 bp, maximum: 2401 bp). The vast majority (95.6%) of the differentially methylated CpG sites were hypermethylated in leukemia samples, see Supplementary<ref type="figure">Figure S4</ref>for the frequency distribution. Plotting the chromosomal positions of the differentially methylated and of all tested CpG sites revealed that for some chromosomes, the distribution of differentially methylated CpG sites was shifted toward chromosomal ends in relation to the distribution of the tested CpG sites (<ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Schoofs et al., 2013</ref>). Supplementary<ref type="figure">Figure S5</ref>depicts the distributions in chromosome 5. Moreover, it might be of interest whether certain genomic regions were located in DMRs more (or less) frequently than statistically expected. Briefly, we determined the centers of regions of interest, e.g. gene promoters, and then calculated the expected number of region centers within each DMR, assuming a uniform distribution of the centers in the CpG clusters. The number of expected region centers was then subtracted from the number of region centers actually observed in the DMRs. This analysis yielded that gene bodies were significantly overrepresented in hypermethylated DMRs, and promoters were underrepresented in both, hyper-and hypomethylated DMRs (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S6</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">DISCUSSION</head><p>We proposed a DMR detection approach that tests regions for differential methylation with subsequent localization of DMRs within rejected regions. This hierarchical procedure is more powerful than BSmooth and methylKit.<ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. Power to detect differentially methylated CpG sites. Shown is the influence of the CpG methylation difference and DMR fraction of the respective CpG clusters on the probability to detect a differentially methylated CpG site. The higher the simulated methylation difference the higher was the probability to reject the CpG site (y-axis). The higher the fraction of differentially methylated CpG sites in CpG clusters, the higher was the probability to reject the clusters and, hence, to reject the CpG sitesOne strength of the proposed algorithm is that a region-wise FDR can be controlled. Nevertheless, we could ask whether smoothing of methylation data and focusing on regions is an appropriate strategy considering the fact that methylation of a single CpG site can prevent transcription factor binding (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Gaston and Fried, 1995</ref>). To investigate whether focusing on region-wise methylation changes is meaningful, we analyzed the spatial clustering behavior of differentially methylated CpG sites in the leukemia dataset. We tested CpG sites for differential methylation in leukemia compared with controls without smoothing beforehand. This way we ensured that we did not add additional spatial correlation. We compared Ripley's K functions for both, tested CpG sites and differentially methylated CpG-sites and could show that the clustering of differentially methylated CpG sites is more pronounced than the clustering of tested CpG sites (which is due to the targeted sequencing). Differentially methylated CpG sites tend to form clusters of sizes up to 1000 bp (see Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S7</ref>). The fact that entire regions are particularly effected by differential methylation in leukemia (and probably in other cancer types as well) justifies smoothing and detection of differentially methylated regions. An advantage over other approaches is that the methylation levels are modeled within a regression model allowing adding further independent variables and confounders to the model. For instance, Boks et al., 2009 found associations of DNA methylation with gender and age; thus, it might be important to take these confounders into account. Neither BSmooth nor the methylKit package allows adding further variables. By modeling the methylation levels within a beta regression, we make sure that basic properties of methylation levels are respected, i.e. the distribution between 0 and 1 and a smaller variance near the boundaries. Another advantage of the beta regression is the option to consider higher variances in a group of samples (commonly the cancer samples) via a variable precision parameter. A drawback is the long computing time. Most of the parameters that have to be chosen are related to CpG cluster detection and thus influence the extent of the genome that is to be analyzed. Basically, the grade of the minimal spatial density of covered CpG sites that form CpG clusters together with the width of the smoothing window should be adjusted to the expected DMR lengths. Even if many CpG sites are covered over a wide genomic region (for example, in wholegenome bisulfite sequencing data), it is advisable not to choose too large CpG clusters with many CpG sites, when the expected DMR widths are much smaller, as this would decrease the power markedly (<ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>). Likewise, a wide smoothing window results in a weaker sensitivity to small DMRs. Moreover, the smoothing bandwidth should be adjusted to the choice of CpG clusters.<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Benjamini and Heller (2007)</ref>showed that the cluster testing procedure described earlier in the text controls the cluster-wise WFDR under independence or PRDS assumption, respectively. The procedure ensures that the cluster test statistics are Gaussian, and that the testing hypotheses are one-sided. Finally, to satisfy the PRDS property, the cluster test statistics have to be non-negatively correlated under the null hypothesis. We assume that this property is met in many cases for methylation data. Furthermore, it is important to note that the locationwise FDR is controlled asymptotically only, and DMR boundaries are slightly shifted by the smoothing step. However, we think that a targeted bisulfite sequencing approach primarily requires an analysis of the target units, e.g. CpG islands or gene bodies, rather than individual CpG sites. Besides, differential methylation typically is reported in terms of regions. This indicates a region-wise testing approach in the first place, followed by a CpG-wise detection tolerating more errors. This hierarchical testing procedure achieves a higher power than BSmooth and methylKit. The approach is tailored to targeted BS data. The direct use on whole-genome BS data would be feasible if the analysis was restricted on discrete genomic regions, e.g. on genes. We think that the two-stage testing procedure is applicable for other types of next-generation sequencing data as well. The histone modification H3K4me3 is known to occur in promoter regions primarily (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hebenstreit et al., 2011</ref>). Thus, promoters could be tested for differential histone modification between groups of samples in a first step and in bins (sub-regions) within rejected promoters in a second step. This is a point for further research.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig.1.</head><figDesc>Fig. 1. Methylation values for a selected region.

			<note place="foot">Methylation levels are strongly spatially correlated (Eckhardt et al., 2006), that is why local smoothing of the data is appropriate (Hansen et al., 2012; Jaffe et al., 2012). Hansen et al. (2012) showed that smoothing of raw methylation data can reduce the required sequencing coverage. DMR detection approaches without smoothing often discard CpG sites of low coverage from further analyses. Thus, the underlying spatial correlation allows using information from neighboring CpG sites, on the one hand, reducing the variance of the methylation levels especially for lowly covered CpG sites and, on the other hand, predicting methylation levels at CpG-sites missing any sequence reads to avoid missing values. Within each CpG cluster and for each sample, a smoothing function is modeled. For a given position x, the weighted local likelihood for methylation level y at position x</note>

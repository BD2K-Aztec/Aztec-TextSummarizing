				<p>Motivation: The lack of reliable, comprehensive gold standards complicates the development of many bioinformatics tools, particularly for the analysis of expression data and biological networks. Simulation approaches can provide provisional gold standards, such as regulatory networks, for the assessment of network inference methods. However, this just defers the problem, as it is difficult to assess how closely simulators emulate the properties of real data. Results: In analogy to Turing&apos;s test discriminating humans and computers based on responses to questions, we systematically compare real and artificial systems based on their gene expression output. Different expression data analysis techniques such as clustering are applied to both types of datasets. We define and extract distributions of properties from the results, for instance, distributions of cluster quality measures or transcription factor activity patterns. Distributions of properties are represented as histograms to enable the comparison of artificial and real datasets. We examine three frequently used simu-lators that generate expression data from parameterized regulatory networks. We identify features distinguishing real from artificial data-sets that suggest how simulators could be adapted to better emulate real datasets and, thus, become more suitable for the evaluation of data analysis tools. Availability: See http://www2.bio.ifi.lmu.de/$kueffner/attfad/ and the supplement for precomputed analyses; other compendia can be analyzed via the CRAN package attfad.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The analysis of expression data involves a range of bioinformatics tools. They are used for outlier removal and normalization (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fundel et al., 2008</ref>), for clustering (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Eisen et al., 1998</ref>), for finding relevant biological processes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Draghici et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Naeem et al., 2012</ref>) as well as for the inference and modeling of gene regulatory interactions (GRIs) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ku¨ffnerKu¨ffner et al., 2010</ref>). The improvement of such tools frequently depends on insights into properties of transcriptional regulation. To better understand such properties and to facilitate further tool development, several simulators have been developed for various areas of expression analysis. Another reason for conducting simulation studies is to provide gold standards that are not available for real data. In case of clustering, the number of gene clusters and the cluster–gene associations are usually not known for real data but can be defined easily within an in silico framework (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Wu et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Yeung et al., 2001</ref>). For the assessment of tools, it is important that simulators generate realistic expression patterns. Similar techniques are applied to analyze whether gene sets associated with biological processes exhibit a significant enrichment of differential expression. The assessment of enrichment tests on real data is difficult, as the genes or processes that exhibit differential activity between experimental conditions are usually not known before the actual experiment (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Naeem et al., 2012</ref>). As a remedy, enrichment tests can be assessed based on simulations of gene sets and their differential expression patterns (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ackermann and Strimmer, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Efron and Tibshirani, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Nam and Kim, 2008</ref>). Furthermore,<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Albers et al. (2006)</ref>generated realistic data and noise distributions to examine data normalization approaches for two-dye arrays. Simulators are also used to examine specific theoretical assumptions [e.g. expression data distributions (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Parrish et al., 2009</ref>), single-cell data (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hebenstreit and Teichmann, 2011</ref>) and theoretical properties of GRIs (<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Wu and Chan, 2012)]</ref>. Simulators devised for studying GRI inference approaches are again motivated by the need for complete gold standard networks. Unlike the specific simulators, network simulators claim to more generally satisfy the mentioned requirements. They imitate experimentally determined GRIs and their dynamical properties and emulate other properties of real data such as data and noise distributions (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Haynes and Brent, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Pinna et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Schaffter et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Van den Bulcke et al., 2006</ref>). Network simulators have been applied successfully to assess algorithms that reconstruct GRIs from expression data, e.g. via community-wide blind assessments (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Marbach et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Pinna et al., 2011</ref>). Therefore, simulators implement elaborate experimental settings, for instance, by dealing with biological and technical replicates and by generating data for gene knockouts, various perturbations and time series data (<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Schaffter et al., 2011</ref>). Some simulators also take into account sequence variations in promoter regions and coding sequences (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Pinna et al., 2011</ref>). Instead of random topologies, many simulators use realistic topologies, such as scale-free networks (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Haynes and Brent, 2009</ref>) or networks of experimentally determined GRIs (<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Schaffter et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Van den Bulcke et al., 2006</ref>). Algorithms can be benchmarked using simulators in a meaningful way if generated, and real data are sufficiently similar (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Haynes and Brent, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Pinna et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Schaffter et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Van den Bulcke et al., 2006</ref>). As this is difficult to show, in silico models are sometimes considered insufficient evidence for method enhancements. This is owing to our lack of a good understanding of the distribution of expression levels across the *To whom correspondence should be addressed. various biological states and the correlation between biological replicates (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rocke et al., 2009</ref>). The present study evaluates to which extent current state-ofthe-art simulators are able to generate realistic datasets and gold standards. We propose characteristic histograms to compare artificial and real expression compendia. The histograms are derived by applying a range of expression data analysis approaches. We provide data on our Web site and R software to apply the suggested analyses on the compendia examined in this article or defined by the user. The properties of real and artificial datasets thus become amenable to a mutual pairwise comparison. For the generation of artificial datasets, we focus on network simulators, as they are most frequently used in practice and most general in their scope.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">DATASETS</head><p>To compare real and artificial expression compendia, we obtained a range of datasets. This section briefly describes the real datasets and experimentally derived networks (see the cited original publications for more information). Artificial datasets and networks are described in the Methods section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Expression data</head><p>Four microarray compendia with several hundred microarray measurements were obtained for Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae from the M3D Database (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Faith et al., 2008</ref>) (denoted with index 1) and from the DREAM5 competition (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Marbach et al., 2012</ref>) (denoted with index 2). Measurements as well as annotations derived from these sources are already rendered comparable across different experiments and are thus suited to automated analyses. Besides wild-type measurements, experimental conditions represent (combinations of) drug, environmental and gene perturbations. Some of the drug or environmental perturbations are provided as time course measurements. We considered each time point as a separate condition. Each condition may contain multiple replicates. Before all analyses, we log 2-transformed the measurements. Each dataset is represented as an expression matrix M, where rows correspond to the genes and columns to the measurements, i.e. the element m i, j of this matrix is the jth measurement of the ith gene.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Gene regulatory networks</head><p>The topology of E.coli gene regulatory networks was taken from RegulonDB (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gama-Castro et al., 2011</ref>). RegulonDB is a database of gene regulatory relationships that are both experimentally validated and manually curated. The S.cerevisiae network was derived by large-scale Chromatin Immuno-Precipitation (ChIP) assays post-processed by<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">MacIsaac et al. (2006)</ref>. These large-scale networks cover only transcription factor–target gene (TF:TG) interactions and ignore other kinds of interactions, e.g. based on microRNA–target interactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Simulators and their areas of application</head><p>GeneNetWeaver (GNW) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Schaffter et al., 2011</ref>) generates mRNA readouts by simulation of transcription and translation via stochastic differential equations that are randomly parameterized to construct executable models. Additionally, measurement noise is added to the gene expression data after simulation. Regulation takes place at the transcriptional level only, i.e. other layers of regulation such as protein–protein interactions, metabolites or cellular states are not considered. Instead of random graphs, GNW uses the known biological GRI networks, e.g. from E.coli and S.cerevisiae, but removes auto-regulatory loops. GNW data do not vary over several orders of magnitude and, thus, correspond to log-transformed real data. Three levels of experiments are supported where the variability of simulated expression runs increases from level one to three. Technical replicates as the first level are based on the same model and parameterization; the generated data are distinguished by noise only. The second level models biological replicates by slight random increases or decreases of the basal levels of all genes. Finally, distinct conditions are applied to the simulation mimicking time course, (multi or single) gene deletion or gene overexpression experiments. This dataset was specifically designed to mimic the types of experiments performed in the DREAM5 E.coli dataset (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Marbach et al., 2012</ref>), which is comprehensively described (http://wiki.c2b2.columbia.edu/dream/index.php?title¼D5c4). The GNW dataset consists of 1643 genes, 195 of which are transcription factors, and 805 microarray experiments. Gene REgulatory Network Decoding Evaluations tooL (GRENDEL;<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Haynes and Brent, 2009</ref>), in contrast to GNW, does not directly derive the topology of the simulated gene regulatory networks from real networks. Instead, a topology is modeled that reproduces in-and out-degree distributions of real networks. Each simulated gene is paired with an S.cerevisiae gene to use experimental data, such as translation rate, protein decay rate, mRNA decay rate and mRNA transcription rate for the parameterization of a deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE) simulation. However, topology modeling does not guarantee that paired genes in the yeast network are similarly close in the modeled network. Owing to the lack of suitable data, parameters determining the dynamical properties of GRIs are chosen randomly. Genes may not only be regulated by transcription factors, but also by environmental signals that can have instantaneous effects on other genes. Measurement noise is added to the data according to a lognormal distribution. Thus, only technical replicates and experimental conditions are modeled, and biological replicates are not taken into account. Expression data were simulated for 100 genes across 300 measurements. This population was modeled by varying the efficiency of transcription and mRNA degradation across samples independently for each gene. The topology of the network is described by an exponential distribution for in-degrees and a power-law distribution for out-degrees and was fit to reflect the degree distributions of the transcriptional network in S.cerevisiae. GRENDEL uses the Systems Biology Markup Language ODE Solver library to deterministically integrate the ODEs that define the dynamical system. To the resulting expression data, simulated experimental noise is then added according to a log-normal distribution. SynTReN. The network topology of a simulation with SynTReN (Van den<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Bulcke et al., 2006</ref>) is constructed from subsets of the known gene regulatory networks from E.coli and S.cerevisiae, which is similar to GNW's approach. The differential equations used for the simulation are based on Michaelis–Menten and Hill kinetic equations and allow us to simulate independent as well as synergistic interactions. Although pre-generated datasets were used in case of GNW (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Marbach et al., 2012</ref>) and GRENDEL (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Haynes and Brent, 2009</ref>), we modeled a network of 300 genes with SynTReN and generated an expression compendium of 200 measurements using default parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">General approach to dataset assessment</head><p>We suggest a procedure for the extraction of individual dataset properties and their comparison across datasets that consists of four steps. We</p><p>(1) apply standard expression data analysis techniques,</p><p>(2) analyze the results to generate specific distributions,</p><p>(3) visualize the distributions by histograms and, finally,</p><p>(4) compare different datasets based on histogram overlaps.</p><p>Steps 1 and 2 depend on the details of the individual analyses (see next section), while steps 3 and 4 are the same across analyses. In step 3, we plot histograms from analysis-specific distributions. For each type of histogram, we manually picked the smallest number of histogram bins (between 20 and 100, this can be changed in the R-package) that appropriately displayed histograms for a property. Histograms are computed by equally distributing the bins between the lowest and highest values of the compared histograms. Unless noted otherwise, we plot normalized densities in the histograms where the bars receive an average density of 1. Although graphical representations enable the closer examination of histograms, the largest differences are identified via overlap scores. For each property (step 4), we calculate overlaps to compare pairs of histograms a and b by dividing the minimum density by the maximum density over n bins:</p><formula>overlap ¼ P n i¼1 minða i , b i Þ= P n i¼1 maxða i , b i Þ.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Characterization of dataset properties</head><p>For the comparison of datasets, we characterize various properties by specific histograms derived from quality measures and standard gene expression analyses (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>). Replicate noise histogram. Pearson's correlation coefficient is computed for all pairs of replicate measurements contained in a given expression compendium. For example, if a measurement is repeated four times, six pairwise correlations are computed. Correlations of all pairs of replicated measurements are combined into one histogram visualizing pairs of replicates which exhibit given intervals of. Intensity histogram. For this analysis, all intensity measurements from a given expression compendium are combined into one histogram visualizing measurements with particular expression intensities. Such histograms are important to evaluate how effective approaches for data normalization are. Range of gene expression. The expression range of individual genes is estimated from the difference between its 5% and 95% intensity quantiles observed in a given expression compendium. A corresponding histogram is created to show the histogram of gene ranges. Although a fold change of two is considered a substantial change in case of the real data, no such intuition exists in case of the artificial data that are scaled very differently. Therefore, we multiply the artificial ranges by a factor so that their median corresponds to the median of the compared real range histogram. Silhouette coefficient (two histograms). To evaluate cluster quality, we use hierarchical average linkage clustering (<ref type="bibr">Evisen et al., 1998</ref>), using Pearson's as the similarity measure. Clustering is performed separately for genes (using the corresponding expression matrix M) and microarrays (based on the transposed matrix M T ). The quality of the clustering at each of the successive node (i.e. gene or microarray) join steps is evaluated by Silhouette coefficients (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Rousseeuw, 1987</ref>) that compare the average within-cluster distances with the average between-cluster distance. Thus, this coefficient evaluates the tightness and separation of clusters. For a dendrogram consisting of n nodes, n – 1 Silhouette values are obtained. Hierarchical clustering illustrates properties of co-regulation in expression data, i.e. the emergence of gene expression patterns across different experimental conditions. TF and TG correlation (two histograms). To examine the correlation between TFs and regulated TGs, we generate three histograms. Correlation coefficients are calculated for (i) all pairs of genes, (ii) all pairs of a TF and an annotated target as well as (iii) all pairs of targets that are regulated by the same set of TFs. Histogram (i) thus represents the background distribution of correlations between arbitrary pairs of genes. Finally, two difference diagrams are generated to show the enrichment of TF–TG correlations as the difference between (ii) and</p><p>(i) and the enrichment of TG–TG correlations as the difference between (iii) and (i). The resulting difference diagrams depict to what extent highly correlated pairs are enriched (positive values) or depleted (negative values) for true TF–TG or TG–TG relationships. TF–TG correlations thus enable us to evaluate whether statistical dependencies exist between the expression levels of TFs and their targets (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Marbach et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Wu and Chan, 2012</ref>). Alternatively, TG–TG correlations estimate the degree of co-regulation induced in pairs of genes regulated by the same TFs. TF activity histogram. We determine the activity of TFs based on the expression profiles of their sets of TGs in the available GRI gold standard. Wilcoxon's nonparametric rank-sum method (WR test) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Mann and Whitney, 1947</ref>) is applied to test whether TF targets exhibit significant rank differences in comparison with other (non-targets) genes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Naeem et al., 2012</ref>). The ranks are derived by sorting the genes based on their z-transformed absolute expression, i.e. for each condition i, the expression level l i ðgÞ of gene g is transformed into a z-score z i ðgÞ via z i ðgÞ ¼ ðl i ðgÞ À mðgÞÞ=sðgÞ where m(g) and s(g) denote the mean and standard deviation of the expression levels of g, respectively. Afterthis transformation, particularly high or low levels of a given gene can be clearly distinguished from its average levels. The WR test results in P values that we correct via Benjamini–Hochberg's (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Benjamini and Yekutieli, 2001</ref>) procedure for multiple testing. Regulators are called active if they receive a corrected P50.05 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Naeem et al., 2012</ref>). For a given expression compendium, one histogram is constructed to show how many TFs are found active in particular subsets of the measurements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">RESULTS</head><p>We compare various properties between real and artificial datasets and find strong deviations (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>, heatmap). Properties and their deviations are discussed below in detail. Each subsection presents one type of property histogram and is exemplified in detail based on the data from one of the three simulators (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>). Results on the other simulators are briefly summarized at the end of each section (see availability for additional figures).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Simple data histograms (GNW)</head><p>Replicate noise histogram. We first examined the reproducibility of measurements via Pearson's correlation coefficient (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2a</ref>). In case of artificial data, variations between replicates are due to the noise that simulators add to the generated expression data. In comparison with the real data where most replicates exhibit a very high , replicate measurements in artificial data are substantially less correlated, which is due to excess amounts of added noise. In addition, real data usually include a number of outliers that show substantially lower correlations than the main distribution of replicate correlations. In contrast, no outliers were observed in case of artificial data where the peaks of the distributions were sharply bounded (see scatter plots as inset panels of<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2a</ref>). Intensity histogram. Although measured intensity histograms generally depend on the used microarray platform (arrays used in this study were performed on Affymetrix platforms), intensities usually exhibit positive values that are approximately normally distributed (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2b</ref>). In contrast, the simulated data histograms we examined were not normally distributed and peaked at an absolute expression level of 0. In addition, histograms derived from individual real microarrays show a much greater diversity as shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2b</ref>. Range of gene expression. In contrast to the overall histogram of expression intensities (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2b</ref>),<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2c</ref>visualizes the range of fold changes of genes. For instance, a value of 3 denotes the genes that exhibit fold changes of up to 8 between their 5% and 95% quantiles. While the distributions were sharply bounded in case of artificial data (with a peak at a fold range of 2), the real data exhibited a distribution with a long tail of genes covering a much broader spectrum of fold ranges., a gene model with three states is indeed sufficient to model all genes in the GNW dataset. However, in case of real data, the majority of genes could be suitably modeled with only two states (corresponding to the peak at 1 in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2c</ref>), while many genes require a larger number of states. A substantial number of genes showed fold ranges of 44.5 (132 of 4511 genes in E.coli) that accordingly exhibit !6 states. Deviational patterns described here for GNW also apply to GRENDEL. On the other hand, a closer examination of the histograms (see availability for corresponding plots) reveals that data generated by SynTReN actually resemble real data histograms in case of the intensity and gene range properties. However, SynTReN's replicate noise distribution is extremely broad and thus resembles neither the real data nor the data generated by other simulators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Cluster analyses (GRENDEL)</head><p>Silhouette coefficients. Functionally related genes show tight coregulation patterns in real datasets that are clearly separatedby the variance of their intensities, a low (5% quantile of variance) and a high variance (95% quantile) microarray were selected that are shown as dashed and dotted lines, respectively. In contrast, (c) depicts intensity ranges for individual genes, i.e. differences between the observed minimum (5% quantile) and maximum (95% quantile) expression for each gene from patterns of different biological functions (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Eisen et al., 1998</ref>). However, in artificial data, cluster quality measured by Silhouette coefficients is substantially lower both for gene and microarray clusters (<ref type="figure">Fig. 3a</ref>and b). Co-expression patterns only emerge in artificial data for gene sets that are predominantly controlled by the same transcription factor. The fact that transcriptional regulation is the only mechanism to generate co-regulation patterns might explain that they are less pronounced in artificial data and form unusual cluster structures (<ref type="figure">Fig. 3c and d</ref>). Similar to section 4.1, SynTReN yields a somewhat more realistic histogram for microarrays, while the gene cluster histogram is multi-modal and unlike the one shown for the real data. Again, the deviations between real data and GNW or GRENDEL are similar in both degree and shape.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Network analyses (SynTReN)</head><p>TF and TG dependencies. This and the subsequent section evaluate properties of GRIs. GRIs can be extracted from expression data in a simple but effective manner based on the correlations between TFs and TGs or between TGs and TGs (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Butte and Kohane, 1999</ref>). In turn, the feasibility of such an approach can be assessed by examining whether pairs with high correlation values are actually enriched in true TF–TG or TG–TG dependencies (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4a and b</ref>). The comparison between the histograms derived from artificial and real data revealed two important differences. First, the enrichment of GRIs at high correlation values was markedly stronger for artificial data indicating that GRI inference is easier than in case of E.coli data. Second, artificial data showed similar degrees of enrichment for positive and negative correlations (activating and inhibiting relationships), whereas we could only detect an enrichment for positive correlations in case of real data (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4a</ref>). Apparently, mostly activating relationships can be observed in the real data, which is consistent with earlier observations (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Naeem et al., 2012</ref>). TF activity histogram. The activity of transcriptional regulators such as TFs can be determined via statistical tests from expression changes exhibited by their targets (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4c</ref>). Strikingly, while the majority of TFs were found active in at least 10% of the real measurements, 50% of the TFs were never active in artificial profiles. Changes in TF activity are caused by transcriptional regulation only as other layers of regulation that could mediate such activity changes (e.g. protein modification) are neglected in current simulators. Note that such gene set enrichment tests are used analogously for the detection of active TFs as well as of differentially expressed biological processes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Naeem et al., 2012</ref>). As biological processes are typically not modeled in simulated datasets, we can still examine the performance of gene set enrichment tests via TF activities. For the network analyses described in this section, the remaining two simulators exhibit similar patterns of deviation that are even stronger as those shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>.<ref type="figure">3</ref>. Analysis of cluster quality. We grouped (a) genes and (b) microarrays by hierarchical clustering to examine the cluster quality via silhouette coefficients across all possible clusters. Cluster quality is consistently higher in real (here: E.coli, outline) than in artificial data (here: GRENDEL, filled). Individual gene clusters and corresponding gene profiles (see dendrogram for gene symbols matching the line color) are shown for two clusters that exhibit the highest silhouette coefficients, i.e. (c) for genes that code for ribosomal proteins in E.coli and (d) for artificial genes.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Organism comparison</head><p>Furthermore, we repeated the above analyses for a comparison between four real expression compendia compiled for E.coli and S.cerevisiae (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>, heatmap). Generally, the compared histograms exhibited differences that are substantially smaller than the deviations exhibited in the comparisons of real and artificial data described above. Although it is known that network inference is more difficult in eukaryotes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ku¨ffnerKu¨ffner et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Marbach et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Narendra et al., 2011</ref>), there are only little differences in the overall shape of E.coli and yeast histograms for TF–TG dependencies. However, in contrast to E.coli, a high correlation between TFs and TGs alone is not a good indicator for GRIs in yeast (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4a</ref>). This can also be observed in the heatmap of<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, where the three examined network properties show a similar degree of deviation between E.coli and S.cerevisiae on the one hand and the real and artificial datasets on the other hand.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Separability of real and artificial datasets</head><p>We tested several scoring schemes to show that differences between the property histograms of real and artificial datasets are statistically significant based on the t-test. Real and artificial data are significantly different for 10 of 12 property histograms. In contrast, alternative scoring schemes, such as Wilcoxon's test or the relative entropy, could distinguish datasets for substantially fewer properties. See section 1 of the Supplementary Material for more details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">DISCUSSION</head><p>Simulated datasets aim to bridge the gap to dependable gold standards that are required for the development and validation of tools across many expression data analysis steps. For the application to algorithm benchmarks, simulators should be able to emulate the properties of real data. To test this ability, we applied several important steps in gene expression data analysis ranging from clustering to the inference of GRIs. The results of these analyses were represented as property histograms for the comparison of real and artificial datasets. Data generated by three gene network simulators were compared with four expression compendia measured in E.coli and S.cerevisiae. We showed that property histograms facilitate the characterization and comparison of expression compendia. Most importantly, histograms were highly consistent across different real expression compendia and even between different organisms. In contrast, simulated data exhibited markedly different ranges of values and shapes. The captured properties thus clearly separated real and simulated data in analogy to Turing's test. We observed strong deviations even in basic intensity and noise histograms. These are likely due to simplified simulation models omitting steps that play a role in real measurements such as the modeling of mRNA concentrations and their quantification by optical detectors. We constructed further histograms from clustering approaches to compare resulting clusters of genes and experimental conditions. Artificial co-regulation patterns as detected by clustering are exclusively generated by transcriptional regulation, as this is typically the only regulatory mechanism implemented in current simulators. However, the most striking and reproducible (i.e. found in all examined simulators) deviations were observed for properties derived from gene regulatory networks. This is surprising, as the examined simulators were particularly devised for the assessment of network inference approaches. Many simulators aim to use realistic gene regulatory network topologies, e.g. sampled from experimentally derived GRIs, instead of random networks. However, other important layers of regulation such as different cellular states or signal transduction are neglected that in real data contribute to the complexity of expression patterns. Furthermore, executable models are constructed by arbitrarily selecting model parameters for the dynamic simulation of GRIs. Datasets generated in such a setup will differ substantially from real measurements even if realistic GRI topologies are used. Indeed, none of the different topologies(b), we examine to what extent TF–TG interactions and pairs of TGs regulated by the same TFs, respectively, can be identified based on correlation. Positive or negative differences in density [ordinate, non-continuous in (a)] indicate that the chances to detect true TF–TG or TG– TG relationships in the given correlation intervals are increased or decreased, respectively. Interactions were also analyzed for a yeast and an alternative E.coli dataset. In (c), the activity of TFs is inferred from the levels of differential expression exhibited by their TGs. Shown is the density (ordinate) of TFs active in a given fraction of the available chips. The leftmost histogram bin corresponds to a fraction of 0 and thus denotes TFs that are never found active implemented by the three simulators substantially reduced the observed differences to real data. Realistic data simulation requires a careful analysis of properties of network topologies, dynamic parameters and their relationship to the generated expression data. Our results suggest several improvements: (i) The expression model should be improved to produce normally distributed data in the range of typical expression measurement platforms, so that, for instance, fold changes have a similar meaning as in real datasets. The simulation of noise is important, but excessive noise levels should be avoided. (ii) The generation of realistic co-regulation patterns requires the emulation of groups of TFs, their combinatorial effects and the conditions for becoming active. (iii) As a related topic, we note that random parameterization (GNW, GRENDEL) or random mapping of experimentally determined parameters onto the network (SynTReN) is not adequate. Instead, an iterative optimization of model parameters could preserve dataset properties such as those that we described here. (iv) Simulators should implement regulation on the protein level. Currently, the simulation of just transcriptional regulation over-simplifies network inference, as all regulatory events become visible at the level of gene expression. (v) Finally, simulators should account for the diversity of genes, for instance, regarding the number of regulatory states, instead of assuming that one model is sufficient to generate all data. This would help to reproduce the broader distributions of properties derived from real data. Our approach (see availability for Web site and software) offers a detailed comparative analysis of expression data generated by real and artificial gene regulatory networks. Our assessment is based on typical data processing and analysis pipelines. We thereby provided an important layer of assessment on top of data simulators that are essential tools for both data analysis and network inference when no reliable gold standards are available. The analysis suggested several ways for improving current simulators to generate more realistic datasets.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig.1.</head><figDesc>Fig. 1. Overview of tested properties and corresponding areas of expression data analysis. Expression analyses were performed to compare four real and three in silico expression compendia. For each type of analysis, figures in this article use in silico data of a different simulator. Additional analyses were performed across all simulators (see Web site and R software for more figures), and corresponding results are shown in the heatmap on the right. In the heatmap, different analyses (rows) compare various pairs of datasets (columns; E.c. ¼ E.coli; S.c.¼ S.cerevisiae) based on histogram overlaps. The heatmap depicts the extent to which dataset properties are shared across compendia. Overlaps are shown in units of row-wise standard deviation (see online, red ¼ high, blue ¼ low overlap). In case of the three simulators, the average overlap to the four real expression compendia is shown. See section 4 for more details</figDesc></figure>

A log 2 fold range of 2 will correspond to three distinguishable gene levels if discrete sets are separated by a log 2 fold change of 1. As demonstrated by Ku¨ffnerKu¨ffner et al.

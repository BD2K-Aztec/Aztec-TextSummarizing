				<p>Motivation: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) aim to identify genetic susceptibility to complex diseases by assaying and analyzing hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Although traditional single-locus statistical tests have identified many genetic determinants of susceptibility, those findings cannot completely explain genetic contributions to complex diseases. Marchini and coauthors demonstrated the importance of testing two-locus associations allowing for interactions through a wide range of simulation studies. However, such a test is computationally demanding as we need to test hundreds of billions of SNP pairs in GWAS. Here, we provide a method to address this computational burden for dichotomous phenotypes. Results: We have applied our method on nine datasets from GWAS, including the aged-related macular degeneration (AMD) dataset, the Parkinson&apos;s disease dataset and seven datasets from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC). Our method has discovered many associations that were not identified before. The running time for the AMD dataset, the Parkinson&apos;s disease dataset and each of seven WTCCC datasets are 2.5, 82 and 90 h on a standard 3.0 GHz desktop with 4 G memory running Windows XP system. Our experiment results demonstrate that our method is feasible for the full-scale analyses of both single-and two-locus associations allowing for interactions in GWAS.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>In genetics, it has been well established that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with a variety of diseases. In the emerging genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the goal is to identify genetic susceptibility through assaying and analyzing SNPs at the genome-wide scale. While the analysis of susceptibility of individual SNPs has been standardized and led toin the two-locus association study. Class I: SNPs with a significant main effect and a significant interaction with a second SNP. Class II: SNPs with a significant main effect but without a significant interaction with any other SNP. Class III: SNPs without a significant main effect but with a significant interaction with some other SNP. Class IV: SNPs with neither a significant main effect nor a significant interaction with any other SNP. Class V: a subclass of Class IV, in which pairs of SNPs display significant associations via the combination of their main effects and their interaction effects. Please note that the first SNP and the second SNP in the definitions need not be in the same class. many interesting findings, these findings cannot completely explain the genetic causes of complex diseases. Consequently, identifying two-locus association patterns of complex diseases has attracted more attentions (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Marchini et al., 2005</ref>). In general, SNP association patterns in the two-locus association study can be partitioned into four classes based on the different combinations of main effects and interaction effects, as illustrated in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. Current works focus on finding SNPs in Classes I, II and III. As a result, many genetic determinants of susceptibility have been mapped. Two recent reviews (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Balding, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cordell, 2009</ref>) presented the detailed analyses on many popular methods, including traditional single-locus-based statistical tests (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Balding, 2006</ref>) and multi-locus analysis methods, such as the ones implemented in PLINK (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Purcell et al., 2007</ref>), multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Ritchie et al., 2001</ref>), Tuning ReliefF (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Moore and White, 2007</ref>), Random Jungle (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Schwarz et al., 2010</ref>) and BEAM (<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Zhang and Liu, 2007</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>X.Wan et al.</head><p>However, their findings cannot completely explain genetic contributions to complex diseases. Many researchers expect to detect more meaningful results by studying SNPs in Class IV. Although these SNPs neither display strong main effects nor significantly interact with other loci, some of them may influence diseases via the combination of main effects and interaction effects. This is referred to as two-locus associations allowing for interactions (formal definition in Section 2).<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Marchini et al. (2005)</ref>demonstrated the importance of testing associations allowing for interactions through a wide range of simulation studies. From a mathematical point of view, testing associations allowing for interactions enables us to detect a particular subset of SNPs in Class IV. We categorize this set as Class V in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, which is of our interests in this work. While various methods have been proposed to test two-locus associations allowing for interactions [see the recent review (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cordell, 2009)]</ref>, most of them fail to handle hundreds of billions of SNP pairs in GWAS. The main difficulty is the heavy computational burden. For example, in order to detect associations allowing for pairwise interactions from 500 000 SNPs, we need more than 10 11 statistical tests. Some progress has been made on this issue recently.<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Marchini et al. (2005)</ref>showed that it was computationally intensive but still possible to test two-locus associations allowing for interactions in GWAS. BEAM (<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Zhang and Liu, 2007</ref>) is another feasible method to detect associations allowing for interactions in the genome-wide scale. Zhang and Liu (2007) proposed a Bayesian marker partition model and used Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to optimize the posterior probability of the model. BEAM has successfully demonstrated its capability of handling large datasets using the synthetic data. But it did not provide convincing evidence using the real data. When the authors applied BEAM to analyze an aged-related macular degeneration (AMD) dataset consisting of 116 204 SNPs and 146 samples (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Klein et al., 2005</ref>), neither main effects nor interaction effects were reported by BEAM based on its B-statistic test. For many larger datasets such as those from Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC), BEAM is only feasible after a filtering stage based on the single-locus test (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cordell, 2009</ref>). Here, we provide a computational method to address this issue. We show that testing two-locus associations allowing for interactions of all SNP pairs in GWAS can be done in a fast manner. We also demonstrate the statistical power of our method on simulated datasets and the applicability of our method on nine real GWAS datasets including the AMD dataset (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Klein et al., 2005</ref>), the Parkinson's disease dataset (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Fung et al., 2006</ref>) and seven datasets from WTCCC (WTCCC, 2007). Our method discovers some associations that were not identified before. Currently, we only focus on finding two-locus associations allowing for interactions in casecontrol studies. We do not search for higher order interactions due to the following reasons:</p><p>(1) To detect strong interactions between SNPs with weak main effects (or even in the absence of main effects), the exhaustive search is needed. Evaluating all pairs has already imposed a computational challenge. The brute-force search for higher order interactions will be computationally prohibitive. Heuristic strategies have to be applied but without guaranteed performance.</p><p>(2) Sample size is another issue for detecting higher order interactions. For a d-order interaction, the contingency table has 3 d Ã—2 cells. Due to the limited sample size, there will be many empty (or close to empty) cells, which will lead to unstable estimation (large variance). This instability makes the identified result difficult to be reproduced by other independent studies.</p><p>In the following sections, we first provide a formal definition of testing two-locus associations allowing for interactions. Then we describe our test statistics based on log-linear models. We show that our proposed test statistics can be evaluated analytically. Based on these test statistics, we develop a stepwise strategy to detect both single-and two-locus associations allowing for interactions. The type I error of the proposed strategy is validated through the null simulation study.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Notation</head><p>Suppose a dataset includes L SNPs and n samples. X l is used to denote the l-th SNP, l = 1,...,L and Y is the class label (Y = 1 for cases and Y = 2 for controls). SNPs are bi-allelic genetic markers. In general, capital letters (e.g. A, B, â€¦) denote major alleles and lowercase letters (e.g. a, b, â€¦) denote minor alleles. For each SNP, there are three genotypes: homozygous reference genotype (AA), heterozygous genotype (Aa) and homozygous variant genotype (aa). The popular way of coding the genotype data is to use {1, 2, 3} to represent {AA, Aa, aa}, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Definition of two-locus associations allowing for interactions</head><p>There are two types of associations allowing for interactions.

The genotype counts in cases (Y = 1) and controls (Y = 2)These likelihood ratio tests based on logistic regressions are widely accepted. However, it is computationally demanding to evaluate hundreds of billions of SNP pairs in GWAS by directly using these tests. Therefore, faster test procedures without losing statistical powers are needed in GWAS. Noticing the equivalence between a logistic regression model and its corresponding loglinear model in categorical data analysis (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agresti, 2002;</ref>), here we propose to test two-locus associations allowing for interactions based on log-linear models. The advantage of so doing is that test statistics can be derived in the closed form.</p></div>

Although Poisson distribution may not be entirely suitable for the fixed sample size, it is still considered as a reasonably good approximation to a multinomial model. Such an approximation makes the mathematics tractable. Clearly, we have n = i, j, k n ijk. We use Ï€ ijk to denote the probability that an observation falls in the cell (i, j, k).

We use the dot convention to indicate summation over a subscript, e.g. Ï€ i.. = j,k Ï€ ijk is the marginal probability of X p = i and n i.. = j,k n ijk is the number of observations with X p = i.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RESULTS</head><p>In this section, we evaluate our proposed method using both simulation data and real data. It is also instructive to compare the empirical power of our method with some recent approaches. In<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cordell (2009)</ref>, BEAM was recommended as a very powerful one which could handle large-scale data and finish in a reasonable period of time. In addition, BEAM has been compared with MDR, the stepwise logistic regression and the logic regression (<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Zhang and Liu, 2007</ref>). BEAM outperforms all of them. Therefore, we focus on the comparison between our method and BEAM using simulated data generated from four popular epistatic models and nine real datasets, one from the AMD study (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Klein et al., 2005</ref>), one from the Parkinson's disease study (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Fung et al., 2006</ref>) and the other seven datasets from WTCCC. We also conduct the typical single-locus analysis (the details of our single-locus analysis are provided in Supplementary Section 1) and use its performance as the reference to display the improvement that the two-locus association analysis can achieve. To check the type I error of our method, we further design a null simulation study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Simulation experiment from four epistasis models</head><p>In this experiment, we select four epistasis models whose odds tables are given in the Supplementary Material. Model 1 is a multiplicative model considered in<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Marchini et al. (2005)</ref>. Model 2 is discussed in Neuman and Rice (1992) to describe handedness (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Levy and Nagylaki, 1992</ref>) 1 and the color of swine (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Lerner, 1968</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>with the significance thresholds selected as<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>). The total variance of simulation models is decomposed into two parts: the variance explained by main effects and the variance explained by interactions. The performances of the single-locus analysis and BEAM are expected to be consistent as what ANOVA indicates. Specifically, when main effects are noticeable, they perform reasonably well. When interaction effects dominate, they perform poorly. For all models, our method has a higher power on average because each model has an interaction effect. For Models 1 and 3 with MAF = 0.2, BEAM outperforms our method because the generated datasets contain noticeable main effects in those settings. The MCMC used in BEAM has a high chance to sample simulated true pairs if main effects are present. The B-statistic used in BEAM often has a higher power than the statistic used in the likelihood ratio test as demonstrated in Zhang and Liu (2007). However, for other settings with weak main effects, our method outperforms BEAM. The sample size plays an important role for all methods. The power increases a lot when the sample size increases from n = 800 to 1600.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Null simulation to test type I errors</head><p>To display type I errors of our method, we conduct the null simulation experiments. We generate 1000 null datasets. Each dataset consists of 1000 SNPs and 1000 samples. All SNPs are simulated independently with MAFs uniformly distributed in<ref type="bibr">[0.05,0.5]</ref>. We conduct two experiments on those null datasets, one using BIC in model selection and the other one without using BIC. The experiment results are provided in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>, from which we can see that the type I errors of our method using BIC agree with the nominal error rates while the numbers of false positives without using BIC are much higher. This results show that our model selection strategy plays an essential role in controlling the type I error at nominal error rate.</p></div>

The P-value of this association is 0.061 after the Bonferroni correction. These two SNPs have high-genotyping quality with only one missing genotype. The joint distributions of these two SNPs in cases and controls and the corresponding odds ratios are provided in<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>,<ref type="figure" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>and<ref type="figure" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>in the Supplementary Material. The genotype combinations 'CC/AA', 'CT/AG' and 'TT/AG' have significantly higher odds ratios than others genotype combinations. Please note that the significantly higher disease risk of 'CT/AG' is supported by larger counts in both cells than 'CC/AA' and 'TT/AG' (see details in the Supplementary Material). In addition, the genotype 'CT/AA' has a significantly low disease risk. SNP rs10519435 resides at the intron of gene LVRN (laeverin). Its neighbor gene SNCAIP has been strongly associated with the Parkinson's disease (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Engelender et al., 2000</ref>). SNP rs849523 resides at the intron of gene Neuropilin-2 (NRP2) which is a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor. It is a well-known gene associated with many cancers. The ligands of NRP2 are Class-3 semaphorins. In the nervous system, altered semaphorin function has been linked to Alzheimer's disease, motor neuron degeneration, schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease (<ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Williams et al., 2007</ref>). To our knowledge, this is the first identified association that can pass the statistical significance test for the study (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Fung et al., 2006</ref>). Although it is still unclear whether and how these genes jointly affect disease traits, this finding provides a clue to further analyze the dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Experiments on seven datasets from WTCCC</head><p>The WTCCC is a collaboration of many British research groups. In the first phase, the WTCCC has examined the genetic signals (500K SNPs) of seven common human diseases: bipolar disorder (BD), coronary artery disease (CAD), Crohn's disease (CD), hypertension (HT), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) (14 000 cases in total and 3000 shared controls). Before we run our method on these datasets, we first apply a similar quality control procedure as suggested in (<ref type="bibr">WTCCC, 2007</ref>) to preprocess the data. The numbers of remaining SNPs are roughly<ref type="bibr">, 2009</ref>). In contrast, our method has discovered many associations that were not identified before. The numbers of identified two-locus associations under three statistical significance thresholds with and without the distance constraint for seven diseases are reported in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>. The distance constraint is used to avoid associations involving two closely placed loci because the interaction effects in those associations may be attributed to the linkage disequilibrium (LD) effect (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cordell, 2009</ref>). Since people are more interested in associations induced by interactions between distantly placed loci and the significance threshold of 0.10 is widely accepted, we focus on the analysis of two-locus associations allowing for interactions under the threshold of Bonferroni-corrected P-value of 0.10 with the distance constraint. The details of these associations (including the statistical significance of single P-values and interaction P-values) are listed in the Supplementary Material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.1">RA All loci</head><p>in the identified three two-locus associations are located at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region in Chromosome 6. The MHC region has been confirmed as the most variable region in the human genome with respect to infection, inflammation, autoimmunity and transplant medicine (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Lechler and Warrens, 2000</ref>). The recent study (<ref type="bibr">WTCCC, 2007</ref>) has replicated the strong association between gene HLA-DRB1 and RA via singlelocus association mapping. Our result further replicates another strong association between gene HLA-B and the disease trait, which was previously reported in (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Galocha and de Castro, 2008</ref>). The identified association involves the locus rs4394275 interacting with the locus rs9276440. The P-value of this association is 0.059 after the Bonferroni correction. The locus rs4394275 resides at the intron region of gene HLA-B and the locus rs9276440 resides at the intron region of gene HLA-DQA2.

Previous reports (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Nejentsev et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">WTCCC, 2007</ref>) have identified strong associations between many MHC genes (such as HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DRB1) and T1D using the single-locus test. However, it is unclear which and how many loci within the MHC region determine T1D susceptibility. Our results provide additional information to help pinpoint disease-associated loci because SNPs involved in those associations are usually filtered out in the single-locus test. A further inspection of the 266 associations of our interest has identified two association regions which span from 30 010k bases to 30 065k bases and from 28 160k bases to 28 300k bases.

The locus rs9586155, located at the region q33.1 in Chromosome 13, is not well studied. Nor is it in the HapMap collection. The locus rs7031174 resides at the intron of gene MELK. MELK has been found significantly over-expressed in the great majority of breast cancer cells (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lin et al., 2007</ref>). It is well known that there are strong associations between T2D and breast cancer, and the insulin resistance has been connected to an increased risk of breast cancer (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Michels et al., 2003</ref>). Although breast cancer occurs mainly in women and thus this evidence may not indicate a direct connection between T2D and gene MELK, the investigation of genes interacting with gene MELK may help identify the causes of T2D.</p></div>

The P-value of this association is 0.042 after the Bonferroni correction. The locus rs10008294 is linked with the loci rs4312703 and rs10049995 of gene ANTXR2. The r 2 between rs10008294 and rs4312703 is 0.933 and the D is 0.966. The r 2 between rs10008294 and rs10049995 is 0.93 and the D is 0.964. Both rs4312703 and rs10049995 are included in the analysis.

BEAM is a recent method which can handle large-scale data. BEAM took about 8 days to handle 47 727 SNPs genotyped on around 5000 samples using 5Ã—10 7 MCMC iterations. A rough estimation implied that BEAM would take approximately 5 weeks to analyze 89294 SNPs genotyped on those 5000 samples (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cordell, 2009</ref>). Currently, BEAM fails to handle 500 000 to 1 000 000 SNPs genotyped on 5000 or more samples. Our method makes a significant progress in computational time. It evaluates two-locus associations allowing for interactions of all pairs of about 360 000 SNPs (i.e. 6.5Ã—10 10 pairs) within 90 h (within 4 days) on a standard desktop (3.0 GHz CPU with 4G memory running Windows XP professional x64 Edition system).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION</head><p>The development of our method is triggered by the limitations of existing works on detecting two-locus associations allowing for interactions from GWAS. Our method shares the same goal with Marchini's method (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Marchini et al., 2005</ref>). Both methods take interaction effects into account when detecting two-locus associations. Compared with Marchini's method, the novelties of our method are as follows:</p><p>@BULLET We develop a stepwise strategy to detect significant two-locus associations allowing for interactions. Our stepwise strategy involves three models: one full model and two partial models. Marchini's method only considers the full model.</p><p>@BULLET We use BIC to choose the best model among the three models to test two-locus associations allowing for interactions. This model selection process is critical to control the type I error. @BULLET Instead of working with logistic regression, we make use of the analytical solutions of some log-linear models, i.e. Equations (11, 9 and 13), so that the test statistics can be obtained in the closed form.</p><p>We have applied our method to analyze many datasets from GWAS and identified many undiscovered associations. Our method displays many advantages over existing methods: @BULLET It can detect two-locus associations allowing for interactions from genome-wide data in a fast manner.</p><p>@BULLET It does not assume any particular epistasis model. This is very important for real studies because the patterns of SNP interactions are generally unknown and could be complex.</p><p>@BULLET It can be extended into distributed and parallel computing to analyze the phase 2 datasets from WTCCC. One limitation of our method is that it can only detect associations between two SNPs and disease traits, while BEAM is able to detect higher order associations as well. There are several other issues that we have not addressed, such as population substructures, imputation of the missed genotypes and incorporation of covariates. In summary, our experiment results demonstrate that our method is more powerful than existing works in detecting two-locus associations allowing for interactions. It is also computationally feasible to test hundreds of thousands of SNPs genotyped in thousands of samples.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig.1.</head><figDesc>Fig. 1.

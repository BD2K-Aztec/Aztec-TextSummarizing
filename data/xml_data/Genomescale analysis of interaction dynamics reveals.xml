			<abstract>
				<p>Analyzing large-scale interaction networks has generated numerous insights in systems biology. However, such studies have primarily been focused on highly co-expressed, stable interactions. Most transient interactions that carry out equally important functions, especially in signal transduction pathways, are yet to be elucidated and are often wrongly discarded as false positives. Here, we revisit a previously described Smith–Waterman-like dynamic programming algorithm and use it to distinguish stable and transient interactions on a genomic scale in human and yeast. We find that in biological networks, transient interactions are key links topologically connecting tightly regulated functional modules formed by stable interactions and are essential to maintaining the integrity of cellular networks. We also perform a systematic analysis of interaction dynamics across different technologies and find that high-throughput yeast two-hybrid is the only available technology for detecting transient interactions on a large scale.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The protein–protein interactome of an organism is the network of all biophysically possible interactions of different proteins in that organism (<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Yu et al., 2008</ref>). It is of key importance to accurately map this network as most proteins function by interacting with other proteins (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Pawson and Nash, 2000</ref>). Moreover, a better understanding of genotype to phenotype relationships in human disease requires modeling of how disease-causing mutations might affect protein interactions and interactome properties (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Goh et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Wang et al., 2011</ref>). Currently, there are two main highthroughput technologies to generate high-quality protein–protein interactomes on a large scale: yeast two-hybrid (Y2H), where a protein interaction reconstitutes a transcription factor which then activates expression of reporter genes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Fields and Song, 1989</ref>), and affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry (AP/MS), where proteins bound to tagged baits are co-purified and identified (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Rigaut et al., 1999</ref>). High-throughput Y2H maps have been generated for yeast, fly, worm and human, while large-scale AP/MS datasets have * The authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the first two authors should be regarded as joint First Authors. been generated for yeast, worm and human (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Jensen and Bork, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Yu et al., 2008</ref>). An alternative approach, adopted by most databases, is to obtain literature-curated (LC) interactions (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Cusick et al., 2009</ref>). It has been shown that well-controlled Y2H and AP/MS experiments are both of high quality but of complementary nature— Y2H identifies direct binary interactions whereas AP/MS determines co-complex associations (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Jensen and Bork, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Yu et al., 2008</ref>). Moreover, gene expression and other functional genomics datasets are routinely integrated with protein–protein interactions to validate their biological relevance—for example, interactions between proteins encoded by co-expressed genes are often considered to be of high quality (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Ge et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Suthram et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">von Mering et al., 2002</ref>). In these analyses, gene co-expression is normally determined by a high Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), which really means that the expression levels of the two genes are correlated over most conditions, i.e. they are globally co-expressed (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1A</ref>). Previous studies have shown that interacting proteins within stable complexes also tend to be encoded by globally co-expressed gene pairs (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Jansen et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Yu et al., 2008</ref>). On the other hand, the regulation and coordination of the subcellular machinery is achieved by dynamic transient interactions for example in signal transduction pathways (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Jansen et al., 2002</ref>). Proteins involved in transient interactions are not globally co-expressed. Rather, they share local blocks of co-expression. Transient interactions and their dynamics have significant biological importance, but most genes in these pathways are often co-expressed only under certain conditions (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1B</ref>). As a result, these are usually discarded as false positives (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Ge et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Suthram et al., 2006</ref>). Here, we take advantage of a novel measurement of expression relationships (<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Qian et al., 2001</ref>) to directly distinguish stable from transient interactions on a genomewide scale in human and yeast and systematically analyze their topological and biological significance. We also evaluate different technologies in terms of their sensitivity in detecting interaction dynamics on a genomic scale.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Expression dynamics: global versus local co-expression</head><p>For our analysis, we created compendiums of gene expression and high-quality large-scale protein–protein interaction datasets for human and yeast (Supplementary Note SN1).Local co-expression B</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Interaction dynamics: stable versus transient</head><p>Next, to explore interaction dynamics across different technologies, we compared how successful different experimental techniques were in detecting stable and transient interactions. In agreement with previous studies, stable interactions within subcellular complexes show a strong enrichment of proteins encoded by globally coexpressed genes (Figs. 2A &amp; B, Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure SF1</ref>). On the other hand, although statistically significant, the enrichment of these globally co-expressed pairs is much less for binary interactions from both large-scale Y2H and LC sources. This lack of global co-expression has often been used as an argument to suggest that high-throughput Y2H interactions are of low quality (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Ge et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Suthram et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">von Mering et al., 2002</ref>). However, a recent study applied orthogonal assays to experimentally confirm that these binary interactions are in fact highly reliable (<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Yu et al., 2008</ref>). Figures 2C and D shows that in both human and yeast, Y2H is the only technology consistently able to identify transient interactions significantly more than random expectation. Surprisingly, binary interactions from the literature are not enriched with transient ones. Given the sociological biases within interactions from the literature (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Cusick et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Yu et al., 2008</ref>), there might be many compounding factors for this result. Stable interactions are easier to recapitulate under different experimental conditions, whereas transient interactions can only be tested under specific conditions. Therefore, transient interactions are more likely to be considered as false positives and not reported in the literature. In addition, in the post-genomic era, many candidate interaction partners arefirst identified based on gene expression and other genomic features favoring selection of stable interactions over transient ones. This result further highlights the importance of high-throughput Y2H because it is the only technology available to detect transient interactions, confirming that different protein interaction detection technologies capture different modes of biochemical interactions (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Jensen and Bork, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Yu et al., 2008</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Biological significance of transient interactions</head><p>To assess the biological significance of transient interactions as defined by our algorithm, we computed functional similarity of protein pairs involved in these interactions. We find that transient interactions are significantly enriched for proteins with similar functions and the fold enrichment is comparable to that of stable interactions in both human and yeast (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure SF2</ref>.). These results confirm the validity of our definition of transient interactions. We therefore provide the first method to systematically detect transient interactions on a genomic scale. Although our method might miss certain transient interactions, especially extremely transient ones that are virtually impossible to distinguish from random, our results confirm that those detected by our method are high quality and share significant functional similarity.</p><p>A good example of transient interactions identified by Y2H is the interaction between Sfb2 and Sec23. This interaction has been confirmed in vivo (<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Peng et al., 2000</ref>). Sec23 is a subunit of the COPII complex required for the budding of transport vesicles from endoplasmic reticulum (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Miller et al., 2003</ref>). SFB2 has a 56% sequence identity with SEC24, an essential component of COPII involved in cargo selection (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Miller et al. 2003</ref>). Overexpression of SFB2 can rescue the sec24 null mutant cells (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kurihara et al., 2000</ref>). Furthermore, it has been suggested experimentally that Sfb2 may recognize different export signals from those of Sec24 and may be used under non-normal growth conditions (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Miller et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Peng et al., 2000</ref>). These results agree with the expression dynamics revealed by our new analysis—SFB2 and SEC23 are only co-expressed during stress response (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3A</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Transient interactions key in maintaining network integrity</head><p>Traditionally, in network analysis, the focus has been on nodes. Hubs are crucial in maintaining the integrity of biological networks (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Albert et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barabasi and Albert, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Jeong et al., 2000</ref>). Interaction networks have two broad categories of hubs. Date hubs have low average PCC with their interactors and hold the key in maintaining the integrity of cellular networks, while party hubs have</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genome-scale analysis of interaction dynamics</head><p>high average PCC with their interactors and are often contained in tightly organized modules (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Han et al., 2004</ref>). We find that date hubs have a significant propensity to be involved in transient interactions (Figs. 3B &amp; 3C), suggesting that these play an important role in maintaining the integrity of the networks. To validate this result, we compared the edge 'betweenness' of global and transient interactions (Supplementary Note SN5). Edge betweenness can be used to detect community structure within networks (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Girvan and Newman, 2002</ref>). Clusters detected by this approach tend to share similar functions (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Dunn et al., 2005</ref>). We find that transient interactions for both human and yeast have a significantly higher betweenness than stable interactions (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3D</ref>). This implies that transient interactions hold the key in maintaining the integrity of the underlying cellular network. Disrupting these will partition the interactome into disjoint clusters, unable to perform temporally and spatially well-regulated processes. To further explore topological properties of transient interactions, we examined connectivity in response to progressive edge removal and found that selectively removing transient interactions increased characteristic path length much more sharply than selectively removing stable or random interactions (Figs. 3E &amp; 3F). Biological interactomes are small-world networks and removing a random edge is unlikely to significantly alter connectivity, as most random edges are not essential in maintaining network integrity (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Albert et al., 2000</ref>). However, selectively disrupting key edges disrupts network structure and increases the characteristic path length significantly. Since removal of transient interactions causes the sharpest increase in path length, these are indeed critical for network integrity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>Here, we utilize a previously described Smith–Waterman-like dynamic programming algorithm to segregate transient interactions from stable complexes on a genomic scale directly from gene expression data. For the first time, we distinguish their biological roles and show that although transient interactions are currently underexplored, they perform key biological functions and are essential to maintaining the integrity of cellular networks. Moreover, we find that Y2H is currently the only technology that is able to determine transient interactions on a large scale. Our findings are likely to generate significant interest in designing experiments to detect transient interactions to further explore their properties.</p></div>

			<note place="foot">(Qian et al., 2001). Details of the biological significance of each of these four categories can be found in Supplementary Note SN2. As the cell is in a different state at each of these time points, we are in fact measuring expression under different intracellular conditions. All datasets are carefully normalized to remove potential noise (Irizarry et al., 2003; Johnson et al., 2007; Luscombe et al., 2003; Yu et al., 2007b). We also compiled high-quality large-scale protein– protein interaction datasets for human and yeast spanning both high-throughput technologies—Y2H and AP/MS. We consolidated high-quality binary interactions in the literature from various databases (Supplementary Note SN3). Although traditionally these LC interactions are considered to be of high quality, recent studies have shown that many of them, especially those supported by only one publication, in fact tend to be false positives (Cusick et al., 2009). To remove unreliable interactions from our analysis, we carefully compiled comprehensive sets of high-quality binary LC interactions supported by multiple publications (named &apos;LCmultiple&apos;) for human and yeast. High-quality LC co-complex associations were obtained from MIPS (Mewes et al., 2011) for yeast and Reactome (D&apos;Eustachio, 2011) for human—two databases generally considered as gold standards for complexes in the corresponding organisms (Jansen et al., 2002; Lage et al., 2007). From these datasets, we first calculated the PCC for expression profiles corresponding to interacting protein pairs in the high-quality interaction datasets described above. For a pair of gene expression profiles, PCC reports the global correlation of expression levels across all conditions (Qian et al., 2001). A PCC value close to one indicates the pair of genes is globally co-expressed (Fig. 1A), whereas values close to zero indicate random, uncorrelated expression patterns. We find that the different interaction datasets for both human and yeast are significantly enriched for global co-expression as opposed to random gene pairs (Figs. 2A &amp; B). Since PCC is a linear correlation coefficient and certain coexpression relationships could be non-linear, we also used the maximal information coefficient (MIC) (Reshef et al., 2011) to explore global expression dynamics of the different interaction datasets in human and yeast. MIC belongs to a class of maximal information-based nonparametric exploration (MINE) statistics and has been shown to be very robust in detecting a wide range of associations both linear and not (Reshef et al., 2011). Using MIC, we revalidate the global expression dynamics captured by PCC–all the high-quality interaction datasets in both human and yeast have significantly enriched global co-expression as opposed to random gene pairs (Supplementary Figure SF1). Interacting protein pairs that have PCC greater than a certain cutoff (Supplementary Note SN4) are defined as stable interactions. However, gene pairs that are only co-expressed under certain conditions could have low and non-significant global PCC/MIC values. These often go undetected in the global nature of the computation, making global correlation an ineffective method for identifying condition-specific characteristics of transient interactions. To define dynamic co-expression relationships, we employed a Smith–Waterman-like dynamic programming algorithm as described previously (Qian et al., 2001). For each pair of genes and their expression profiles, this algorithm calculates local expression-correlation scores (LES) to find subsets of conditions with correlated expression levels (Fig. 1B). Interacting proteins that do not pass the global PCC cutoff but have high LES are defined as transient interactions (see Section 4).</note>

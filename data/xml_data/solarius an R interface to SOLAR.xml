			<abstract>
				<p>The open source environment R is one of the most widely used software for statistical computing. It provides a variety of applications including statistical genetics. Most of the powerful tools for quantitative genetic analyses are stand-alone free programs developed by researchers in academia. SOLAR is one of the standard software programs to perform linkage and association mappings of the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in pedigrees of arbitrary size and complexity. solarius allows the user to exploit the variance component methods implemented in SOLAR. It automates such routine operations as formatting pedigree and phenotype data. It parses also the model output and contains summary and plotting functions for exploration of the results. In addition, solarius enables parallel computing of the linkage and association analyses that makes the calculation of genome-wide scans more efficient. Availability and implementation: solarius is available on CRAN and on GitHub https://github.com/ ugcd/solarius.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Variance component (VC) models or linear mixed models are powerful tools for genetic studies particularly of quantitative traits. These models are attractive because they account for the contribution of individual genetic loci, while efficiently including polygenic and other confounding effects shared among individuals. Implementation of the VC methods has been traditionally a computationally challenging task, and SOLAR is one of the first and well-established VC tools that focuses on the analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in extended pedigrees (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Almasy and Blangero, 1998</ref>). solarius delivers to the R user three main quantitative genetic models: polygenic, linkage and association. The motivation to develop the solarius software came from the extensive experience of the group that studies the Genetic Analysis of Idiopathic Thrombophilia (GAIT) Project (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Soria et al., 2002</ref>). The first goal of solarius was to provide an effortless data manipulation in a polygenic analysis needed to be explored for such a large number of phenotypes. The second goal was to conduct the genomewide scans for both linkage and association mappings in an efficient way by means of parallel computing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Approach</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Implementation</head><p>The solarius package allows the import and export of data, automated manipulation of intermediate directories and configuration of SOLAR commands. The user works with top-level R functions which correspond to low-level SOLAR commands, as summarized<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. Each function performs the analysis with default SOLAR behavior, but the user can pass a specific configuration, for example, by means of polygenic.settings and polygenic.options arguments in the solarPolygenic function. The package has a number of benefits as a part of the R environment. The main functions returns output results as objects of S3 classes, for which print, summary and plot methods are defined. Pedigree relationships can be examined by plotPed and plotKinship2 functions based on kinship2 and Matrix R packages, respectively. The large tables of results from the association and linkage analyses are efficiently stored and accessed via the data.table R package. The results of the association analysis are explored with quantile–quantile (QQ) and Manhattan plots from the qqman R package. In addition, the rsnps R package is used to retrieve SNPs information by sending queries to public databases. Implementation of parallel calculations is straightforward, since the association and linkage analyses are implicitly parallel problems, and the R environment offers a number of packages with parallel interfaces (parallel, iterators and doParallel packages). The user needs to introduce only the parameter cores (the number of cores) to configure parallel computing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">A practical example</head><p>Here, we show an application of solarius package and place emphasis on its features by performing genome-wide QTL mapping for coagulation Factor XII (FXII) levels in the GAIT1 Project. The original work (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Soria et al., 2002</ref>) showed unequivocally that a locus in the F12 gene influences both FXII activity and susceptibility to thrombosis. The recruitment, phenotyping and genotyping methods used in the GAIT1 Project have been described extensively elsewhere (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Soria et al., 2002</ref>). High-quality genotypes at 363 DNA microsatellite markers spaced at a density of 9.5 cM and 299 695 SNPs were available for linkage and association mappings. The following three lines of R code performs polygenic, linkage and association analyses for FXII phenotype by calling the three main functions of solarius package. solarPolygenic (FXII $ AGE þ SEX, dat, covtest ¼ TRUE) solarMultipoint (FXII $ 1, dat, household ¼ FALSE, mibddir ¼ gait1.mibddir, cores ¼ 2) solarAssoc (FXII $ 1, dat, household ¼ FALSE, mga.files ¼ gait1.files, cores ¼ 2) All the three functions support the formula interface for fixed effects, similar to that of the standard linear regression lm function. The second argument of the functions is a data frame (dat) that contains not only phenotypic variables given in the formula and pedigree-specific identificators, but also optional proband and household variables for ascertainment and shared-environment corrections. The matchIdNames function defines the naming controls. Two mapping functions, solarMultipoint and solarAssoc, take input genetic data in a plain-text format of SOLAR. The user needs to prepare these data in advance likely using external tools and custom quality control pipelines. The mibddir argument specifies a directory with identity by descent (IBD) matrices. The mga.files argument takes a list of files with allele-dosage SNP data, optionally split into batches. solarAssoc function accepts also both genotype and allele-dosage data in PLINK and R data frame formats. The initial polygenic model included two fixed AGE and SEX effects and two random polygenic and household effects. The covariates were tested for statistical significance, as indicated by the covtest argument. Neither a covariate or a household effect was statistically significant at the 0.05 level and, thus, were excluded from the following models. The heritability in the final polygenic model was 0.64 6 0.08 with P-value 1:21 Â 10 À16. Both linkage and association scans identified the F12 gene locus at the genome-wide significant level. The mapping results on Chromosome 5 in<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>were produced by the default plot methods. Annotation of the association results based on rsnps package (annotate function) showed that the only significant SNP rs2731672 belongs to the F12 gene and tags the untyped causal 46C/T polymorphism rs180102 reported in (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Soria et al., 2002</ref>) (linkage disequilibrium measures are D 0 ¼ 1 and R 2 ¼ 1). A considerable speed-up of mapping scans can be achieved by parallel computing. Our computation time in minutes of FXII association mapping (average over 5 runs, standard error) was 264.1 (0.2), 132.2 (0.1) and 34.5 (0.1) on 2, 4 and 16 cores, respectively. The gains are closely proportional to the relative difference in the number of cores, as it is expected for implicitly parallel problems. More information on polygenic, linkage and association studies with solarius is on http://ugcd.github.io/solarius/vignettes/tutorial.html.The high-level functions of the package (column 3) correspond to the low-level SOLAR commands (column 2). The results of an analysis are extracted from SOLAR output files and stored in elements of the returned objects in R (column 4). The main elements contain results for covariates (cf), variance components (vcf), likelihood statistics (lf), SNP associations (snpf) and logarithm of odds (LOD) scores (lodf and lodf2 for the first and the second passes, respectively).<ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>.

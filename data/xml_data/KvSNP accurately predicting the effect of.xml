				<p>Motivation: Non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels cause diseases with potentially fatal consequences in seemingly healthy individuals. Identifying disease-causing genetic variation will aid presymptomatic diagnosis and treatment of such disorders. NsSNP-effect predictors are hypothesized to perform best when developed for specific gene families. We, thus, created KvSNP: a method that assigns a disease-causing probability to Kv-channel nsSNPs. Results: KvSNP outperforms popular non gene-family-specific methods (SNPs&amp;GO, SIFT and Polyphen) in predicting the disease potential of Kv-channel variants, according to all tested metrics (accuracy, Matthews correlation coefficient and area under receiver operator characteristic curve). Most significantly, it increases the separation of the median predicted disease probabilities between benign and disease-causing SNPs by 26% on the next-best competitor. KvSNP has ranked 172 uncharacterized Kv-channel nsSNPs by disease-causing probability.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>One in every 300 bases of human DNA shows variation between individuals. These sites are called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs;<ref type="bibr">The International HapMap Consortium, 2003</ref>). Distinguishing benign SNPs (bSNPs) from those that cause disease (dcSNPs) is a key premise for personalized medicine, but with a total of 10 million polymorphic loci within the genome it is no trivial feat. Efforts are often focused on identifying SNPs responsible for specific diseases (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kapa et al., 2009</ref>), or all dcSNPs within certain genomic regions (<ref type="bibr" target="#b51">The ENCODE Consortium, 2007</ref>) or genes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Splawski et al., 2000</ref>); for example, identifying dcSNPs within the voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel genes, where genetic variation has been shown to cause, or be associated with, cardiac arrhythmogenesis, for which the first presenting symptom can be sudden cardiac death. Genetic screening of a Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) cohort of 262 patients revealed that 59% had at least 1 minor allele in a Kv-channel gene (<ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Splawski et al., 2000</ref>). An additional concern with arrhythmogenesis is that individuals with certain genetic backgrounds (including Kv-channel genotypes) can acquire it when administered with certain drugs (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anantharam et al., 2003</ref>). Furthermore, SNPs in Kv-channel genes also cause, or predispose individuals to, various neurological disorders including epilepsy (<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kaneko et al., 2002</ref>), neuromyotonia (<ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Poujois et al., 2006</ref>) and episodic ataxia (<ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Scheffer et al., 1998</ref>), as well as other diseases, such as deafness (<ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kubisch et al., 1999</ref>). While not directly fatal, these disorders would still benefit from pre-symptomatic diagnosis and treatment. Association studies have previously been used to identify Kvchannel dcSNPs (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kapa et al., 2009</ref>), but there is concern that some variants may be incorrectly assigned because study cohorts were not large enough to infer statistical significance (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ackerman et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kääb and Schulze-Bahr, 2005</ref>). Results are also confounded by multiple testing errors, and the fact that compound SNPs are likely to cause, or contribute to, disease (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Brookes, 1999</ref>). Variable phenotype penetrance and severity is observed in arrhythmia patients harboring the same Kv-channel SNP (<ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Scicluna et al., 2008</ref>), suggesting that phenotypic modifier genes and/or variants exist (<ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Schwartz et al., 2003</ref>). Ranking SNPs by disease-causing probability would (i) prioritize variants for further examination and (ii) aid identification of phenotype-modifying variants. This is made even more relevant by the current sequencing revolution, where advances in high-throughput technology have facilitated genotyping to an unprecedented depth at affordable costs; resulting in a plethora of data that some are finding hard to analyse fast enough (<ref type="bibr">Editorial, 2008</ref>). Computational methods to predict whether nsSNPs will cause disease were originally based on empirical rules (<ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Ng and Henikoff, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Ramensky et al., 2002</ref>) but now tend to use machine learning approaches (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Calabrese et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Jiang et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Krishnan and Westhead, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Yue and Moult, 2006</ref>). Variants of known consequence are used to train the machine learning predictor, which finds patterns within the annotated nsSNP attributes that best classify the data into in their constituent groups: dcSNPs and bSNPs. Once trained, the predictor can be applied to uncharacterized variants, emitting the likelihood that they are disease causing. This approach has resulted in prediction accuracies of up to 82% (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Calabrese et al., 2009</ref>), but there is some evidence that performance can be improved if the machine learning model is built for a specific gene</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>L.F.Stead et al.</head><p>family. This is hypothesized to be due to the gene family specific weighting of variant attributes within the model, and the ability to include attributes that are biologically relevant to those genes and/or protein products (<ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Torkamani and Schork, 2007</ref>). To test this, we built an nsSNP prediction method specifically for Kv-channel genes, KvSNP, and optimized it with respect to the learning features and machine learning method. KvSNP outperforms the leading genomewide SNP effect prediction method with increased separation of bSNPs and dcSNPs in probability space. The latter is particularly pertinent as the trust placed in the accuracy of disease annotation in training datasets for SNP-effect predictors is a point of concern (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Care et al., 2007</ref>), especially for complex diseases where multiple SNPs are expected to contribute to disease phenotype, thus confounding, or removing, the ability to classify individual variants as disease causing or benign (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ackerman et al., 2003</ref>). Genetic characterization of Kv-channels will aid presymptomatic diagnosis and treatment of diseases such as cardiac arrhythmia. To this end, we have used KvSNP to predict the disease-causing ability of 172 uncharacterized nsSNPs and present case studies regarding those predictions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">The Dataset</head><p>Data on characterized nsSNPs were collated from Uniprot 13 (The UniProt<ref type="bibr">Consortium, 2009</ref>), the Human Gene Mutation Database: HGMD Professional 2009.2 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Stenson et al., 2009</ref>), MutDB (<ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Singh et al., 2008</ref>) and manual extraction from research papers (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table S1</ref>). A dcSNP annotation (irrespective of the disease) was assigned if concluded by (i) the genotype–phenotype database curators and/or (ii) the authors of the research papers. Conflicting annotations were resolved by assigning that given by the largest and most statistically robust study. Truncation mutations were not included as all were annotated as disease causing, hence the machine learning method would be unable to learn from them. This resulted in 1009 dcSNPs and 113 bSNPs. To increase the number of bSNPs, we added to them by identifying single nucleotide differences between human and homologous mammalian Kv genes (&gt;90% sequence identity) that result in a change in protein sequence, the assumption being that fixed evolutionary changes are neutral. Such 'divergent' datasets have been used in similar ways previously (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Care et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Sunyaev et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Yue and Moult, 2006</ref>) and independent Kv-channel research into disease susceptibility has shown that a human nsSNP that is present in a homologue is unlikely to be disease causing (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Jackson and Accili, 2008</ref>). Our final dataset consisted of 1009 dcSNPs and 782 bSNPs, of which 100 dcSNPs and 76 bSNPs (∼10%) were removed to form a blind test dataset. This data removal was performed at random but multiple variant protein products resulting from a single genetic variation (owing to alternative splicing) were filtered to ensure they were wholly contained in either the training or test data. The remaining training dataset consisted of 706 bSNPs and 909 dcSNPs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Learning features</head><p>A total of 14 nsSNP attributes were used as learning features; summarized in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>.

Hidden Markov Model (HMM) sequence profiles, created using HMMER (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Eddy, 1998</ref>), were used to assign two additional features: change in HMM score and change in HMM E-value, which quantify how an nsSNP alters a sequence's fit to the modelled profile (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Clifford et al., 2004</ref>).The protein region where the variant occurs (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>) loc</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">KvSNP predictions on uncharacterized nsSNPs</head><p>We applied KvSNP to the uncharacterized variants and ranked the results in descending order of disease-causing probability (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S2</ref>). An additional literature search, in an attempt to verify our predictions, did not reveal that any of these variants have been statistically classified since we collated our dataset. However, there were several findings worthy of note. KCNQ1 H105L (NM_000218.2:c.381C&gt;A): this was identified in a single individual during a gene mutation screening of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) victims (<ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Wedekind et al., 2006</ref>). SIDS has been linked to cardiac arrhythmia (<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Makielski, 2006</ref>). Electrophysiological characterization did not reveal any alteration in channel function in vitro, but KvSNP predicted this to be a disease causing SNP with a probability [p(dcSNP)] of 1.0. We believe this variant should be investigated further in vivo to ascertain if it should be part of clinical genetic screening. KCNA5 G182R (NM_002234.2:c.544G&gt;A) and E211D (NM_002234.2:c. 633G&gt;C): both observed in heterozygous form in patients (2 per variant) suffering idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Remillard et al., 2007</ref>). The cohort numbers used in this study are not sufficient to statistically assign the nsSNPs as disease causing, hence electrophysiological assays were carried out. The assays revealed that G182R significantly changes certain channel properties (inactivation kinetics and protein levels) with respect to wild-type, whereas E211D does not (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Burg et al., 2010</ref>). KvSNP predicts that KCNA5 G182R is disease causing [p(dcSNP) = 1.0], whereas E211D is not [p(dcSNP) = 0]. G182R should, thus, be investigated further in vivo. KCNH2 A1116V (NM_000238.2:c.3347C&gt;T ): implicated as a latent LQTS causal variant, benign unless KCNH2 K897T (NM_000238.2:c.2690A&gt;C) is also present (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Crotti et al., 2005</ref>). KvSNP assigns a p(dcSNP) of 0.26, highlighting the benefit of assigning a probability, as opposed to just a class; variants can be ranked in the order of disease-causing susceptibility. KCNH2 A1116V is predicted to be benign (0 ≤ p(dcSNP) &lt; 0.5) but variants ranked highly among the bSNPs are hypothesized to be those most likely to act as genetic modifiers. A1116V is in the top 25% of the uncharacterized variants predicted to be benign (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S2</ref>), which concurs with our hypothesis. We could not make an unbiased prediction for KCNH2 K897T as this variant was included in our training dataset.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig.1.</head><figDesc>Fig. 1.

Conservation scoring and HMM creation require multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) which were created as we detailed previously (Stead et al., 2010). The majority of Kv-channel LQTS-causing variants reside within the transmembrane segments (Ackerman et al., 2003) and our previous research has revealed significant associations between diseasecausing probability and location of nsSNPs, and hence topological location (Fig. 1) was included, assigned as per Stead et al. (2010). Structure-based learning features can improve SNP-effect predictors (Krishnan and Westhead, 2003), hence we built homology models in Modeller (Sali and Blundell, 1993), using the only resolved high-resolution Kv-channel structure (2R9R: Long et al., 2007) and predict how each nsSNP changes stability and solvent accessibility using PoPMuSiC2.0, which is both fast and accurate (Dehouck et al., 2009). Changes in physiochemical property at the variant locus may also disrupt to local interactions, hence changes in mass, hydrophobicity and isoelectric point were extracted from Biro (2006). Secondary structure and solvent accessibility were also predicted from sequence alone, using SABLE (Adamczak et al., 2005), a popular programme for protein structure analysis (Gromiha et al., 2010). Subfamily membership was included owing to its predictive power when included in a kinase-specific SNP effect prediction method (Torkamani and Schork, 2007).</note>

			<note place="foot" n="5"> DISCUSSION Genetic characterization of Kv-channels is required to identify SNPs that cause cardiac arrhythmia, a disease with potentially fatal consequences for seemingly healthy individuals and other serious diseases. We have created KvSNP: a machine learning classifier that is applied to Kv-channel nsSNPs to predict the likelihood that the variant causes disease. Alternative types of mutation are also known to cause disease in Kv-channels, and these are reported on KvDB (Stead et al., 2010), but too few are characterized to facilitate a machine learning approach for their predicted effect. We found that five learning features optimized KvSNP&apos;s performance. Two of these (cons and HMM) are evolutionary descriptors, concurring with previous findings that evolutionary metrics increase predictive power (Care et al., 2007; Jiang et al., 2006), and one is subfamily membership, a feature also included upon creation of a specific nsSNP-effect predictor for the kinase gene family (Torkamani and Schork, 2007). This indicates that gene-family-specific features are important in creating prediction methods, and their inclusion is likely to be part of the reason that KvSNP outperformed alternative genome-wide nsSNP-effect predictors. It should also be noted that we could not verify whether the machine learning based generic nsSNP-effect predictor, SNPs&amp;GO, was trained using any of the blind test data: a fact that would give it an advantage over our method. Misclassification of SNPs in the training data, a concern with complex disease phenotypes, creates noise in the training dataset, making the machine learning task of discriminating and separating the classes more difficult. We show that KvSNP is best able to separate bSNPs and dcSNPs in probability space, compared with genome-wide predictors, indicating its robustness to noise in the training data, and resulting in disease-causing probabilities that are easier for users to interpret. Overall, this concurs with the 2007 findings of Torkamani and Schork: that gene-familyspecific nsSNP-effect predictors are more accurate than genomewide methods, justifying their creation at a time when the number of novel nsSNPs, in need of characterization, is set to rapidly increase. 6 CONCLUSION KvSNP is better at discerning the outcome of Kv-channel nsSNPs than genome-wide methods, and is able to discriminate between classes of nsSNPs more effectively. The inclusion of evolutionary descriptors in two of five learning features used highlights the predictive power of such metrics. We have used KvSNP to make predictions on, and thus rank 172 uncharacterized Kv-channel gene nsSNPs to prioritize them for future genetic association studies and identify potential genetic modifiers of phenotype. The KvSNP software and our test and training data are available for download at www.bioinformatics.leeds.ac.uk/KvDB/KvSNP.html.</note>

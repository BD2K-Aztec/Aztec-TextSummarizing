				<p>Motivation: Computational RNA structure prediction is a mature important problem that has received a new wave of attention with the discovery of regulatory non-coding RNAs and the advent of high-throughput transcriptome sequencing. Despite nearly two score years of research on RNA secondary structure and RNA–RNA interaction prediction, the accuracy of the state-of-the-art algorithms are still far from satisfactory. So far, researchers have proposed increasingly complex energy models and improved parameter estimation methods, experimental and/or computational, in anticipation of endowing their methods with enough power to solve the problem. The output has disappointingly been only modest improvements, not matching the expectations. Even recent massively featured machine learning approaches were not able to break the barrier. Why is that? Approach: The first step toward high-accuracy structure prediction is to pick an energy model that is inherently capable of predicting each and every one of known structures to date. In this article, we introduce the notion of learnability of the parameters of an energy model as a measure of such an inherent capability. We say that the parameters of an energy model are learnable iff there exists at least one set of such parameters that renders every known RNA structure to date the minimum free energy structure. We derive a necessary condition for the learnability and give a dynamic programming algorithm to assess it. Our algorithm computes the convex hull of the feature vectors of all feasible structures in the ensemble of a given input sequence. Interestingly, that convex hull coincides with the Newton polytope of the partition function as a polynomial in energy parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach toward computing the RNA Newton polytope and a systematic assessment of the inherent capabilities of an energy model. The worst case complexity of our algorithm is exponential in the number of features. However, dimen-sionality reduction techniques can provide approximate solutions to avoid the curse of dimensionality. Results: We demonstrated the application of our theory to a simple energy model consisting of a weighted count of A-U, C-G and G-U base pairs. Our results show that this simple energy model satisfies the necessary condition for more than half of the input unpseudo-knotted sequence–structure pairs (55%) chosen from the RNA STRAND v2.0 database and severely violates the condition for $13%, which provide a set of hard cases that require further investigation. From 1350 RNA strands, the observed 3D feature vector for 749 strands is on the surface of the computed polytope. For 289 RNA strands, the observed feature vector is not on the boundary of the polytope but its distance from the boundary is not more than one. A distance of one essentially means one base pair difference between the observed structure and the closest point on the boundary of the polytope, which need not be the feature vector of a structure. For 171 sequences, this distance is larger than two, and for only 11 sequences, this distance is larger than five.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Computational RNA structure and RNA–RNA interaction prediction have always been important problems, particularly now that RNA has been shown to have key regulatory roles in the cell (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bartel, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Brantl, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Gottesman, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hannon, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Storz, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Wagner and Flardh, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Zamore and Haley, 2005</ref>). Furthermore, with the advent of synthetic biology at the whole organism level (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gibson et al., 2010</ref>), high-throughput accurate RNA engineering algorithms are required for both in vivo and in vitro applications (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Seeman, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Seeman and Lukeman, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Simmel and Dittmer, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Venkataraman et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Yin et al., 2008</ref>). Since the dawn of RNA secondary structure prediction nearly two score years ago (<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Tinoco et al., 1973</ref>), the research community has proposed increasingly complex models and algorithms, hoping that refined features together with better methods to estimate their parameters would solve the problem. Early approaches considered mere base pair counting, followed by the Turner thermodynamics model, which was a significant leap forward. Recently, massively feature-rich models empowered by parameter estimation algorithms have been proposed, but they provide only modest improvements. Despite significant progress in the last three decades, made possible by the work of<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Mathews et al. (1999)</ref>on measuring RNA thermodynamic energy parameters and the work of several groups on novel algorithms (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bernhart et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chitsaz et al., 2009a, b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dirks and Pierce, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">McCaskill, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Nussinov et al., 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Rivas and Eddy, 1999</ref>;<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Waterman and Smith, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Zuker and Stiegler, 1981</ref>) and machine learning approaches (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Andronescu et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Do et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zakov et al., 2011</ref>), the RNA structure prediction accuracy has not reached a satisfactory level yet (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rivas et al., 2012</ref>). Why is it so? Up to now, human intuition and computational convenience have led the way. We believe that human intuition has to be equipped with systematic methods to assess the suitability of a given energy model. Surprisingly, there is not a single method to assess whether the parameters of an energy model are learnable. We say that the parameters of an energy model are learnable iff there exists at least one set of such parameters that renders every known RNA structure to date, determined through radiograph or NMR, the minimum free energy structure. Equivalently, we say that the parameters of an energy model are learnable iff 100% structure prediction accuracy can be achieved when the training and test sets are identical. The first step toward high-accuracy structure prediction is to make sure that the *To whom correspondence should be addressed. ß The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press.

In this work, we provide a necessary condition for the learnability and an algorithm to verify it. The problem of learnability was previously studied for sequence alignment using similar methods (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dewey et al., 2006</ref>). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach toward a systematic assessment of the suitability of an energy model for RNA structure prediction. Note that a successful RNA folding algorithm needs to have the generalization power to predict unseen structures as well. However, if an energy model is inherently incapable of predicting known structures correctly, then it does not matter if it has the generalization power. We leave analysis of the generalization power for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">BACKGROUND</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">RNA secondary structure models</head><p>An RNA secondary structure model is often a context-free grammar together with a scoring function for either the rules, in the case of stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Eddy and Durbin, 1994</ref>), or the alphabet, in the case of thermodynamics models (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Mathews et al., 1999</ref>). Such scoring functions induce scoring on the entire generated language. The word with optimal score then yields a predicted structure for the given sequence. For the sake of brevity, we focus on thermodynamics models in this article, but it is obvious that our methods apply to other models including SCFG as well. In our context, the scoring function is the thermodynamics free energy. A secondary structure y of a nucleic acid is decomposed into loops, a free energy is associated with every loop in y and the total free energy G for y is the sum of loop free energies (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Mathews et al., 1999</ref>). The same loop decomposition principle applies to interacting nucleic acids such that the total free energy G is still the sum of the free energies of loops and interaction components (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chitsaz et al., 2009b</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Estimation of energy parameters</head><p>Generally, RNA structure prediction algorithms are divided into probabilistic and non-probabilistic categories. Besides machine learning approaches for the probabilistic methods, e.g. SCFGs, which are evaluated in (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rivas et al., 2012</ref>), existing machine learning algorithms for parameter estimation in the non-probabilistic RNA structure prediction can be grouped into two categories: Likelihood-based methods, where the maximum likelihood or maximum conditional likelihood principle is used to estimate the parameters of the model (e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Do et al., 2006</ref>); and Large-margin methods, where the model parameters are estimated to maximize the margin between the score of the true structure and the second best structure. This has been done using an online passive-aggressive training algorithm (<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zakov et al., 2011</ref>) and Iterative Constraint Generation (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Andronescu et al., 2007</ref>). The likelihood-based techniques estimate the best Gibbs distribution, which not only assists in predicting the best secondary structure but also is used in determining the thermodynamic parameters. Besides some probabilistic methods (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rivas et al., 2012</ref>), one of the most successful methods for learning the thermodynamics of RNA has been the MCL method, as in CONTRAfold (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Do et al., 2006</ref>), which maximizes the probability of RNA structures y given RNA sequences x for the training set D. That is, the conditional log likelihood of the training data (using the Boltzmann distribution) is maximized to estimate the best model parameters h Ã 2 R k :</p><formula>h Ã :¼ arg max h LðD; hÞ ¼ max h X ðx, yÞ2D</formula><p>logpðyjx, hÞ ð1Þ pðyjx, hÞ :¼ e ÀGðx, y, hÞ=RT Qðx, hÞ ð2Þ where k denotes the number of different motifs defined in the energy model, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, Gðx, y, hÞ is the free energy andGðx, s, hÞ :¼ cðx, sÞ, h ð4Þ is a linear function of the parameters h where cðx, sÞ 2 Z k is the features vector. The best performing method for RNA STRAND v2.0 is Contextfold (<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zakov et al., 2011</ref>). However, Contextfold performs worse than other methods in other datasets that are structurally different from RNA STRAND v2.0 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rivas et al., 2012</ref>). Essentially, it seems that Contextfold suffers from overfitting because it uses a myriad of features in its model. A systematic evaluation of the learnability using our algorithm in this article may help design a more concise set of features that is powerful enough to achieve high accuracy but not too powerful to suffer from overfitting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">LEARNABILITY</head><p>The question that we ask before parameter estimation is 'does there ever exist parameters h y such that for every ðx, yÞ 2 D, y ¼ arg min s Gðx, s, h y Þ?' If the answer to this question is no, then there is no hope that one can ever achieve 100% accuracy using the given model. The answer reveals inherent limitations of the model, which can be used to design improved models. We provide a necessary condition for the existence of h y and a dynamic programming algorithm to verify it through computing the Newton polytope for every x in D. We will define the RNA Newton polytope below. Not only our algorithm provides a binary answer, it also quantifies the distance from the boundary. For our 3D model, this distance roughly captures the difference between the number of base pairs in the observed structure and the number of base pairs in the closest point on the boundary of the polytope. Note that the closest point on the boundary of the polytope need not be the feature vector of a structure.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Relation to the Newton polytope</head><p>In addition to D, the set of experimentally determined structures, we often have a repository of thermodynamic measurements, e.g. melting curves, which can help better estimate the energy parameters. Currently, optical melting measurements are analyzed using a two-state model (<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Siegfried and Bevilacqua, 2009</ref>). However, a more accurate analysis of such melting experiments can be done through relating the measurements to the energy parameters through equations involving the partition function and its derivatives with respect to temperature (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chitsaz et al., 2009b</ref>). We show that with a change of variables, the partition function becomes a polynomial. Therefore, such equations become a system of polynomial equations the solving of which algebraically requires computation of the Newton polytope of each polynomial (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Emiris, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Emiris and Canny, 1995</ref>).

The following lemma allows us to formulate a divide-and-conquer strategy for computing the Newton polytope, which will in turn lead to our dynamic programming algorithm.</p><p>LEMMA 1. Let f and g be two polynomials in R½Z.

We can use the same recursions (grammar) as in the partition function algorithm but with the Minkowski sum È instead of multiplication, convex hull of union instead of summation and the corresponding feature vector c instead of e Àhc, hi=RT. Furthermore, because union is invariant with respect to repetition of points, the dynamic programming is allowed to be redundant, or equivalently the grammar is allowed to be ambiguous. Hence, any complete i302</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E.Forouzmand and H.Chitsaz</head><p>RNA structure or RNA–RNA interaction prediction dynamic programming algorithm can be transformed into a Newton polytope algorithm by replacing the energy with the corresponding feature vector, summation with the Minkowski sum È and minimization with the convex hull of union. As explained above, we transform any complete partition function or structure prediction dynamic programming algorithm, for single RNA, RNA–RNA interaction or multiple interacting RNAs, into a Newton polytope algorithm. For the sake of illustration, we explicitly spell below only the case of single RNA with separate A-U, C-G and G-U base pair counting energy model. All the other cases are trivially obtained following the transformations above. In this case, the feature vector cðx, sÞ ¼ ðc 1 ðx, sÞ, c 2 ðx, sÞ, c 3 ðx, sÞÞ is 3D: c 1 ðx, sÞ is the number of A-U, c 2 ðx, sÞ the number of C-G and c 3 ðx, sÞ the number of G-U base pairs in s. Our dynamic programming algorithm starts by computing the Newton polytope for all unit length subsequences, followed by all length two subsequences ,. .. , up to the Newton polytope for the entire sequence x. We denote the Newton polytope of the subsequence n i Á Á Á n j by N ði, jÞ, i.e. N ði, jÞ :¼ N ðn i Á Á Á n j Þ ð 23Þ The following dynamic programming will yield the result N ði, jÞ ¼ conv [ N ði, 'Þ È N ð' þ 1, jÞ, i ' j À 1 ð1, 0, 0Þ È É È N ði þ 1, j À 1Þ if n i n j ¼ AUjUA ð0, 1, 0Þ È É È N ði þ 1, j À 1Þ if n i n j ¼ CGjGC ð0, 0, 1Þ È É È N ði þ 1, j À 1Þ if n i n j ¼ GUjUGwith the base case N ði, iÞ ¼ ð0, 0, 0Þ È É . To compare with only (AU, CG) base pair counting, we also compute the 2D Newton polygon by just projecting the 3D polytope onto the first two coordinates. There are two different approaches for polytope representation: (i) vertex representation, which is a set of points, and (ii) half plane representation, which is a set of linear inequalities. The former is often called V-representation and the latter H-representation. Although they are equivalent, and there are algorithms to transform one into the other, computing Minkowski sum is more convenient with the V-representation, and convex hull of union works more efficiently with the H-representation. The choice of representation and algorithms will affect the running time. In this article, we use the V-representation. Owing to the complexity of the convex hull problem, the worst case complexity of our algorithm is exponential in the number of features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Verification of the necessary condition</head><p>On computation of N ðxÞ and cðx, yÞ, the feature vector of the experimentally determined structure, it remains to verify whether cðx, yÞ 2 @N ðxÞ. Often, N ðxÞ is represented by its vertices (V-representation) or its confining half planes (H-representation), two equivalent representations that can be transformed into one another. In an H-representation, cðx, yÞ is on the boundary of N ðxÞ iff there is at least one confining plane on which cðx, yÞ lies. This is true because cðx, yÞ 2 N ðxÞ anyways. Therefore, the necessary condition can be easily checked by checking membership of cðx, yÞ in every confining plane. Because the vertices of N ðxÞ are on the integer lattice, all calculations are rational and hence can be performed exactly.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6">Implementation</head><p>We implemented the dynamic programming in equation (24) using MATLAB convex hull function, which is based on the quickhull algorithm (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Barber et al., 1996</ref>). As mentioned above, we used the V-representation and computed the Minkowski sum by direct pairwise summation of vertices. More precisely, for two convex polytopes P with vertices p 1 ,. .. , p a and Q with vertices q 1 ,. .. , q b , the vertices of P È Q are p i þ q j for 1 i a and 1 j b. To verify thepolytope, we calculated the distance of the feature vector from the boundary of the polytope using the 'p_poly_dist' MATLAB function (<ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Yoshpe, 2006</ref>). A zero distance corresponds to the case where the feature vector lies on the boundary, i.e. the condition is satisfied, and a positive distance to the case where the feature vector is in the interior of the Newton polytope. We normalized the distance by third root of the volume of the polytope (square root of the area in the case of a polygon). The normalized distance quantifies how far the feature vector is from the boundary. We parallelized our MATLAB code using MATLAB 'parfor'. The length of input RNA sequences varied between 4 and $120 nt. For the smallest ones, our program took a fraction of a second and for the longest ones it took510 min to run on a 2.5 GHz 12-Core AMD Opteron CPU.</p><formula>N N U U U G G U G G C G A U A G C G A A G A G G U C A C A C C C G U U C C C A U A C C G A A C A C G G A A G U U A A G C U C U U CA G C G C C G A U G G U A G U U G G G G U G U U A G C C C C U G C A A G A G U A G G A C G U U G C C A G G</formula><formula>G G U C U G G G C G C A C U U C G G U G A C G G U A C A G G C C 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 2</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>We introduced the notion of learnability of the parameters of an energy model as a measure of its inherent capability. We derived a necessary condition for the learnability and gave a dynamic programming algorithm to assess it. Our algorithm computes the convex hull of the feature vectors of all feasible structures in the ensemble of a given input sequence. Also, that convex hull coincides with the Newton polytope of the partition function as a polynomial in transformed energy parameters. Our theory applied to a simple energy model that counts A-U, C-G and G-U base pairs separately revealed that about half of chosen known structures could potentially be predicted using this simple energy model. For another one-fifth, the necessary condition is barely violated, which suggests that augmenting this energy model with more features is expected to satisfy the necessary condition for them. The condition is severely violated for 13% of sequences, which will be the subject of future investigation. The twilight zone ($10%) is also interesting and requires deeper examination. The Newton polytope lies in the core of computer algebra for solving polynomial equations. Therefore, we envision applications of our RNA Newton polytope in symbolic estimation ofenergy parameters. Our algorithm has a worst case exponential complexity due to the computation of the convex hull. However, we envision efficient approximation of the Newton ploytope through topology-preserving dimensionality reduction methods. Applying our method to increasingly complex models as well as design of energy models using our analysis method will be pursued in the future. Sufficient conditions for the learnability, and also assessing the generalization power of an energy model, remain for future work. Conflict of Interest: none declared.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>e</head><figDesc>ÀGðx, s, hÞ=RT ð3Þ is the partition function (Chitsaz et al., 2009b; Dirks and Pierce, 2003; McCaskill, 1990) with EðxÞ being the ensemble of possible structures of x.

				<p>Motivation: Spike-in datasets provide a valuable resource for assessing and comparing among competing microarray analysis strategies. Our previous wholly defined spike-in datasets, the Golden and Platinum Spikes, have provided insights for the analysis of Affymetrix GeneChips. However, a similar dataset, in which all cRNA identities and relative levels are known prospectively, has not been available for two-color platforms. Results: We have generated a wholly defined spike-in dataset for Agilent microarrays consisting of 12 arrays with more than 2000 differentially expressed, and approximately 3600 background, cRNAs. The composition of this &apos;Ag Spike&apos; dataset is identical to that of our previous Platinum Spike dataset and therefore allows direct cross-platform comparison. We demonstrate here the utility of the Ag Spike dataset for evaluating different analysis methods designed for two-color arrays. Comparison between the Ag Spike and Platinum Spike studies shows high agreement between results obtained using the Affymetrix and Agilent platforms. Availability: The Ag Spike raw data can be accessed at</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Since their introduction in the mid-1990s (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lockhart et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Schena et al., 1995</ref>), DNA microarrays have become a leading tool in a diverse assortment of research disciplines, including cancer and other disease research, developmental biology and evolutionary biology. The popularity of microarrays owes much to their ability to simultaneously interrogate the expression level of tens of thousands of genes, enabling genome-scale transcriptional profiling of multiple tissues in essentially a single experiment. Although next-generation sequencing approaches such as RNA-Seq provide potentially compelling advantages over microarray-based gene expression profiling—no limitation to known transcripts, no cross-hybridization issues and a broader detection range for expression levels (<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Wang et al., 2009</ref>)—comparisons between these two technologies have indicated that RNA-Seq may have less accurate measurement of absolute RNA expression level (<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Willenbrock et al., 2009</ref>), less sensitive detection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Git et al., 2010</ref>) and a higher error rate for weakly expressed genes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Liu et al., 2011</ref>). For the present, therefore, microarrays remain an important, cost-effective and mature platform for gene expression profiling. The benefit of profiling numerous genes simultaneously by microarrays leads to one of the technique's biggest drawbacks: it is generally not possible to independently verify such a large number of individual data points, making it difficult to assess the accuracy of the data analysis. This is of particular concern due to the tremendous number of microarray data analysis methods, which have proliferated in tandem with the increased use of the arrays themselves. Most previous studies of microarray performance, including the microarray quality control (MAQC) project, used RNA samples in which the identities of most of the individual RNA transcripts were not known (Affymetrix Latin square data, www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/sample_data/datasets.affx;<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Irizarry et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kerr, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">McCall and Irizarry, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Patterson et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Zahurak et al., 2007</ref>). Such an experimental design limits the evaluation of accuracy to only a small number of spike-in cRNAs present in the sample. We previously generated two wholly defined control datasets for the Affymetrix GeneChip platform, the Golden Spike and Platinum Spike datasets (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Choe et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zhu et al., 2010</ref>). In these 'spike in' experiments, the identities and relative concentrations of the complete complement of present cRNAs are known. Over 1300 cRNAs are differentially expressed with designated fold changes ranging from 1.2 to 4, and over 2500 cRNAs serve as background with constant expression levels. We and others have used these datasets to determine optimal methods for analysis of Affymetrix microarrays under various experimental conditions (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Chen et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Choe et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hochreiter et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Pearson, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schuster et al., 2007a, b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Turro et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zhu et al., 2010</ref>). Unfortunately, similar wholly defined spike-in datasets do not exist for other popular microarray platforms, in particular for dual-channel platforms. Different from Affymetrix's single-channel design, for dual-channel microarrays the two samples to be compared are labeled separately with different fluorescent dyes<ref type="bibr">[</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Agilent microarray spike-in dataset</head><p>then hybridized simultaneously to the same array, allowing for direct comparison of differential expression. These differences in array technology require differences in data analysis. For instance, Affymetrix arrays typically call for interpreting both perfect match (PM) and mismatch (MM) probe values and combining the separate probe pairs into a probe set level expression summary (although some Affymetrix platforms, such as whole-transcript expression arrays, use only PM probes). Two-color arrays, on the other hand, require normalizing between fluorophore channels, correcting for possible differential incorporation of the fluorescent dyes, and comparing intensity ratios rather than absolute intensities to detect DEGs (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Churchill, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Duggan et al., 1999</ref>). In order to facilitate evaluation of the various analysis methods required for dual-channel arrays, we generated a fully controlled spike-in dataset for one such platform, Agilent. We refer to this dataset as the 'Ag Spike' experiment due to its use of the Agilent platform and to denote its relationship to the Golden (Au) and Platinum (Pt) Spike studies. The Ag Spike dataset has a cRNA composition identical to that in our previous Platinum Spike dataset and consists of 12 arrays including technical replicates and dye swapped arrays. To illustrate the utility of the Ag Spike dataset, we evaluated 26 analysis routes, derived from combining several methods in individual steps of the analysis procedure, for their performance in detecting DEGs. In addition, we compared the results from this dataset and the Affymetrix-based Platinum Spike dataset and found high concordance across platforms. The Ag Spike dataset comprises a useful resource for further studies of optimal analysis methods for dual-channel microarrays.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">cRNA sample preparation and hybridization</head><p>We used the same 28 PCR pools that had been used before to generate the Platinum Spike dataset. These pools contain PCR products from 5725 Drosophila Gene Collection release 1.0 (DGCr1) cDNA clones. We mixed PCR products from all pools together with specified relative abundance to generate two samples representing the A and B conditions. Both samples were in vitro transcribed and then labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescent dye. Labeled A samples were hybridized with B samples labeled with reverse dye to three Agilent Drosophila Gene Expression microarrays. The process from in vitro transcription to hybridization was repeated twice (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>). Note that because samples were mixed as a pool, cRNAs from the same pool have identical fold change values between conditions (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). At the end, we generated 12 arrays that were randomly placed in three independent slides to remove potential systematic error due to array position (Supplementary Material).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Probe fold change assignment</head><p>We first identified the probes hybridized to cRNAs present in samples by aligning the sequences of all probes to the obtained clone sequences. Alignment was done using BLAST (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Altschul et al., 1990</ref>) (version 2.2.18) with word size seven, no complexity filter and e-value cutoff 1. In order to assign a probe to a specific clone, we required no fewer than 40% of the probe sequence matched identically to the clone sequence on the correct strand with no gaps (Supplementary Material). Probes assigned to multiple clones or to clones with multiple fold change values were excluded from our analysis. Therefore, using relatively low sequence identity cutoff in clone assignment step allowed us to remove potential cross-hybridization. For each probe uniquely assigned to a clone, the fold change value of the corresponding clone was assigned to the probe. If this clone had multiple</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Q.Zhu et al.</head><p>potential sequences, we required that no fewer than 90% of the potential sequences mapped to the probe in order to assign the fold change value to the particular probe (Supplementary Material).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">DEG detection</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">Preprocessing</head><p>Background correction was either skipped or performed using one of the two different methods: normexp and rma. Within-array normalization was either not performed or performed with loess normalization. Later on between-array normalization step was skipped or performed using quantile normalization. We have previously found that normalization among all arrays performed the best when up-and downregulation was balanced between the two compared conditions (<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zhu et al., 2010</ref>). Therefore all 12 arrays in Ag Spike dataset were normalized together during the between-array normalization step. These preprocessing methods were from the LIMMA Bioconductor library (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ritchie et al., 2007</ref>; Smyth and<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Speed, 2003</ref>). We also performed preprocessing using only Agilent's Feature Extraction software (FE; version 9.5.3.1), followed by testing for DEGs as described below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">DEG tests</head><p>Two different methods were used for prediction of DEGs: fold change (simply calculating log 2 fold change between the A and B conditions) or LIMMA (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Smyth, 2004</ref>). In this step, we treated technical replicates as biological replicates, because the variation introduced by independent sample preparation was much smaller than the variation introduced by hybridization (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. S1</ref>). We did note that the probe intensities from one array (Aare higher than those of the other arrays, including its own corresponding technical replicates (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. S2</ref>). This suggests that a technical error occurred in the handling of this array. However, the preprocessing procedures, including background correction and normalization, were able to bring this array comparable with other arrays [Pearson's correlation coefficient between this array and its technical replicates improves from 0.420 and 0.530 to 0.842 and 0.845 (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. S3</ref>), and the median correlation between this array and its biological replicates is 0.758 after preprocessing], and the best performance for DEG detection using all 12 arrays was found to be slightly better than when excluding the particular array (data not shown). Therefore, our analysis included all 12 arrays in the Ag Spike dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Receiver operating characteristic curves</head><p>For routes using fold change to detect DEGs, the absolute values of log 2 fold change were given to the ROCR library (<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Sing et al., 2005</ref>) to generate the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calculate the area under the curve (AUC) values. For routes using LIMMA, the AUC values were calculated based on the absolute values of the corresponding test statistics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Variance component analysis</head><p>We fitted the raw foreground intensities corresponding to a given probe across all arrays from the same condition with a mixed effect model: log 2 (Y ijk ) = µ+α i +B j +ε ijk , where i refers to different dye, j refers to independent sample preparation, k refers to individual array; i = 1,2,j = 1,2 and k = 1,2,3. The model was fit separately on the arrays from each condition. Y ijk was the raw foreground probe intensity. α 1 and α 2 corresponded to the effect of different fluorescent dye. B j , which is assumed to follow a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance</p><formula>σ 2 B (B j ∼ N(0,σ 2 B )</formula><p>), represented the effect of independent in vitro transcription and labeling. ε ijk ∼ N(0,σ 2 ) represented the residual error within technical replicates. We refer to the two variance components σ 2 B and σ 2 as biological variance and technical variance for convenience, which estimate the variation introduced by sample preparation and array hybridization, respectively. The mixed effect model was fit using the lmer function from the lme4 library (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bates et al., 2008</ref>), and the restricted maximum likelihood estimators of the variance components were obtained.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Computation</head><p>All computation was performed using RedHat Enterprise Linux 4, 2.6 Kernel, R version 2.7.2 (R Development Core<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Team, 2008</ref>), and Bioconductor version 2.2 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gentleman et al., 2004</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RESULTS</head><p>The Ag Spike dataset involves two groups of six arrays each from two independent sample preparations. The six arrays within each group contain three technical replicates and their corresponding dyeswapped pairs. Each array was hybridized with samples from two different conditions ('A' and 'B') (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>). The cRNA composition under each condition is identical to that in our previous Platinum Spike dataset except that the 26 cRNAs spiked with known absolute concentration in the Platinum Spike dataset were excluded here (<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zhu et al., 2010</ref>). The Ag Spike dataset contains 1134 and 935 cRNAs up-and down-regulated, respectively, in condition A compared with B, with fold change values varying between 1.2× and 4×. The relative concentrations of another 3643 RNAs were kept unchanged between the two conditions. Similar to the Platinum Spike dataset, the Ag Spike dataset is balanced with respect to total labeled RNA amount and extent of up-and down-regulation for each experimental condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Detection of DEGs</head><p>To identify DEGs between the two compared conditions, 26 different routes were used to process the raw probe intensities in the Ag Spike dataset. These routes used different methods for background correction and normalization and used different test statistics for detecting DEGs. The performance of all routes was evaluated with r AUC 0.05 (0 ≤ r AUC 0.05 ≤ 1, larger values = better performance), which measures the AUC value relative to the maximum (0.05) when the false positive rate (1−specificity) is ≤ 0.05 (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table S1</ref>). Most routes give reasonable performance [median r AUC 0.05 = 0.794, median TPR 0.05 (true positive rate when<ref type="bibr">873]</ref>. The best route for DEG detection in the Ag Spike dataset used normexp background correction, loess within-array normalization, and no between-array normalization and LIMMA for DEG testing ( r AUC 0.05 = 0.823, TPR 0.05 = 0.890). The performance of this route is comparable with the 97.8 percentile of routes evaluated in the Platinum Spike dataset based on r AUC 0.05. In the background correction step, we found routes using normexp method perform consistently better than routes using other methods, while routes using the rma background method perform worse than most routes. Similarly, using loess within-array normalization leads to better performance than skipping within-array normalization (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figs 2 and 3</ref>). However, at the step of between-array normalization and DEG testing, no superior method is found as those corresponding to better average performance also result in large variation of performance (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>and Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. S4</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Agilent microarray spike-in dataset</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Comparison with the Affymetrix dataset</head><p>Consistency across platforms has been a concern for microarray utilization (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Li et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Tan et al., 2003</ref>). In previous efforts to Page: 1288 1284–1289address this issue, arrays from different platforms were hybridized with identical samples but with little information about the constituent RNAs (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Irizarry et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Järvinen et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Patterson et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Tan et al., 2003</ref>). The identical cRNA composition between the Ag Spike dataset and our previous Platinum Spike dataset allowed us to assess the consistency of the results from the two different platforms. We found that the overall performance of DEG detection is quite close between the best route from the Ag Spike dataset (normexp background correction, loess within-array normalization, no between-array normalization and LIMMA for DEG detection) and the best route from the Platinum Spike dataset (gcrma-reb background correction, scaling probe normalization among all arrays, using only PM probe intensities for medianpolish summarization, vsn probe set normalization among technical replicates and using CyberT for DEG detection) ( r AUC 0.05 = 0.823 and 0.848, respectively). With false positive rate ≤ 0.05, 89% of the probes assigned to clones with distinct amounts in the two conditions are correctly detected as differentially expressed in the Ag Spike dataset, comparable with the top TPR 0.05 of 88% in the Platinum Spike dataset. We then focused on the 4935 clones that have assigned probes/probesets in both platforms and compared the concordance between test statistics from the two platforms using the best route from each. We found the test statistic values from the two platforms agree well with each other (Kendall's concordance coefficient W = 0.853,<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4A</ref>). We also observed high concordance when comparing the log 2 (fold change) between conditions A and B of the two routes (Kendall's concordance coefficient W = 0.854,<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4B</ref>). These results suggest that high concordance between the two platforms can be achieved when hybridization and data analysis are properly performed, consistent with results from the MAQC study (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Patterson et al., 2006</ref>).</p></div>

			<note place="foot" n="4"> DISCUSSION We have generated the first wholly defined control dataset for the Agilent platform including over 2000 DEGs and 3600 non-DEGs. Using this control dataset, we compared a total of 26 analysis routes for detecting DEGs as a first-pass evaluation of the many existing analysis methods for dual-channel microarrays. The preprocessing steps of normexp background correction and loess within-array normalization performed better than other compared methods and were able to correct for technical errors that had resulted in overall higher intensities in a single array. We found that the results from the Ag Spike dataset were highly consistent with results from the Platinum Spike dataset, whose cRNA composition is identical to the current dataset but which was performed using the Affymetrix platform, when best routes from each analysis were compared. The Ag Spike dataset should prove a valuable community resource for further evaluation of the Agilent platform and for analysis of dual-channel microarrays in general.</note>

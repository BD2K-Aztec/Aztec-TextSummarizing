				<p>Motivation: What if you could explain complex chemistry in a simple tree and share that data online with your collaborators? Computational biology often incorporates diverse chemical data to probe a biological question, but the existing tools for chemical data are ill-suited for the very large datasets inherent to bioinformatics. Furthermore, existing visualization methods often require an expert chemist to interpret the patterns. Biologists need an interactive tool for visualizing chemical information in an intuitive, accessible way that facilitates its integration into today&apos;s team-based biological research. Results: ChemTreeMap is an interactive, bioinformatics tool designed to explore chemical space and mine the relationships between chemical structure, molecular properties, and biological activity. ChemTreeMap synergistically combines extended connectivity fingerprints and a neighbor-joining algorithm to produce a hierarchical tree with branch lengths proportional to molecular similarity. Compound properties are shown by leaf color, size, and outline to yield a user-defined visualization of the tree. Two representative analyses are included to demonstrate ChemTreeMap&apos;s capabilities and utility: assessing dataset overlap and mining structure-activity relationships (SAR). Availability: The examples from this paper may be accessed at http://ajing.github.io/ChemTreeMap/. Code for the server and client are available in the Supplementary Information, at the aforementioned github site, and on Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com) with the nametag ajing/chemtreemap.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Researchers in the field of bioinformatics are frequently tasked with exploring the relationship between chemical structures and their potential biological actions. For example, one can predict the interaction between a small molecule and a corresponding protein target, given the chemical structure (<ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Yamanishi et al., 2010</ref>). The degree of similarity between chemical structures can also indicate a potential for drug repositioning (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Liu et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Huang et al., 2015</ref>) or off-target effects (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Gohlke et al., 2015</ref>). A molecules' ability to inhibit protein-protein interactions may also be predicted (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kuenemann et al., 2015</ref>). In order to discover such interactions, researchers must harness large databases, including PubChem (<ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Wang et al., 2012</ref>) and ChEMBL (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gaulton et al., 2012</ref>), which contain vast amounts of heterogeneous biological and chemical data. The size and complexity of these datasets necessitate automated tools to explore available chemical space in order to determine chemical relationships and predict potential interactions. Exploring chemical space frequently requires a comparison of the number of shared chemicals among multiple databases (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Huang et al., 2015</ref>), an understanding of the similarity within a compound series (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Huang et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Gohlke et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Liu et al., 2014</ref>)series, and an analysis of how compound structures give rise to a specific biological action (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kuenemann et al., 2015</ref>). Such analysis begins with the visualization of molecular datasets. There are general visualization strategies such as Venn diagrams (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Huang et al., 2015</ref>), networks (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Huang et al., 2015</ref>), heat maps (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Gohlke et al., 2015</ref>), and clusters (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Liu et al., 2014</ref>). However, those strategies have limited utility, depending on the biological question and how detailed the analysis must be.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>J.Lu and H.A.Carlson</head><p>Graphical tools have been developed for cheminformatics that group structurally similar molecules together and display information about molecular structure and bioactivity (<ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Schuffenhauer et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Wetzel et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Wawer and Bajorath, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Wollenhaupt and Baumann, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Sander et al., 2015</ref>). The previous methods usually require users to choose selection rules (<ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Wawer and Bajorath, 2010</ref>) and tune parameters (<ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Wollenhaupt and Baumann, 2014</ref>). This can limit the utility of these tools for large, diverse sets of data that are the hallmark of bioinformatics. Those tools can also require domain experts to effectively use them, which limits their extension to a larger user base. To overcome these limitations, we have developed ChemTreeMap, an open-source tool for visualizing compound similarity coupled with associated biochemical information. We have carefully selected techniques for calculating molecular similarity and representing chemical space to satisfy the needs of bioinformaticians. The tool uses standard procedures, requires no tuning parameters, and allows users to interactively explore a molecular dataset. ChemTreeMap organizes molecules into a hierarchical tree based on chemical similarity, much like phylogenetic trees that are commonly used in biology. This provides a familiar framework for scientists to view and access desired information. Users can map any property of interest to the graph's leaf attributes (i.e. color, size, and border color). This facilitates an on-the-fly, customized exploration of the relationships between molecular structure and other properties. ChemTreeMap's organization reflects the similarities of molecules at various levels and in different chemical series. It does not rely on any assumption about the similarity cutoff. Users can explore the branches to understand the similarity across the nearby molecules. The branch lengths quantify the difference in features, which is particularly useful for a structurally diverse datasets. Longer distances between chemical families highlight more diverse regions of chemical space. To illustrate ChemTreeMap's utility, we describe two practical applications: the visualization of chemical overlap between molecular datasets and the extraction of structure-activity relationships (SAR).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methods</head><p>Organization and visualization of a molecular library requires three considerations: first, how to represent a molecule, second, how to quantify the similarities between different molecules, and lastly, how to represent these similarities graphically. Each ChemTreeMap is then completed by coloring the resulting tree to convey biochemical information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Representation of the molecules</head><p>Our primary molecular descriptors are stereochemistry-aware, extended connectivity fingerprints (ECFP6#S). These are topological descriptions that capture large, recursive, circular neighborhoods around each atom. This method identifies the functional groups in each molecule, and it is quick to calculate, which makes it well suited for large molecular datasets (<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Rogers and Hahn, 2010</ref>). ChemTreeMap also calculates atompairs fingerprints (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Carhart et al., 1985</ref>) as an alternative metric. Others can be added easily, such as MACCS keys (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Durant et al., 2002</ref>), topological torsion fingerprints (<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Nilakantan et al., 1987</ref>), and 2Dpharmacophore fingerprints (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gobbi and Poppinger, 1998</ref>). A potential concern about fingerprints is that their pair-wise comparisons may not be optimal for a global description of the data (<ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Wollenhaupt and Baumann, 2014</ref>). Fortunately, ChemTreeMap's display uses a global, hierarchical organization to convey information at the local level and in the overall patterns across the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Construction of the chemical similarity tree</head><p>The similarity of two molecules is calculated by a Tanimoto coefficient (Tc) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Levandowsky and Winter, 1971</ref>), which refers to the number of chemical features they share in common divided by the union of all features (a % similarity with values from 0 to 1). Tc was chosen because of it is fast, easy to implement, and widely used in chem-informatics and drug-discovery software. Branch lengths in ChemTreeMap are inversely proportional to the Tc between the molecules, where shorter branches show high similarity and longer indicate greater diversity. To build the hierarchical tree, we chose the Neighbor-Joining algorithm (NJ, see Supplementary Information) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Saitou and Nei, 1987</ref>). The NJ algorithm is widely used in building phylogenetic trees for large and diverse sequences (<ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Vinh and von Haeseler, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Tamura et al., 2004</ref>). It has been mathematically proven that given a correct input distance matrix, the output tree and branch lengths from NJ will also be correct (<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mihaescu et al., 2007</ref>). Furthermore, NJ does not rely on any parameter tuning, making the tree construction more robust. RapidNJ has a bestcase running time of<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Simonsen et al., 2008</ref>). It is an agglomerative joining method that follows: 1. D is an N × N distance matrix, where each element Dij = Tc(i,j) and (i, j represent two molecules from the set of N molecules)</p><p>2. The average distance from molecule i to all other molecules k is:5. For that i, j pair, an imaginary ancestor node is created to replace i and j. The distance between and i, j is:6. D is then updated by replacing i and j with an ancestral node. The distances between and all the other nodes k are:</p><formula>vi</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Clustering of Molecules for Very Large Datasets</head><p>For huge datasets, such as ChEMBL (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gaulton et al., 2012</ref>), BindingDB (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Liu et al., 2007</ref>), and ChemBank (<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Seiler et al., 2008</ref>), the molecules need to be clustered by similarity to reduce the size of the task. An interactive display of millions of leafs is not possible with current technology. For tractability, ChEMBL and ChemBank were each independently sorted into their own 4000 clusters. Because BindingDB is smaller, its molecules were clustered into 2000 sets. All clusters were represented by the molecule with the highest sum of Tc across the subset, the molecule most similar to all the others in the group. The size of the leaf for that center is proportional to the number of molecules in the group. It would be possible to produce a ChemTreeMap for each cluster, but wading through thousands of smaller trees is not practical.fingerprint, the clustering step for ChEMBL – the largest dataset – took less than 5 hours to run on a machine with 16G memory (i3-2100 CPU @ 3.10GHz). In comparison, the maximum dissimilarity method (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hassan et al., 1996</ref>) implemented in PipelinePilot (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hassan et al., 2006</ref>) takes more than a week to cluster ChEMBL, and an algorithm with average runtime complexity</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Implementation</head><p>The application has a client-server paradigm (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Benatallah et al., 2004</ref>), in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 1</ref>, which allows online access to the results and facilitates sharing data with colleagues. The server performs tree construction, including fingerprint calculations, similarity calculations, neighbor joining, layout optimization, pIC50, ligand efficiency (LE = 1.37×pIC50/heavy-atoms, for rough conversion to ∆Gbind/HA), and SlogP calculations (<ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Wildman and Crippen, 1999</ref>). All output from the server processes are packaged into a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file for client input. The client process displays the tree structures and supports functions, such as searching by ID and changing leaf attributes: circle size, colored border, and biochemical metric mapped to the circle. Layout optimization uses a multiscale version of dynamic, spring-model layouts implemented in GraphViz (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Ellson et al., 2001</ref>). This allows users to actively pull and reorient nodes/branches to improve the visual layout in a local area. ChemTreeMap is a web-based tool, which is easy to set up on any computer with Python 2.7. GraphViz and RapidNJ are freely available online for major operating systems (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Ellson et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Simonsen et al., 2008</ref>). The graphics can be viewed on any computer with an HTML5 capable browser (tested on Google Chrome Version 46, Internet Explorer 11, and Safari 9.0). We recommend Google Chrome for displaying ChemTreeMaps of thousands of molecules because of the computational intensity of its force-directed graph. Speed also depends on client hardware.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">ChemTreeMap can be easily extended with more features</head><p>A straightforward option to add functionality is to input additional data for each molecule, as columns in a tab-delineated input file (e.g. SMILE string, data 1, data 2, etc.). The program will present the additional data as options in drop-down menus for the user to map that information onto the ChemTreeMap leafs through display options (color, border, size). A more powerful alternative is to extend the functionality in ChemTreeMap's TreeBuild.py file. Currently, the chemical properties of LE and SlogP are calculated using RDKit in TreeBuild.py, and developers can very easily add 55 additional descriptors from RDKit. For more descriptors, we recommend adding data from MOE (Chemical Computing Group Inc., 2014) or PaDEL (<ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Yap, 2011)</ref>with the simple tabdelimited option. Any in-house, custom analysis is best added directly in the python code if it will be used frequently.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Comparing ChemTreeMap to other SAR methods</head><p>We compared ChemTreeMap with four freely available programs: Similarity-Potency Tree (SPT,<ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Wawer and Bajorath, 2010</ref>), Data Warrior (<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Sander et al., 2015</ref>), Scaffold Hunter (<ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Wetzel et al., 2009</ref>), and CheS</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Datasets</head><p>ChemTreeMap is applicable to a wide range of datasets with various levels of complexity and sizes. To demonstrate ChemTreeMap, we have chosen diverse biomolecular datasets ranging from thousands to millions of molecules. To show chem-data overlap, we use some of the largest datasets with bioactivity data: ChEMBL v. 20 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gaulton et al., 2012</ref>), BindingDB (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Liu et al., 2007</ref>), and ChemBank (<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Seiler et al., 2008</ref>). For SAR examples, we assembled chemical datasets for the four protein targets shown in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. Clotting factor Xa (FXa), cyclin-dependant kinase 2 (CDK2), p38α MAP kinase (p38α), and cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) were chosen because their SAR are well characterized (<ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Sutherland et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fontaine et al., 2005</ref>), and they have been used in previous studies for visualizing chemical data (<ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Wawer and Bajorath, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Wollenhaupt and Baumann, 2014</ref>). The data for FXa, CDK2, and p38α are from BindingDB. CYP3A4 data (bioassay AID:884) was pulled from high-throughput screening (HTS) data in PubChem (<ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Wang et al., 2012</ref>). All four systems have a large range of inhibition data. The average Tc for each set is under 0.2, which indicates high chemical diversity. Each of the SAR datasets was prepared using the following protocol:</p><p>1. For inclusion, a molecule must have an IC50 or pIC50 for bioactivity. For PubChem data, only molecules in the " Active " category were kept for analysis.</p><p>2. If there were multiple activity data for a molecule, the average of the IC50 was used (i.e. no repeat chemical structures).</p><p>3. The ionization state and tautomers for each chemical structure were determined using the " wash " utility in MOE 2014 (Chemical Computing Group Inc., 2014).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Results and Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Comparing chemical diversity of large datasets</head><p>When more data is needed for a project, information that covers new chemical space is typically preferred. Depending on the project, very wide diversity may be desirable to enhance breadth, or new compounds in nearby chemical space may be needed to increase the depth of coverage. ChemTreeMap can identify both types of chemical similarity/diversity. Existing methods count the number of duplicate molecules between the sets (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Huang et al., 2015</ref>), or they map chemical features to a 2D scatter plot with overlapping regions, based on principal component analysis or multidimensional scaling (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Awale et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lewis et al., 2015</ref>). These methods can fail to convey enough information on the structural similarity within/between the molecular sets. Our examples for comparing large sets revolve around ChEMBL (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gaulton et al., 2012</ref>). It is a dataset with ~1.3 million chemicals with significant biochemical annotation from the literature (~50 journals). We compared ChEMBL to ChemBank and BindingDB to show datasets that represent collections with more breadth vs more depth, respectively. ChemBank (<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Seiler et al., 2008</ref>) is a set of ~1.15 million molecules constructed from chemical HTS studies. Many compounds in ChEMBL are not from HTS studies and will not appear in ChemBank. Though many HTS studies eventually appear in the literature, the full data for every compound rarely appears in a final publication. Therefore, we knew that many molecules would appear in one but not the other. We did not know how similar/different the chemical sets were from one another, but we expected significant populations of ChEMBL-only and ChemBank-only compounds with many in similar chemical space. The traditional Venn diagram in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 2</ref>shows that the overlap is relatively small as expected; 11.3% of ChEMBL molecules are the same as 12.8% of ChemBank's compounds. To show the chemical similarity and diversity, a more detailed display is needed. ChemTreeMap highlights regions where the chemical space is unique to ChemBank (red branches A and B) and to ChEMBL (blue branch C). Though some branches contain red and blue leafs in similar chemical space, combining the two sets primarily increases the breath of chemistry structures overall. ChEMBL (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gaulton et al., 2012</ref>) and BindingDB (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Liu et al., 2007</ref>) both curate molecules from the biochemical literature. BindingDB focuses on protein targets with crystal structures in the Protein Data Bank. It enhances the structures with experimental binding data for many ligands. ChEMBL is a major source of data for BindingDB's molecules, but BindingDB includes data from 12 biochemical journals not covered by ChEMBL. Together, ChEMBL and BindingDB's shared efforts provide ~60 journals-worth of data to the scientific community. Based on their construction, a large overlap is expected for ChEMBL +BindingDB (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 3</ref>). About 82% of the molecules in BindingDB are also in ChEMBL (black nodes). No large branches are dominated by BindingDB. Instead, many of ChEMBL's branches contain new molecules from BindingDB.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 3</ref>shows that this augmentation to ChEMBL from BindingDB adds depth of coverage, specific to drug-like space.show the entire data space. Full details can be seen by zooming in on any region.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ChemTreeMap</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Options for displaying more information</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A distinct advantage for ChemTreeMap is the ability to display multiple layers of information simultaneously through leaf color</head><p>, outline, and size. For example, molecules with good solubility and high LE are desirable for drug leads.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 4</ref>shows how ChemTreeMap adds more data through outlines. Molecules with good solubility (low number, red) or good LE (higher number, red) can be easily recognized in the graph. Users could extend ChemTreeMap with more SAR metrics, like SALI scores (Structure-Activity Landscape Index, Guha and Van Drie, 2008) or PAINS alerts (Pan Assay Interference compounds, Baell and Holloway, 2010). ChemTreeMap uses a broad color scheme purple-blue-cyan-greenyellow-red. Previous studies have scaled the colors green-yellow-red to fit the max/min range in each dataset (<ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Wawer and Bajorath, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Wollenhaupt and Baumann, 2014</ref>). Having twice the number of colors allows us to show a larger span of properties with better clarity. It also allows users to easily compare different datasets because the static colors always indicate the same IC50 in any ChemTreeMap. The spectrum basically covers the full range of affinities obtained in biological assays, where inhibitors vary in IC50 from ~100 µM (purple: pIC50 ≥ 4) to ~1 nM (red: pIC50 ≤ 9). For LE, the range is 0 (purple) to 0.5 (red) kcal/molHeavyAtom, which covers 90% enzyme activity data from our previous study (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Carlson et al., 2008</ref>). For SlogP, the range is set from-5 (red) to 5 (purple). Users can switch between attributes while inspecting the branches, and the features are interactive, e.g. navigating, dragging, or zooming to see details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">ChemTreeMap can be used to extract SAR information</head><p>For the rest of our examples, the molecules were not clustered, and all leafs represent a single compound. Traditionally, SAR information is deduced by analyzing molecules from several chemical series, often incorporating predictive statistical models (<ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Wawer and Bajorath, 2010</ref>). Interpretation can be strongly dependent on the experience of the chemists, and these paradigms are limited in the number of compounds one can analyze. ChemTreeMap provides an intuitive, robust, and effective way to extract SAR information from a chemical library. ChemTreeMap does not rely on any assumption about the similarity cutoff. Its hierarchical organization of molecules, based on structural similarity, facilitates the identification of SAR hotspots and activity cliffs. The distance between leafs highlights the (dis)similarity between any molecule pair.ovals). Compounds in these groups have a higher potential for drug development. There are also a small number of one-off, strong inhibitors that are likely HTS error (rare orange and red leafs). The top bar contains drop down menus for ECFP or Atom-Pair fingerprints and the leafs (circle size, circle border, activity metric, settings, and info). The tree is dynamic using a force-directed graph with control of the " Radius of Display " (see Supplementary Information). The color bar shows the activity metric. Each color represents one level of potency (pIC50): which is 4 (purple, IC50 = 100 µM, indigo), 5 (blue), 6 (cyan, IC50 = 1 µM,), 7 (green), 8 (yellow), 9 (IC50 = 1 nM, red).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.1">HTS</head><p>HTS is a screening technology that tests thousands of molecules in a biochemical assay. Hits are typically inhibitors of an enzymatic assay, but many different assays exist that test a variety of effects. ChemTreeMap displays can help with interpreting the data. ChemTreeMap has an advantage when exploring large, heterogeneous datasets from HTS because of its speed, hierarchical structure, and broad color range. Most of the compounds used in HTS are inactive, which can be seen by the predominance of blue/purple in a CYP3A4 ChemTreeMap,<ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 5</ref>. HTS data is notorious for many false positives and false negatives. One of the hallmarks of true positives is finding many similar molecules displaying moderate activity like those marked in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 5</ref>. These regions indicate chemical space with potential for further development. Groupings of hits can be a small, 5-molecule sub-tree or a large branch of 30+ compounds. Of course, proper statistics are critical to assessing signalto-noise in HTS data. One way that ChemTreeMap could be easily extended for a custom HTS application is to map statistical significance of each compound's signal onto their leaf outlines (e.g. z-score).<ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 6</ref>is the ChemTreeMap of our SAR set for FXa. A typical SAR set explores a more focused area of chemical space (inhibitors in this example). The molecules have a range of activities that change with the structural features.

An " activity cliff " is easy to identify for compounds J and K. Activity cliffs occur when a small chemical modification leads to a large change in activity (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bajorath, 2014</ref>). ChemTreeMap makes it easy to find molecules in very close proximity with large color changes. Several other structural features are also seen in the full dataset, such as activity switches and SAR hotspots also identified using inSARa (<ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Wollenhaupt and Baumann, 2014</ref>), but for brevity, we focus on region I. Molecules A-H/J/K differ by small chemical changes on the central ring. Molecule I differs from H by a methyl group in place of a chlorine at the bottom of the molecule. I is a " descendent " of H because they are most similar, but I is one step away from the common structure of the other compounds. The addition of a four-membered ring in L is a large chemical change that places it in a nearby sub-tree separate from A-K.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. 8</ref>provides the analyses of the FXa dataset with SPT, Data Warrior, and Scaffold Hunter. Here, we focus the discussion on compounds from sub-tree I. SPT is the state-of-the-art method for cheminformatics. An accurate method should show agreement with SPT and improvement where possible.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. 8(a)</ref>shows that the same molecules from sub-tree I gave a large structural feature in the highest-ranked tree found with SPT, which is in good agreement with our finding that sub-tree I is the largestshown. The common core is marked in gray, and the differences in the functional groups are noted with red circles. The functional group circled in purple is an essential feature for these FXa inhibitors, and L is a representative of a nearby sub-tree that modifies this part of the molecule.contiguous region of high activity. The majority of compounds in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig.  8</ref>(a) are from the two marked regions in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 6</ref>. SPT constructs a different visual tree that uses the compounds as nodes. All molecules with Tc &gt;0.4 of the root compound are organized into levels. Each level shows all molecules with Tc &gt;0.55 to the root-molecule above it. SPT organizes each level by increasing activity from left to right, but removes the structural relationships between molecules in the same level. The ordering directs the user toward the most active compounds, but it may obscure structural features of the SAR. For instance, H/J/K only differ by the location of one chlorine atom, yet they appear unrelated in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. 8</ref>(a). In<ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. 8</ref>(b), Data Warrior spreads A-L across its entire network, with few connections between them. Several of the molecules are shown as lone data points. In<ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. 8</ref>(c), Scaffold Hunter correctly identifies the common substructure of A-K, but molecule L is placed in another tree with cyclobutane as a root. The relationship between A-K and L is lost. The impact of small modifications on activity is not presented, but the information is necessary for SAR studies. In<ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. 8</ref>(d), CheS-Mapper gives relationships similar to ours. D-G are close together and H-L have the same pattern, but C is grouped with A+B in CheS-Mapper not with D-G like ChemTreeMap. Either combination is reasonable. For the full dataset, CheS-Mapper was overcrowded, and some SAR was obscured. Clearly, future enhancements for ChemTreeMap should include scaffold information like Scaffold Hunter. The ancestor nodes that serve as branch points are prime locations for showing the shared common substructure of the descendent molecules. It would also be an appropriate point in the graph to display SAR alerts based on the patterns of activity in the descendent branches. Though not seen in the data for<ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig 8(d)</ref>, CheS-Mapper has alerts for activity cliffs, and similar alerts should be incorporated into ChemTreeMap.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.3">SAR hotspot in CDK2 data</head><p>An SAR hotspot is a collection of similar molecules displaying a wide range of potency. Finding these series are important for SAR, but they can also facilitate " patent busting. " ChemTreeMap makes finding SAR hotspots easier by having 1) a wide color range for activity and 2) branch lengths between nodes that are proportional to chemical similarity. Short branches with many colors are candidates for SAR hotspots. In<ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Fig. 9</ref>(a), the ChemTreeMap for CDK2 contains sub-tree II, an SAR hotspot. In<ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Fig. 9</ref>(b), two sets of molecules can be seen in different branches because of their chemical similarity: A/B (ether substitutions) and C-E (alkane substitutions). These are separate from F-H which have larger chemical differences between each other and the rest of sub-tree II. If these molecules were ordered by potency, these groupings would be more difficult to identify. However, the preference for a branched, 4atom substituent would still be clear. In<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig 10(</ref>a), SPT identifies sub-tree II compounds in its secondranked tree. The rank of the tree is fitting because some compounds have low activity. The chemical similarity is clear in the SPT tree, but SPT's color scheme is a limitation. The colors are scaled to span the min to max values across the whole dataset. ChemTreeMap's color scale makes it easy to identify the drop in activity for compounds B and F. Data warrior in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig 10(b)</ref>captures the similarity of the ethers in A and B, but they are far from the rest of the compounds. Also, C-E are not necessarily distinct from F-H. Scaffold Hunter in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig 10(c)</ref>shows that all molecules of sub-tree II share the same scaffold, but the SAR between them is not shown.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig 10(d)</ref>shows CheS-Mapper is similar to ChemTreeMap, except C is more " central " and H is too far from A-G.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>ChemTreeMap is innovative for quantifying chemical similarity in the branch lengths as done for phylogenetic trees, organizing molecules in an alternative hierarchy, and mapping multiple properties to graphical attributes. It uses robust, widely accepted methods. ChemTreeMap is designed as a general purpose chemical visualization and data mining tool with many interactive features to ease the navigation in large datasets (dragging, zooming, searching, etc). A single click on a leaf yields detailed molecular information. Its dynamic layout allows users to modify the tree, using a click-and-drag feature on the nodes that can reposition branches to improve the view. ChemTreeMap is applicable to a wide range of problems. Any data can be mapped onto the similarity tree. The approach does not make any assumptions about the relationship between activity and structure, thus enabling a data-driven interpretation of biochemical information. It can also be also implemented in a client-server format that allows efficient data sharing between collaborators.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><figDesc>O(N 2 ) and at worst O(N 3 ) (</figDesc></figure>

			<note place="foot">Mapper (Gütlein et al., 2012, 2014). SPT is the method most similar to ChemTreeMap. It uses Tc with ECFP4#S fingerprints to calculate chemical similarity, but it uses a different type of tree display and network analysis. SPT has a compound-centric view, focusing on potency and a limited set of nearest neighbors in chemical space. Their tree structures rely on a chosen reference compound. Similar molecules are not necessarily grouped together in some cases. Data Warrior is an open-source program with highly interactive graphical views and interesting statistical analysis. It focuses on similar neighborhood relations only and ignores similarity relations below a certain threshold. Such methods may not capture enough structural breadth for a diversified dataset. Scaffold Hunter identifies chemical cores for each molecule and associates them in a hierarchy based on medicinal chemistry rules. A treelike output is used, but the local SAR of individual molecules sharing the same scaffold is not displayed. CheS-Mapper focuses on analysis of QSAR models and extendibility to other applications is not clear. It uses chemical clustering and dimensionality reduction to organize compounds into a virtual 3D space. The space is defined by physicochemical descriptors of chemical/biological similarity that are chosen by the user. Unfortunately, the compression of multiple descriptors into three dimensions inherently produces a loss of information (the same likely applies to ChemTreeMap). More importantly, many of the descriptors are not well known in the bioinformatics community. This tool is best for a chemist who knows how to choose the best options. Fortunately, statistical analysis is provided to interpret the degree of lost data, so the non-expert is at least warned of poor choices. We did not have access to a maximum common substructure (MCS) method for comparison. MCS is another way to organize molecules into groups, based on pre-defined chemical functionalities and novel pattern matching (Gardiner et al., 2007). Like Scaffold Hunter, MCS techniques identify common core patterns across a dataset. InSARa is a recently introduced MCS method (Wollenhaupt and Baumann, 2014) that uses reduced graphs to create tree-based output like ChemTreeMap, SPT, and Scaffold Hunter. Its final representative substructures are sensitive to many parameter choices (Wollenhaupt and Baumann, 2014), which is where ChemTreeMap and inSARa differ. Our generalized Tc-based distances have no tunable parameters, other than the choice of fingerprints. A tunable method has its own benefits, and we see inSARa as a complementary method to ChemTreeMap, SPT, and Scaffold Hunter. at University of California, Los Angeles on August 30, 2016 http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from J.Lu and H.A.Carlson</note>

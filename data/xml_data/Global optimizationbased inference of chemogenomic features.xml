				<p>Motivation: Gaining insight into chemogenomic drug–target interactions, such as those involving the substructures of synthetic drugs and protein domains, is important in fragment-based drug discovery and drug repositioning. Previous studies evaluated the interactions locally, thereby ignoring the competitive effects of different substructures or domains, but this could lead to high false-positive estimation, calling for a computational method that presents more predictive power. Results: A statistical model, termed Global optimization-based InFerence of chemogenomic features from drug–Target interactions, or GIFT, is proposed herein to evaluate substructure-domain interactions globally such that all substructure-domain contributions to drug–target interaction are analyzed simultaneously. Combinations of different chemical substructures were included since they may function as one unit. When compared to previous methods, GIFT showed better interpret-ive performance, and performance for the recovery of drug–target interactions was good. Among 53 known drug–domain interactions, 81% were accurately predicted by GIFT. Eighteen of the top 100 predicted combined substructure-domain interactions had corresponding drug–target structures in the Protein Data Bank database, and 15 out of the 18 had been proved. GIFT was then implemented to predict substructure-domain interactions based on drug repositioning. For example, the anticancer activities of tazarotene, adapalene, acitretin and raloxifene were identified. In summary , GIFT is a global chemogenomic inference approach and offers fresh insight into drug–target interactions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Protein domains are independent folding structures and form different proteins as the functional units (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chothia, 1984</ref>). Compared with sequence similarity, domain structures are much more conserved among proteins (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Koehn and Carter, 2005</ref>). Compound chemical substructures, or functional scaffolds, are the basic structural and functional building blocks of small molecules (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bemis et al., 1996</ref>). According to<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bredel and Jacoby (2004)</ref>, chemogenomics, or chemical genomics, involves the systematic screening of targeted chemical libraries of small molecules against individual drug target familieswith the goal of identifying new drugs and drug targets. Thus, gathering chemogenomic data about protein domains and the chemical substructures of drugs underlying drug–target interactions could foster the development of fragment-based drug discovery, drug repositioning and the understanding of drug-induced side effects (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Murray and Rees, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Yamanishi et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Duran-Frigola et al., 2013</ref>), thereby supplementing the network pharmacology methods of target prediction (<ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Zhao and Li, 2010</ref>). Among 1584 FDA-approved drugs and 89 nutraceuticals from the DrugBank database (<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Wishart et al., 2008</ref>), only 30% of them are contained in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) database (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Berman et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gallina et al., 2013</ref>). The large gap between the number of known binding positions and the total number of drug–target pairs calls for computational models to bridge them. Such computational models can be classified as structure-based methods and nonstructure-based methods. Structure-based methods, such as docking, have been developed over the course of many years, but they are constrained by the dependence on three dimensional structures of proteins (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Sousa et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Yang et al., 2013</ref>). In recent years, several non-structure-based methods, which are not limited by the structure information have been developed, along the accumulation of large-scale database in both chemistry and biology.<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Yamanishi et al. (2011)</ref>developed a sparse canonical correspondence analysis method to extract the associated sets of chemical substructures and protein domains from drug–target interactions, but the amount of detectable protein domains was relatively small.<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Takigawa et al. (2011)</ref>applied graph mining and sequence mining to automate the search for significant substructure patterns, leading to the interpretation of polypharmacology in drug–target network. The substructures in drugs or proteins did not need to be defined from the literatures. However, protein substructures, which are generally composed of two or three residues, were difficult to correlate with biological interpretations.<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Tabei et al. (2012)</ref>treated this question as a classification problem in machine learning. They used the logistic regression and support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to seek the drug chemical substructures and protein domains pairs that could be used to determine whether drugs and proteins interact or not. This method showed good results in predicting drug–target interactions. However, none the methods noted above was able to evaluate uncertainty or variance of results, and they also ignored the possible combinations of drug chemical substructures that bind to protein domains as a whole. More importantly, the competitive effects of different substructure–domain interactions have never been considered since prediction has, thus far, been performed locally. Therefore, in this article, a Global optimization-based InFerence of chemogenomic features from drug–target interactions, termed GIFT, was proposed (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>). Since different drug chemical substructures and protein domains may competitively contribute to drug–target interactions, GIFT takes into consideration all the substructure–domain interactions and treats them as latent variables leading to drug–target interactions. A substructure–domain interaction is defined as a direct physical interaction between a chemical substructure and a protein domain, for example, a hydrogen bond between an atom in a chemical substructure and an atom in an amino acids (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gallina et al., 2013</ref>). It should be noted that because some drug–target interactions have not been recorded in DrugBank, we incorporated two parameters, namely fp (false-positive rate) and fn (false-negative rate), to describe data inaccuracy and incompleteness. Then the substructure–domain contributions to different drug–target pairs were globally analyzed by the expectation–maximum (EM) algorithm framework, a statistical method to find the maximum likelihood estimates when the latent variables exist (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dempster et al., 1977</ref>). Variances in results were calculated by the observed Fisher Information (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Efron et al., 1978</ref>). GIFT was further extended to include the combinations of different drug chemical substructures based on the likelihood that some may function together. More than 700 substructure-domain interactions were found by GIFT. Some were validated by the PDB database. Our approach is a promising method for investigating drug–target binding positions and contributes to our understanding in this field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Robust analysis of fn and fp on recovering drug–target interactions</head><p>As noted above, two parameters, fp and fp should be given in GIFT. Based on the assumptions in GIFT (see Section 4), we roughly estimated that the value of fn was no less than 0.4 and the value of fp was no more than 0.001 (see Section 4). To analyze the robustness of GIFT with different parameters, we used 5-fold cross validation to detect the recoveries of drug–target interactions on different combinations of fn and fp. Here the negative samples were randomly selected from the drug–protein pairs without interacting records. The results showed that the performance for recovering drug–target interactions remained stable for different combinations of fn and fp (See<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). In GIFT, fn was set as 0.85 and fp was set as 0.0001. Following the same cross validation procedure above, we compared GIFT with previous methods, namely, L1-log, L1-SVM (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Tabei et al., 2012</ref>), SCCA (<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Yamanishi et al., 2011</ref>) and the association method (see Section 4), based on their performance for recovery of drug–target interactions. The association method was a naive approach to inference of substructure–domain interactions. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the association method is 0.72 (data not shown). Based on the AUC (see<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>), GIFT performed better than the association method, L1-Log method, as well as SCCA, and it was comparable to L1-SVM for predicting drug–protein interactions. Although a large number of substructure–domain interactions were extracted by the previous methods, for example, more than 350 000 interactions by SCCA (<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Yamanishi et al., 2011</ref>), and around 5000 interactions by L1-SVM (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Tabei et al., 2012</ref>), it was difficult to assess the accuracy of these interactions. In the following sections, we demonstrate that GIFT not only perform better for drug–target predictions, but also provided better interpretation of the extracted substructure–domain interactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Performance of prediction on drug–domain interactions</head><p>GIFT was then evaluated for its performance in predicting drug–domain interactions. A total of 108 interactions between 53 proteins and 106 drugs were extracted from the crystallographic structures of known drug–protein interactions in the PDB database (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kruger et al., 2012</ref>). Domains coexisting in the same proteins were merged, so that only multidomain proteins were considered after data preprocessing. Finally 53 pairs of drug–protein interactions including 53 pairs of drug–domain interactions were left. Then the k value was used to describe the number of binding (amino acid) residues of a given drug were located in a given protein domain. Here k value was defined as the proportion of the number of the binding residuals lying within the protein domain over the total number of binding residuals, given a drug–target pair. When k value was larger than 0.5, the drug was considered to interact with the domain (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kruger et al., 2014</ref>). The prediction of drug–domain interactions were followed Equation 2 in Section 4, and each domain was treated as one protein. A drug and a protein domain were predicted to interact if the score given by GIFT was larger than zero. Eighty-one percent of the drug–domain interactions could be predicted by GIFT. The representative results were shown in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>, and the complete results can be found in Supplementary Material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Validation of substructure–domain interactions</head><p>A total of 726 substructure–domain interactions, whose scores, given by GIFT, were larger than their standard deviations, were extracted, including 255 interactions between substructure combinations and domains. Since some chemical substructures may function as one unit, more than 1800 combinations were recorded using the SMARTS format and added in our model (See Supplementary Material). Interactions between combinations of chemical substructures and domains were validated by the known crystal complex containing the relevant drugs and proteins from the PDB database. Eighteen of the top 100 predicted interactions between combinations of chemical substructures and domains have the corresponding drug–target structures in the PDB database, and 15 of the 18 ones were successfully predicted (see<ref type="figure" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>).</p><p>Both methotrexate and pemetrexed are antitumor drugs (<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Wishart et al., 2008</ref>), and can target against the dihydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthase. One combination of the substructures interact with dihydrofolate reductase domain were predicted by GIFT, in good agreement with the real data (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2A</ref>and B). DHF, the methotrexate analog, can also interact with thymidylate synthase and showed the same results (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2C</ref>). It was shown that methotrexate targeted two different domains with the same substructures. Trimetrexate is one agent against amoebiasis and other protozoal disease. Although it lacked one predicted substructure, when compared with methotrexate and pemetrexed, trimetrexate could still target against dihydrofolate reductase domain by the other predicted substructure (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2D</ref>). Since it shares the same functional substructure with methotrexate and pemetrexed, trimetrexate may have similar biological activity. Indeed, it has been tested as an antitumor drugs (<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Wishart et al., 2008</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Interpretation of the drug–protein interactions by GIFT</head><p>We further explored the drug–protein interactions by GIFT, using four different proteins from Homo sapiens: RARA, RXRA, RXRG and ESR1 as examples. All have the ligand-binding domain of<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>. Schematic diagram of GIFT. A.

When k value is larger than 0.5, the drug is considered to interact with the domain. TRUE means the prediction that the drug interacts with the domain by GIFT fits the real data well.Bold black: the drugs. Thin black: the amino acids. All the figures are generated by LigPlot (<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Wallace et al., 1995)</ref>nuclear hormone receptor. ESR1 also contains the oestrogen receptor domain. Using GIFT, several chemical substructures were predicted to interact with the above domains. Drugs having these chemical substructures that can target at least one of the four proteins were shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>. In the original drug-target interactions, tretinon, adapalene and acitretin targeted against RARA, RXRA and RXRG. Fulvestrant, raloxifene and letrozole interacted with ESR1. Tazarotene only targeted RARA. RARA shares the same protein domain as tretinon, adapalene and acitretin target RXRA and RXRG. Based on the results of GIFT, the four drugs have the same chemical substructures predicted to target the ligand-binding domain of nuclear hormone receptor (labeled in black in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>) and they may, therefore, share the same therapeutic functions. Since tretinoin has anticancer bioactivity, it suggests that acitretin, adapalene, tazarotene and raloxifene may have similar anticancer activity similar to that of tretinoin. Meanwhile, fluvestrant has the same predicted chemical substructures with tretinoin, adapalene, and tazarotene. It suggests that fluvestrant may interact with ESR1 by targeting the ligand-binding domain instead of oestrogen receptor domain. Recent researches partly confirm the GIFT prediction above. It is found that adapalene could block cell proliferation and induce apoptosis on hepatoma cells (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ocker et al., 2004</ref>). It was reported that tazarotene profoundly inhibits murine Basal cell carcinoma by inducing PI3K-AKT signaling (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">So et al., 2014</ref>). Acitretin and several analogs exhibited antiproliferative activities against human breast MCF-7 epithelial cells (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Magoulas et al., 2011</ref>). Raloxifene, one of the selective estrogen-receptor modulators, was effective as a preventive choice in reducing the risk of breast cancer for postmenopausal woman (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Vogel et al., 2010</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Global optimization-based inference of chemogenomic features</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Discussion</head><p>In this article, a statistical model, termed GIFT, was constructed to infer the interactions between drug chemical substructures and protein domains based on drug–protein interactions data. For the first time, a global optimization perspective has been introduced into this computation, meaning that all the substructure-domain contributions on drug–target interactions are simultaneously analyzed. GIFT has several advantages compared with previous methods. First, it offers a more detailed description on the drug–protein interactions. Instead of adhering to the constraint which holds that 'similar drugs target similar proteins', we attempt to reveal the possible mechanisms underlying drug–protein interactions. Second, more than 350 000 interactions were predicted by SCCA (<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Yamanishi et al., 2011</ref>), and around 5000 interactions were predicted by L1SVM (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Tabei et al., 2012</ref>). However, these figures represent local estimates, in addition to the lack statistical significance evaluations, thus potentially overestimating substructure–domain interactions. GIFT, on the other hand, can reduce such overestimation by incorporating a global perspective that accommodates variance estimation. It should be noted that GIFT is limited in that it only focuses on two-dimensional chemical space, as presented by the 881 PubChem substructures. Therefore, in the future, three-dimensional structure information should be incorporated into the calculations (See Section 4). As reflected by data already accumulated in the PDB database, more than 20,000 compound-protein interactions can be found, including more than 9000 distinct compounds (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gallina et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">de Beer et al., 2014</ref>). Extraction of these binding information might result in more precise estimations of the substructure-domain interactions in the future. In summary, we propose a novel chemogenomic approach to infer substructure-domain interactions. It provides a chemogenomic view of the mechanisms of drug–protein interactions, and can be used as a new method that contributes to target prediction, drug repositioning and drug combination studies.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Data sources of GIFT</head><p>The information of drug–protein interactions, drug substructures, and protein domains is obtained from<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Tabei et al., 2012</ref>. A total of 1862 drugs are represented by 881-dimensional chemical substructure binary vectors from PubChem database, and 1554 proteins are represented by 876-dimensional protein domain binary vectors from the Pfam database (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bateman et al., 2004</ref>). Here the substructure is defined as a specific kind of two-dimensional chemical fingerprint by CACTVS. 4809 interactions exist between the drugs and the proteins. We deleted the drug chemical substructures or protein domains that never appeared in the drugs or proteins, and we merged those substructures or domains that appeared in the same drugs or proteins. The drug–domain interactions were extracted from PDB database by the script from Kruger et al., 2012. We only chose proteins that had multiple domains for our data. Finally, 53 pairs of drug–protein interactions with the records of drug–domain interaction were used.</p></div>

Inspired by the work (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Deng et al., 2002</ref>), we herein propose a statistical method to evaluate the possible interactions between drug chemical substructures and protein domains. For our calculations, it was assumed that (i) the interactions of the drug chemical substructures and the protein domains are independent, given a pair of a drug and a protein pair; (ii) interactions between a given drug chemical substructure and protein domain would remain unchanged between different pairs of the drugs and proteins containing them, as shown by</p><formula>h mn ¼ PrðD ðijÞ mn ¼ 1Þ (1)</formula><p>in which h mn ¼ PrðD mn ¼ 1Þ; (iii) drug and the protein will interact if, and only if, one pair of chemical substructures and domains from them interact.

The value of fn then would be no less than 0.41. We estimate fp in a similar way and it would be no more than 0.001.

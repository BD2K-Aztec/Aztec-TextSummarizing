				<p>Motivation: Whole genome and exome sequencing of matched tumor–normal sample pairs is becoming routine in cancer research. The consequent increased demand for somatic variant analysis of paired samples requires methods specialized to model this problem so as to sensitively call variants at any practical level of tumor impurity. Results: We describe Strelka, a method for somatic SNV and small indel detection from sequencing data of matched tumor– normal samples. The method uses a novel Bayesian approach which represents continuous allele frequencies for both tumor and normal samples, while leveraging the expected genotype structure of the normal. This is achieved by representing the normal sample as a mixture of germline variation with noise, and representing the tumor sample as a mixture of the normal sample with somatic variation. A natural consequence of the model structure is that sensitivity can be maintained at high tumor impurity without requiring purity estimates. We demonstrate that the method has superior accuracy and sensitivity on impure samples compared with approaches based on either diploid genotype likelihoods or general allele-frequency tests.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Driven by declining sequencing costs, human tumor sequencing has recently progressed from surveys of selected coding regions (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Sjöblom et al., 2006</ref>) to entire genomes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Ley et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Pleasance et al., 2010</ref>), and onwards to increasingly routine genome and exome sequencing of diverse tumor samples (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Meyerson et al., 2010</ref>). A principal goal of such experiments is the identification of somatic variants arising in the tumor, typically by comparing the tumor sequence to that of a matched normal sample. The increasing number of such paired tumor–normal sequencing experiments has put greater demand on the accuracy and efficiency of somatic variant * To whom correspondence should be addressed. calling methods, particularly for SNVs and small indels where the number of somatic variants can easily overwhelm manual review. An additional challenge for somatic variant calling on matched tumor– normal samples is robust handling of impurity and copy-number variation in the tumor sample, ideally without requiring external purity estimates. The somatic variant calling problem addressed in this study requires the identification of alleles in a tumor which do not occur in the host's germline. This apparently simple process is confounded by at least two factors. The first is that germline variants can outnumber somatic variants by several orders of magnitude [e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Pleasance et al. (2010)]</ref>, so any tendency to mistake germline variation as somatic can substantially contaminate the somatic variant predictions. A second complicating factor is variability in the somatic allele frequencies due to the presence of normal cells in the tumor sample, copy number variation and tumor heterogeneity. In earlier work somatic variants have been detected by independently genotyping both samples and subtracting the results, an approach which can provide reasonable predictions for cell lines because the aforementioned variability in somatic allele frequency is reduced for this case. For the general case, a joint analysis of both samples should improve results by facilitating tests for candidate somatic alleles in both samples (especially important for indels) and enabling better representation of sequencing noise and tumor impurity. Two prevalent approaches to joint sample analysis are (i) to use joint diploid genotype likelihoods for both samples and (ii) to disregard such genotype structure and test whether a shared allele frequency between the two samples can be rejected. An implementation of the first approach is available in the SomaticSniper package (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Larson et al., 2012</ref>), whereas the second approach is implemented in VarScan, which applies Fisher's exact test to the sample allele frequencies (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Koboldt et al., 2009</ref>). Note that these approaches to joint sample analysis stand in contrast to solutions addressing the related problem of independent tumor sample analysis, such as in SNVMix (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Goya et al., 2010</ref>), although both cases share the challenge of non-diploid tumor allele frequencies. In this study we describe Strelka, a somatic variant detection workflow designed to accurately and efficiently identify somatic SNVs and small indels from aligned sequencing reads of matched tumor–normal samples. Strelka is based on a novel Bayesian approach wherein the tumor and normal allele frequencies are treated as continuous values, with the normal sample represented as a mixture of diploid germline variation with noise, and the tumorsample represented as a mixture of the normal sample with somatic variation. Beyond the core modeling scheme, the Strelka workflow is designed to improve accuracy by jointly performing indel search and read realignment in the context of both samples. The model is structured to account for any level of allele frequency variation in the tumor sample without requiring purity estimates. We test Strelka's somatic variant predictions together with alternate calling approaches to estimate accuracy and sensitivity on a tumor cell line and a mixture of tumor cell line and normal sequences designed to simulate an impure tumor sample. This analysis suggests that Strelka's results are comparable to or better than existing methods for both somatic SNV and indel prediction on the pure cell line, while demonstrating Strelka's distinguishing characteristic, per its design, of robust call sensitivity on the lowpurity sample. Strelka is designed for production use on very large sample sets, and thus achieves these results as a single workflow with reasonable computational efficiency: for the largest dataset analyzed in this study the method completes somatic variant analysis in 81 core-hours given roughly 180-fold human genome sequencing coverage from the combined tumor and normal samples.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Sequencing and data preparation</head><p>The tumor and matched normal samples used in this study are the metastatic melanoma cell line COLO-829 and COLO-829BL, a lymphoblastoid line derived from the same patient. These samples were sequenced to produce paired-end 100 base reads on Illumina HiSeq instruments using TruSeq v3 chemistry. The samples were sequenced on two flowcells, AB01DHACXX and BB0065ACXX, hereafter referred to as flowcells 1 and 2, respectively. All analyses in this study are based on four lanes of COLO-829 and three lanes of COLO-829BL from flowcell 1 and four lanes of each sample from flowcell 2. The sequences were aligned, PCR-duplicate marked and sorted into BAM format using CASAVA 1.8 (http://www.illumina.com/documents/ products/technotes/technote_eland_variantcalling_improvements.pdf). The alignment and all subsequent analyses in this study use the hg19 human reference genome. The sequencing data for both samples have been deposited at the European Genome-Phenome Archive (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/) under accession number EGAS00001000245.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Candidate indel detection</head><p>The first step in Strelka's workflow (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>) is a search for candidate indels to be used in the subsequent realignment and somatic indel calling steps. Any indel can become a candidate unless: (i) the number of reads containing the indel in the combined tumor and normal samples is &lt;3 (ii) the number of reads containing the indel in both of the individual samples is &lt;10% of the total depth for indels shorter than 5 bases, or &lt;2% otherwise. This search process produces a single shared candidate indel set used to realign both samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Realignment</head><p>Reads are realigned following candidate indel detection. Different aspects of the realignment results are used for SNV and indel calling. The somatic SNV calling uses one exemplar alignment for each read based on the alignment probability computed from the basecall qualities. If there are nearly equiprobable alignments for either end of the read, the ambiguous segments are marked as soft-clipped and not used for SNV calling. For somatic indel calling, the search process provides the best alignments for each read when the candidate indel is included and excluded. The two resulting alignment scores form the basis of the single-sample indel likelihood computation. Realignment search details are described in Supplementary Methods.<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Li et al., 2009</ref>) for the tumor and normal samples, and ultimately produces a set of somatic SNV and indel calls in variant call format (VCF;<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Danecek et al., 2011)</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3">Somatic caller overview</head><p>Following realignment, the somatic variant caller uses the read alignment information from both samples to produce a somatic variant probability. The somatic caller models allele frequencies rather than diploid genotypes, representing the normal sample as a mixture of diploid germline variation with noise, and the tumor sample as a mixture of the normal sample with somatic variation. The somatic variant probability produced by this model is not used directly because it detects many variants in loss of heterzygosity (LOH) or copy number change regions. Instead, each call is reported using the joint probability of a somatic variant and a specific genotype in the normal sample, summarized as a quality score. In this study the somatic calls are selected to have a homozygous reference normal genotype, thus the quality scores discussed below express the probability that each variant is both somatic and has a homozygous reference genotype in the normal sample. An additional feature of the somatic caller is that it uses two calling tiers to reduce false positives. The first tier (tier1) is a set of input data filtration and model parameter settings with relatively stringent values, whereas the second tier (tier2) uses more permissive settings. All calls are initially made using tier1 settings, after which the variant is called again using tier2. Strelka reports the minimum of the two somatic call qualities: Q = min(Q tier1 ,Q tier2 ). Filtration of input reads is substantially influenced by these calling tiers. At tier1, Strelka removes all read pairs with a mapping quality &lt;40, in addition to read pairs with only a single end mapped or with an anomalous insert size. At tier2 only read pairs with a mapping quality &lt;5 are removed from the input. Note that tier1 thresholds are applied to the reads which determine the candidate indel set, however all reads participate in the subsequent realignment step.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.4">Post-call filtration</head><p>The somatic calling model accounts for only a few common error terms detectable from the local sequence context. To approximately handle other error types, filters are applied to the raw SNV and indel calls as the final step of Strelka's workflow. All results discussed in this study pertain to the filtered variants. Strelka filters the following variant calls: (i) All calls with a normal sample depth &gt;3 times the chromosomal mean (meant to remove e.g.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Somatic variant calling with Strelka</head><p>the call site (iv) Somatic indels with a reference repeat count &gt;8 (i.e. the indel is an expansion/contraction of a homopolymer longer than 8 bases, a dinucleotide repeat longer than 16 bases, etc.) (v) Somatic indels where &gt;30% of basecalls have been filtered out in a window extending 50 bases to either side of the indel's call position (vi) Somatic indels overlapping 'interrupted homopolymers' of length &gt;15. An interrupted homopolymer is the longest homopolymer intersecting or adjacent to the called indel when a single non-homopolymer base is allowed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Somatic variant calling model</head><p>For both SNVs and indels, the somatic calling model approximates a posterior probability on the joint tumor and normal allele frequencies.</p><formula>P(f t ,f n | D) ∝ P(D | f t ,f n )P(f t ,f n )</formula><p>Here f t ,f n refer to the tumor and normal allele frequencies and D are the sequencing data from both samples. The likelihood term above is computed from independent sample-specific allele frequency likelihoods,</p><formula>P(D|f t ,f n ) = P(D t |f t )P(D n |f n ),</formula><p>where D t and D n indicate tumor and normal sample data. The single-sample SNV and indel likelihoods could in principal be supplied by any probabilistic variant caller, Strelka currently provides its own samplespecific variant likelihoods (described in Supplementary Methods). The joint allele-frequency prior distribution is detailed in the following section. The allele frequency posterior is used to compute the somatic variant probability given somatic state</p><formula>S = {(f t ,f n ) : f t = f n } P(S | D) = ft ,fn I s (f t ,f n )P(f t ,f n | D) where I s (f t ,f n )</formula><p>is the somatic state indicator function. As previously discussed, this somatic variant probability is not ideal for detecting variants of interest because it does not distinguish somatic variant types. We therefore associate somatic calls with the joint probability of somatic variation and the normal sample genotype P(S,G n |D) = P(S|D)P(G n |D n ), with the normal sample diploid genotype posterior P(G n |D n ) computed using a conventional single-sample Bayesian approach detailed in Supplementary Methods. The Strelka workflow uses two calling tiers, thus all somatic calls are classified according to their most-likely normal genotype if that value is the same in tiers 1 and 2, and classified as conflicts otherwise. As noted in the somatic caller overview, all analyses in this study are restricted to somatic calls with homozygous reference normal genotypes, thus all Strelka quality scores discussed below express P(S,G n = 'ref/ref'|D).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">Joint allele-frequency prior</head><p>The prior probability on the tumor and normal allele-frequencies P(f t ,f n ) encodes the concept that the normal sample is a mixture of diploid germline variation and noise whereas the tumor sample is a mixture of the normal sample and somatic variation. For each sample, the allele frequencies must sum to one and have at most two non-zero values. For SNV calling the alleles are the four bases {A,C,G,T}, whereas for indel calling there are two alleles, the indel and the reference. The allele frequency term f also includes a strand-bias indicator variable f (s b ), where f (s b ) = 1 designates that the non-reference allele occurs at the indicated frequency on one strand only, and all alleles are modeled as strand-symmetric otherwise. The term f * refers to the allele frequencies from f without the strand-bias variable. Note that strand-bias is currently modeled for SNVs but not indels. The marginal prior for the normal sample frequencies is a mixture of expected diploid variation with a noise term P(</p><formula>f n ) = P diploid (f n )(1−μ)+ P noise (f n )μ.</formula><p>The noise term abstracts various sequencing, read mapping and assembly issues which could produce an unexpected allele frequency shared in the tumor and normal samples. For the SNV and indel models the noise contribution is set to μ SNV = 5×10 −7 and μ indel = 1×10 −7. Given P(f n ), the joint frequency prior is</p><formula>P(f t ,f n ) = ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ P(f n )(1−P(S)) if f n = f t P(f n )P(S)U (f * t ) if f n = f t ,f n (s b ) = 0,f t (s b ) = 0 0 otherwise where U (f * t )</formula><p>is a uniform distribution over the allowed tumor allele frequencies. The somatic state prior P(S) is set to 1×10 −6 for both SNVs and indels. Note that P(S) is expected to scale the somatic variant probabilities but not substantially influence their rank, thus its values were chosen empirically to provide reasonable variant probabilities and are not adjusted for different samples in practice. The expected diploid variation in the normal sample P diploid (f n ) is defined for the canonical diploid allele frequencies and 0 otherwise. It can be described in terms of α = f n (a ref ), the frequency of the reference allele and</p><formula>β = f n (a 2 )/f n (a 1 )</formula><p>, the allele frequency ratio of the first and second most frequent alleles, a 1 and a 2 , respectively. For SNVs and indels this is</p><formula>P diploid,SNV (f n ) = ⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ θ SNV /3 if α = 0.5 θ SNV /6 if α = 0,β = 0 θ 2 SNV /3 if α = 0,β = 0.5 1−3θ SNV /2+θ 2 SNV if α = 1 P diploid,indel (f n ) = ⎧ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎩ θ indel if α = 0.5 θ indel /2 ifα = 0 1−3θ indel /2 ifα = 1</formula><p>where the heterozygosity terms are θ SNV = 1×10 −3 and θ indel = 1×10 −4. The normal sample noise distribution is a mixture of conventional and single-strand noise</p><formula>P noise (f n ) = (1−σ )P noise (f * n | f n (s b ) = 0)+σ P noise (f * n | f n (s b ) = 1)</formula><p>where σ is the single-strand noise fraction, set to 0.5 for snvs and 0 for indels. The strand-symmetric noise component P noise (f * n | f n (s b ) = 0) is uniform over the allowed frequency space f * , but re-weighted such that the probability mass of each frequency axis (the frequency distribution between each allele pair) matches the distribution among frequency axes in P diploid (f n ). The strand-bias noise component P noise (f * n | f n (s b ) = 1) is non-zero for a subset of the allele frequencies, allowing mixtures of the reference allele with one non-reference allele at a frequency of ≤0.5. The strand-bias noise prior is uniform over this allowed frequency subset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">Practical computation</head><p>The continuous allele frequencies modeled above are efficiently computed by dividing each allele-pair axis into a set of equidistant points and performing the somatic probability computation over the resulting discrete point set. Several point resolutions were attempted to confirm the expected stability and convergence of results as resolution increased. A resolution of 11 points per axis is used for all computations in this study, We expect that this resolution should be increased for improved detection of somatic allele frequencies lower than 10%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Alternate somatic variant-caller workflows</head><p>Varscan results are computed from VarScan version 2.2.7, and pileup output for each BAM file was generated using samtools version 0.1.17 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Li et al., 2009</ref>). The mapping quality cutoff for pileup generation was set to 40, to match the tier1 cutoff used by Strelka. VarScan's 'somatic'module was run on the pileup output using the default settings, except when the method was run on the 'Low Purity' sample set, in which case a tumor purity setting of 0.4 was provided to indicate the simulated purity of this sample. To reduce VarScan's output to the gain of allele somatic call type analyzed in this study, we filtered all VarScan calls with support for the variant allele in the normal. As a final filtration step, we applied Strelka's high-depth call filter by removing all calls where the normal sample depth was higher than the filtration threshold defined for each chromosome by Strelka. To produce SomaticSniper results, we installed version 1.0.0 of the program bam-somaticsniper and ran this with default settings except for using a minimum mapping quality of 40 to match the cutoff used in VarScan and Strelka. Following the guidelines outlined in the SomaticSniper study, we replicated the 'Standard' filtering procedure<ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. Somatic variant call overlap with known germline variation. Somatic SNVs and indels were called from the 'High Depth' tumor/normal sequence set (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>) using Strelka and alternate methods. For each method we show the results at a series of stringency levels, indicated by the minimum accepted somatic quality score shown for each point. (A) Overlap of somatic SNV calls with the common subset of dbSNP build 132 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Sherry et al., 2001</ref>). The dbSNP 'common' subset was obtained from the UCSC Genome Browser database (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Fujita et al., 2011</ref>). This set only includes SNPs which map to a single genomic location and have a minor allele frequency of at least 1%.<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">DePristo et al., 2011)</ref>except that no filtering was performed for calls matching dbSNP entries. This exception was made because we use dbSNP overlap to evaluate somatic call quality for the various workflows below. As with VarScan we removed all calls with support for the variant allele in the normal and applied Strelka's high-depth call filter. The quality values used to describe the stringency cutoffs of SomaticSniper calls are obtained as Phred score transformations of the Somatic Score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B A</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RESULTS</head><p>We tested Strelka on new sequencing results for COLO-829, a melanoma sample and COLO-829BL, a lymphoblastoid cell line from the same patient. As described in Section 2, these samples were sequenced on two flowcells to produce a total aligned depth of 93× and 86× for the tumor and normal samples respectively. The first flowcell (FC1) included four lanes for the tumor and three lanes for the normal, whereas the second flowcell (FC2) included four lanes for each sample. These data were combined into several comparison sets (detailed in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>) for the purpose of testing different aspects of somatic call quality. Somatic SNV calls are compared with the predictions from two existing methods, VarScan and SomaticSniper, whereas somatic indel calls are compared with VarScan only. Each somatic caller was configured to exclude calls associated with regional LOH or copy number changes, thus the evaluated variants represent gain of allele mutations from the homozygous reference state in the normal sample. In each test we examine somatic caller results at a series of stringency levels, summarized as the minimum accepted quality score for the somatic variants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Somatic call overlap with population variants</head><p>We tested the somatic variants for overlap with known variants in the human population to identify spurious somatic calls caused by germline variation. Although it is possible for a somatic variant to coincidentally match a variant identified as segregating in the human population, such calls are far more likely to be non-somatic.<ref type="figure">Figure 2A</ref>details the overlap of several SNV sets to the common subset of dbSNP. For all three variant callers we observe the expected behavior of decreasing dbSNP overlap with increasing call stringency. We also observe that Strelka's dbSNP overlap is lower than either alternate method for any call stringency, consistent with a lower rate of miscalling germline variants as somatic.In Figure 2B a similar approach is used to evaluate somatic indel calls. As with the SNVs, overlap of the somatic indel calls with population indels decreases at greater stringency for both methods. However we observe a much higher overlap with population variants for the somatic indels. This may be explained by the relatively high rates of both true variants and spurious indel noise in microsatellites and tandem repeats (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Levy et al., 2007</ref>), due to polymerase slippage and other factors. Such indel hotspots can lead to overlap between population variants and somatic predictions in two ways: (i) coincidental occurrence of the same indel variant in the population and the tumor cell line; and (ii) occurrence of spurious indel noise at the same location as a population variant. To illustrate this point, the Strelka indel calls at Q30 or higher from<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>can be classified as to whether they represent expansions or contractions of a repeating unit with five or more copies. Note that repeat counts larger than eight have already been filtered out. The 'high repeat' indel set from above has a population indel overlap of 10.5% (190 calls) while those with shorter repeats have an overlap of 3.3% (462 calls). Apart from this issue, we observe that Strelka exhibits a relatively lower overlap with the population indels given the same total number of somatic indel calls, likely reflecting Strelka's above noted filtration of longer repeats in addition to joint sample candidate indel discovery and explicit modeling of expected allele frequencies in the normal sample. We provide as Supplementary Material all non-synonymous Strelka coding variants from the 'High Depth' sequence set used in the above comparisons. These include all calls with quality scores of at least 15 for SNVs and 30 for indels, yielding 216 missense and 17 non-sense SNVs, in addition to 7 coding indels as annotated from Ensembl release 64 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Flicek et al., 2012</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Technical replicate subtraction</head><p>Somatic calls can also be evaluated by analyzing replicated sequencing runs of the same sample, and treating the replicates as an artificial matched tumor–normal pair. All somatic calls made in this case will be false positives, reflecting a mixture of errors from sequencing and the somatic caller. To conduct such a test we used COLO-829BL data from the 'High Depth' comparison set and divided it by flowcell to create a 'Normal Replicate' comparison set. We also created a 'Replicate Companion' comparison set containing true tumor–normal sequencing data, but using only one flowcell per sample so as to approximately match the depth of the 'Normal Replicate' set (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). In addition to matching depth, the 'Normal Replicate' and 'Replicate Companion' sets also both compare data between flowcells so that any flowcell artifact will be similar in both.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>shows the variant calling results on the above data sets. As expected, the ratio of normal replicate to tumor–normal calls declines as stringency increases across all methods for both SNVs and indels. For Strelka and SomaticSniper we observe a rapid decline in somatic calls on the normal replicate set, and for Strelka there are no somatic SNVs and indels called on the normal replicate at ≥Q50. In general Strelka provides a lower ratio of normal replicate to tumor–normal calls compared with alternate methods, except for indels at low call stringency. This is likely due to the additional filtration used by Strelka on both somatic calls and input data. Such filtration steps use thresholds fixed to a specific sensitivity/specificity tradeoff which is not relaxed when selecting for variant calls at lower quality scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Sensitivity of somatic calls at low purity</head><p>To investigate false negative calls we test each method for detection of the validated somatic variants from<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Pleasance et al. (2010)</ref>. To better understand the influence of tumor purity on the false negative rate, we also assembled a 'Low Purity' comparison set from the melanoma and normal sequences, which was designed to simulate a tumor sample at 40% purity. To do so we consider the melanoma cell line (COLO-829) to be a pure sample and combine a subset of its sequences with those from its matched normal to produce a mixture sample with 40% melanoma sequence and depth similar to that of the pure melanoma sample (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). This scheme necessitates reuse of normal (COLO-829BL) sample sequences in both parts ofThe sensitivity of the somatic variant callers is evaluated on a set of validated somatic SNVs and indels in COLO-829 at 100% purity ('High Depth' comparison set) and at simulated 40% purity ('Low Purity' comparison set). In all cases the sensitivity is compared with the total number of calls made at 100% purity. Parts (A), (B) and (C) describe the results for somatic SNVs and parts (D), (E) and (F) for somatic indels. Parts (A) and (D) show the percent of validated variants detected by each method at 100% purity for SNVs and indels respectively. Parts (B) and (E) show the same results for variants detected at 40% purity. Parts (C) and (F) compare the total number of somatic calls at 40% purity to the number called at 100%. These results demonstrate a pronounced reduction in performance of alternate methods at reduced tumor purity levels compared with Strelka, reflecting the fact that Strelka's somatic call model is designed for arbitrary allele frequencies in the tumor sample the 'Low Purity' comparison set, so this set should not be used to evaluate false positive calls. The validated calls from<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Pleasance et al. (2010)</ref>include 454 SNVs and 66 indels. These variants were mapped to hg19 from their published positions on the hg18 reference using the UCSC Genome Browser liftover utility. Although we use the full set of validated calls in our subsequent evaluation, we note that for eight SNVs and four indels, the validated somatic allele is either absent from the tumor or present in the normal at the hg19 liftover location in the 'High Depth' sequence set.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4</ref>summarizes the sensitivity results. Figures 4A and D show the fraction of validated calls detected from the pure melanoma sequence. For this case the number of validated variants detected by all methods is not substantially influenced by call stringency, reflecting the sample purity and high sequencing depth. The only validated SNV calls missed by Strelka at all stringency settings are the eight cases of possible liftover artifact discussed above. Strelka also misses 20 validated indels at all stringency settings, 8 of these indels have quality scores of at least 60 but are removed by the repeat filter for long homopolymers and dinucleotides.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Somatic variant calling with Strelka</head><p>Figure 4B and E show the fraction of validated somatic variants detected from the 'Low Purity' comparison set. In this case call stringency has a much greater influence on sensitivity. Both of the alternate calling methods exhibit a consistent relationship between sensitivity and call stringency, whereas for both SNVs and indels, Strelka reaches a quality value where the number of validated calls begins to fall off from a plateau, reflecting an approximate limit to the quality scores assigned to variant calls in the lower purity data. Even with this sensitivity drop-off, Strelka shows reasonable sensitivity at 40% purity compared with the pure sample. For both VarScan and SomaticSniper, the reduced sensitivity to validated variants at 40% purity is partially explained by fewer calls made overall at the same quality value compared with the pure sample. This trend is illustrated in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4C</ref>and F, which shows the number of variants called at 40% purity compared with the pure sample. This reduction in total calls made at lower purity is particularly noticeable for SomaticSniper, for which SNV calls are reduced by over 50% compared with the pure sample at all plotted stringency levels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DISCUSSION</head><p>In the above analysis we demonstrate that the somatic calls made by Strelka (i) have a low fraction of population variants and thus are likely to contain few erroneous germline calls; (ii) are infrequent when the method is used to compare a normal sample against itself; and (iii) retain high sensitivity when the tumor sample is impure. We note that all Strelka results presented in this study use the same model and filtration parameters, and per Strelka's design the model parameters need not be adjusted based on the tumor or normal sequencing depth or expected tumor purity. The alternate methods we examine represent two families of somatic variant calling approaches, each of which has advantages and drawbacks compared with Strelka's. Methods which use a diploid genotype likelihood for both tumor and normal samples should perform well on high-purity samples. This is evident for SomaticSniper, which makes very few spurious somatic calls when run against a normal replicate sample. Any remaining performance differences on cell line data may be an artifact of using the ELAND read mapper and Strelka's extra post-call filtration steps. SomaticSniper is also extremely efficient, completing analyses in approximately one seventh of the time required by Strelka. The principal cost of this approach is apparent when testing sensitivity on low purity data, in which case SomaticSniper shows the greatest reduction in sensitivity between the impure and pure test data. The approach of applying a general statisical test against the tumor and normal allele frequencies, as implemented in VarScan, has the significant advantage of being robust to a variety of sample conditions such as contamination or alternate ploidy in the normal sample. An analogous approach using a uniform allele frequency prior for the normal sample was attempted in Strelka, but not pursued due to a relative lack of power in situations where the current model assumptions hold. This trend is also evident in the VarScan results showing that tumor purity has a relatively high impact on somatic call sensitivity. Nonetheless, the generality of VarScan's approach is a great advantage for many sample subtraction problems. Although not applied in this study, Strelka is designed to optionally accept contigs from a local de-novo assembly routine to enable detection of longer somatic indels and open breakends. Items for future work include extending the model to represent normal sample contamination and integrating the post-call filtration terms with the current somatic quality score. The latter improvement has recently been demonstrated for single-sample variant calls using a machine learning approach (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">DePristo et al., 2011</ref>), and would enable call selection based on a single score representing both the core somatic call probability and post-call filtration terms, improving selection of low-stringency variant calls.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig.1.</head><figDesc>Fig. 1.

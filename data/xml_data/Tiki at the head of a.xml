				<p>Tiki proteins appear to antagonize Wnt signalling pathway by acting as Wnt proteases, thereby affecting Wnt solubility by its amino-terminal cleavage. Tiki1 protease activity was shown to be metal ion-dependent and was inhibited by chelating agents and thus was tentatively proposed to be a metalloprotease. Nevertheless, Tiki proteins exhibit no detectable sequence similarity to previously described metalloproteases, but instead have been reported as being homologues of TraB proteins (Pfam ID: PF01963), a widely distributed family of unknown function and structure. Here, we show that Tiki proteins are members of a new superfamily of domains contained not just in TraB proteins, but also in erythromycin esterase (Pfam ID: PF05139), DUF399 (domain of unknown function 399; Pfam ID: PF04187) and MARTX toxins that contribute to host invasion and pathogenesis by bacteria. We establish the core fold of this enzymatic domain and its catalytic residues.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Wnt signalling is a key developmental pathway controlling both embryonic development and tissue maintenance by regulation of stem cell proliferation in adults. Aberrant activation of the Wnt signalling pathway can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation. Wnt-related diseases are extensive in number and include neurodegenerative disease, inflammatory bowel disease, cleft lip/palate disorders and various cancers (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Herr et al., 2012</ref>). The first Wnt gene was discovered 430 years ago, and despite extensive research into this signalling pathway, it has remained unclear how Wnt morphogen levels and activities are regulated. In large part, this is because of the vast numbers of Wnt isoforms, receptors, co-receptors and different secreted antagonists encoded in animal genomes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bouldin and Kimelman, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Vincent and Magee, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Willert and Nusse, 2012</ref>). Our understanding of Wnt signalling has recently been advanced substantially by the characterization of Tiki1, a gene which when over-expressed in Xenopus embryos results in head enlargement; Tiki refers to large-headed humanoid carvings in Polynesian cultures. Tiki1, and its paralogue Tiki2, antagonize Wnt activity upstream of its receptors (<ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Zhang et al., 2012</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Computational protein sequence analysis. The TIKI domain.</head><p>Initially, we performed a sequence similarity search using the human Tiki1 protein as query using BLAST (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Altschul et al., 1997</ref>). A multiple sequence alignment of Tiki homologous sequences was generated with T-Coffee (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Notredame et al., 2000</ref>) and used as input to make a profile using HMMER2 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Eddy, 1996</ref>). Iterative profile versus sequence searches against the UniRef50 protein sequence database (<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Wu et al., 2006</ref>) identified a conserved region that more clearly defines the family of Tiki homologous proteins (corresponding to amino acids 52–331 of human Tiki1). The resulting Tiki alignment is extended relative to the TraB Pfam family (PF01963) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Punta et al., 2012</ref>), which subsequently provided greater power to identify remote homologies. We then compared sequence conservation profiles from different protein families using HHpred (So¨ding<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">So¨ding et al., 2005</ref>) against Pfam (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Punta et al., 2012</ref>) and pdb70 profile databases (So¨ding<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">So¨ding et al., 2005</ref>). Our first finding was that the conserved region in the Tiki/TraB family is similar in sequence to domain of unknown function 399 (DUF399) proteins (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bateman et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chan et al., 2006</ref>) and to a family of erythromycin esterases (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Morar et al., 2012</ref>) (<ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>) (E-value: 1.7 Â 10 À3 ; Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S1</ref>). Both families have structurally characterized members: for the DUF399 family, ChaN [protein data bank (PDB)]: 2G5G) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chan et al., 2006</ref>) was identified as a heme interacting protein, although no enzymatic function for this protein was suggested. The erythromycin esterase family has two structurally characterized members: BcR136 (PDB: 2QGM) and BcR135 (PDB: 2RAD &amp; 3B55) (Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium, unpublished). A detailed functional characterization, including active site identification and structural interpretation, was recently published for the erythromycin esterase EreB protein (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Morar et al., 2012</ref>). The structural similarity between DUF399 and erythromycin esterase families has already been described by<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Morar et al. (2012)</ref>(Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S2</ref>). Unexpectedly, in the subsequent profile-versus-profile comparison analysis, we then also found sequence similarity to close homologues of the Pasteurella multocida Toxin (PMT, also known as the Dermonecrotic Toxin) (E-value: 6.9 Â 10 À2 ; Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S1</ref>); this sequence similarity was restricted to the C2-2 domain whose tertiary structure is known in PMT (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kitadokoro et al., 2007</ref>). The C2-2 domain-containing family is made up of multidomain protein toxins such as PMT and MARTX proteins from Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio vulnificus and *To whom correspondence should be addressed. ß The Author 2013.

Multiple sequence alignment of representative TIKI domain-containing families. Multiple sequence alignments for each family (Tiki/TraB, erythromycin esterase, DUF399 and Dermonecrotic toxins/MARTX) were generated with the program T-Coffee (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Notredame et al., 2000</ref>) using default parameters, slightly refined manually and visualized with the Belvu program (<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Sonnhammer and Hollich, 2005</ref>). The final superfamily alignment was generated using a combination of profile-to-profile comparisons (So¨ding<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">So¨ding et al., 2005</ref>) and sequence alignments derived from structural superpositions for those families whose structure is known (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Holm and Sander, 1995</ref>). Active site residues are labelled and coloured according to reference protein sequences: Tiki1, ChaN (DUF399 family), erythromycin esterase family member BcR136 (PDB: 2QGM, Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium, unpublished) and V.vulnificus MARTX in blue, grey, red and green, respectively. Families of TIKI domain-containing proteins are indicated by coloured bars to the left of the alignment: TIKI/TraB, DUF399, erythromycin esterase, C2-2 Dermonecrotin Toxin in blue, grey, red and green, respectively. Secondary structure predictions (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Jones, 1999</ref>) were performed for the TIKI/TraB family (show in ss_pred lane), these are consistent with X-ray determined secondary structures of the DUF399 family member ChaN (PDB: 2G5G) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chan et al., 2006</ref>Aeromonas hydrophila (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Jeong and Satchell, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Kwak et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lee et al., 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lee et al., , 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lee et al., , 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lo et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Suarez et al., 2012</ref>), as well as bacterial effector proteins from Pseudomonas syringae and Erwinia amylovora (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Mansfield et al., 2012</ref>). MARTX toxins, the most experimentally studied group of this family, are large proteins characterized by the presence of RtxA repeats (Pfam ID: PF07634) at the N and C termini, essential for translocation of the central portion of the toxin across the eukaryotic plasma membrane. After autoproteolysis of the holotoxin, at the host cell cytosol, the effector domains located in the central region of the toxin are released, which possess critical functions in toxinosis, and promote colonization and evasion of host immune system (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Geissler et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Roig et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Satchell, 2011</ref>). The C2-2 domain is one such effector domain whose function in pathogenesis has remained unknown. The unexpected finding of sequence similarity between erythromycin esterases and close homologues of PMT, prompted us to compare their known protein tertiary structures, which subsequently were revealed as being similar (PDB codes 2QGM and 2EBF; DALI Z-score ¼ 7, root-meansquare-deviation of superimposed alpha-carbon atoms ¼ 3.6 A ˚ over 126 aligned residues with 13% identity; Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Holm and Sander, 1995</ref>). The shared core domain contains four beta-strands and five alpha-helices, precisely where the catalytic residues described in the esterase structure are located (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S2</ref>) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Morar et al., 2012</ref>). Three reasons likely explain why these remote homologous relationships between C2-2 domains of bacterial toxins, erythromycin esterase/DUF399 and Tiki/TraB families had hitherto escaped detection: (i) the insertion of a non-conserved helical region that interrupts this domain (<ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>and Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S3</ref>); (ii) the low degrees of sequence identity among the different members of the superfamily; and (iii) the absence of the putative catalytic residues in the C2-2 domain of the structurally characterized PMT (see TOXA_2EBF sequence in<ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>), which are otherwise conserved in many members of this family of bacterial toxins (see representative members shown in green in<ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>and Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S3</ref>). Reciprocal profile versus profile similarity searches produced convergent results, which is strongly indicative of homology (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S1</ref>). No further homologues were identified in subsequent sequence similarity searches. Additionally, a secondary structure prediction was performed for the TIKI/TraB family (ss_pred lane in<ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>and Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S3</ref>) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Jones, 1999</ref>), showing good agreement with the known secondary structure of different members of the superfamily (lanes: 2C5G, 2QGM and 2EBFX in<ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>and Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S3</ref>). The described similarities in sequence and structure provide strong evidence that TIKI/TraB, erythromycin esterase, DUF399 and C2-2 domain-containing proteins families form a new superfamily of enzymes. We term the domain common to all of these proteins 'TIKI', as it lies at the head of this large and diverse superfamily.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Reaction mechanism and active site conservation</head><p>TIKI superfamily proteins appear to catalyze different hydrolytic (esterase or protease) reactions and are characterized by a number of conserved amino acids (<ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>and Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S3</ref>) that form part of the recently described erythromycin esterase active site (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Morar et al., 2012). Morar et al.</ref>showed that the Escherichia coli erythromycin esterase EreB activity is highly dependent on two amino acids (H46 and E74 in EreB; H84 and E112 in Bcr136), which correspond to human Tiki1 (H60 and E87). It is notable that these two amino acids, together with structurally adjacent basic residues (R304 and H332 in Tiki1), are highly conserved across TIKI domain proteins (<ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>and Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S3</ref>). Consequently, we propose that enzymatically active TIKI domain proteins adopt the catalytic mechanism of the erythromycin esterase family wherein a conserved His– Glu pair activates a water molecule, which acts as a nucleophile to hydrolyse a carbonyl group, which is common to both ester and peptide bonds (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Morar et al., 2012</ref>). The proposed metal ion-dependence described for Tiki1 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Zhang et al., 2012</ref>) and EreA (erythromycin esterase family) may not be extended to all TIKI superfamily members because the reaction mechanism is metal ion-independent and resistant to chelating agents in EreB and Bcr136 members of the erythromycin esterase family (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Morar et al., 2012</ref>).<ref type="figure">1</ref>.

			<note place="foot" n="3"> CONCLUSION Our analyses demonstrate that human TIKI proteins lie at the head of a widely phyletically distributed protein superfamily that includes not only the TraB family but also erythromycin esterase, DUF399 and MARTX families. Furthermore, our identification of likely active site residues in TIKI and MARTX proteins should assist experiments that investigate the function of these critical proteins in different human pathologies and encourage the development of drugs that target the identified TIKI superfamily conserved active centre of enzymes, with key roles in antibiotic resistance (erythromycin esterase family), bacterial toxinosis (MARTX and Dermonecrotic toxin families) and the Wnt signalling pathway (TIKI family). During completion of this work, Bazan et al. (2013) reported similar results that focused on the description of the TIKI/TraB subfamily. Our work complements these results by presenting a more extensive description and annotation of sequence conservation in the predicted active site across TIKI subfamilies.</note>

				<p>Motivation: Modelling the 3D structures of proteins can often be enhanced if more than one fold template is used during the modelling process. However, in many cases, this may also result in poorer model quality for a given target or alignment method. There is a need for modelling protocols that can both consistently and significantly improve 3D models and provide an indication of when models might not benefit from the use of multiple target-template alignments. Here, we investigate the use of both global and local model quality prediction scores produced by ModFOLDclust2, to improve the selection of target-template alignments for the construction of multiple-template models. Additionally, we evaluate clustering the resulting population of multi-and single-template models for the improvement of our IntFOLD-TS tertiary structure prediction method. Results: We find that using accurate local model quality scores to guide alignment selection is the most consistent way to significantly improve models for each of the sequence to structure alignment methods tested. In addition, using accurate global model quality for re-ranking alignments, prior to selection, further improves the majority of multi-template modelling methods tested. Furthermore, subsequent clustering of the resulting population of multiple-template models significantly improves the quality of selected models compared with the previous version of our tertiary structure prediction method, IntFOLD-TS.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Sequence-structure alignment methods are the springboard of template-based modelling (TBM). The 3D model output of singletemplate modeling methods is based on the top-ranked best available single template from the most similar protein of known structure (<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Tramontano and Cozzetto, 2011</ref>). Single-template models built for sequences with high-sequence identity (50–60%), between target * To whom correspondence should be addressed. and template, are known to provide highly accurate models; &lt;30% sequence identity (the twilight zone), models must be built using more intensive fold recognition methods (<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Tramontano et al., 2008</ref>). Consensus-based fold recognition approaches such as LOMETS (<ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Wu and Zhang, 2007</ref>), 3D-Jury (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ginalski et al., 2003</ref>), 3DSHOTGUN (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Fischer, 2003</ref>), Pcons (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lundstrom et al., 2001</ref>) and IntFOLD-TS (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">McGuffin and Roche, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Roche et al., 2011</ref>) improve the selection of single-templates by the use of alternative models from several independent servers or in-house version of those methods run as metaservers. The top-ranked consensus models, however, may not always be the best option due to suboptimal alignments. It is important to consider optimal alignments both at the global (overall protein sequence) and local (regions such as domains) levels. In addition, the coverage of the targettemplate alignment must be considered when evaluating or selecting 3D models to guide experimental work. After all, the nearer-native a protein model is, the better information it can provide towards protein design for use in medicine, agriculture, biofuels and other fields of applications. Multiple-template modelling methods that mix and match (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Liu et al., 2008</ref>), recombine templates (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Contreras-Moreira et al., 2003</ref>) or thread alternative target-template alignments (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Peng and Xu, 2011a</ref>,b) have been produced in an effort to improve the quality of predicted 3D models. The advantage of using multiple-template methods is mainly attributed either to the increased alignment coverage or the incorporation of the best single template, which is dependent on alignment accuracy (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Larsson et al., 2008</ref>) and template complementarity (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Chakravarty et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Peng and Xu, 2011a</ref>,b). Additionally, convergence (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Chakravarty et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Martínez et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Wallner and Elofsson, 2003</ref>) is one problem identified in the use of multiple templates, which may arise from different alignments containing contradictory information. The quality of a model can be improved by combining complementary good templates, which is especially true for multi-domain targets; but model quality may deteriorate when there is one template that is closer to the target than all other available templates. In general, multiple-template modelling can improve on single-template models when it can provide an increase in coverage of the target, can give more useful information such as sequence and structure conservation and/or conserved distance restraints or can identify better alternative alignments for harder targets (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Cheng, 2008</ref>quality prediction as the remaining limiting factors (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Mariani et al., 2011</ref>). The top-performing groups have attempted to address these limiting factors in numerous ways (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Peng and Xu, 2011a</ref>). Various single-template and consensus methods incorporate Model Quality Assessment (MQA) methods to rank alternative models (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Kryshtafovych et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">McGuffin, 2010</ref>). PconsM (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Larsson et al., 2011</ref>), for example, uses ProQ (<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Wallner and Elofsson, 2003</ref>) for model quality assessment of the top six models drawn from the top six template sequences of Pcons.net (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Wallner et al., 2007</ref>). On the other hand, RaptorX (Peng and Xu, 2011b) uses TM-score (<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Xu and Zhang, 2010</ref>; Zhang and Skolnick, 2004) as a quality measure of the sequence-template alignment, from which the quality of its 3D model can be estimated. Additionally, MULTICOM (<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Wang et al., 2010;</ref>) combines multiple templates, alternative alignments and similar models guided by global model quality assessment. Furthermore, with I-TASSER (known as Zhang-Server in CASP) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Roy et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Zhang, 2008</ref>), the multi-template 3D models include global confidence scores, which are a measure of their overall prediction accuracy. Our own IntFOLD-TS method (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">McGuffin and Roche, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Roche et al., 2011</ref>) integrates ModFOLDclust2 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">McGuffin and Roche, 2009</ref>) into the core of its pipeline. This MQA tool reranks all alternative models, generated by four in-house versions of single-template methods, based on their global quality scores. The accuracy of this method addressed the strong emphasis of CASP9 on assessment of all-atom models producing predicted per-residue errors (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Mariani et al., 2011</ref>). However, while we were relatively successful at providing accurate local error estimates for our CASP9 models, we did not make any attempt at fixing the predicted errors prior to submission. In an attempt to exploit our accurate per-residue quality predictions, we have now explored the multipletemplate modelling approach described here. Our approach is to use the ModFOLDclust2 local and global quality assessment scores, from the initial single template models, to inform target-template alignment selection, with the aim of consistently and significantly improving models through multiple-template modeling. The latest implementation of our template-based modelling server, IntFOLD2TS, uses a further iteration of ModFOLDclust2 to rank the resulting pool of multiple-template models. Our new IntFOLD2-TS method shows a statistically significant improvement over the singletemplate methods and consensus single-template methods tested.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Datasets and benchmarks</head><p>Single-and multiple-template modelling methods were evaluated on both the CASP8 and CASP9 datasets using the full chain sequences for each target. Official native 3D structures for full chains and domains were obtained from the CASP website: http://predictioncenter.org/download_area/. The observed model quality for the generated models was assessed using the TM-score program (<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zhang and Skolnick, 2004</ref>) (http://zhanglab.ccmb.med. umich.edu/TM-score/) to generate structural alignment scores namely; TMscores (<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Xu and Zhang, 2010</ref>); GDT_TS (<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Zemla et al., 2001</ref>) scores and MaxSub (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Siew et al., 2000</ref>) scores. A statistical analysis of the relative performance of all the methods was carried out using the Wilcoxon signedrank sum test with the R statistical package, version v2.12.1 (http://www. R-project.org). The statistical significance of the differences in observed model quality scores (TM-scores, GDT_TS-scores and MaxSub scores) was reflected by the calculated P-values produced by these tests. To generate the P-values, we used the R command: wilcox.test(x, y, paired=TRUE, alternative= " greater " ), where x and y were vectors of observed model quality scores from different methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Single-template modelling methods and clustering or consensus methods</head><p>Nine different fold recognition methods were installed and run in-house to generate up to 10 sequence-to-structure alignments each, resulting in up to 90 alternative single-template-based models being generated for each CASP target. The fold recognition methods used were SP3 and SPARKS2 (referred to hereafter as SPK2) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Zhou and Zhou, 2005</ref>), HHsearch (Soding, 2004), COMA (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Soding et al., 2005</ref>) and the five alternative threading methods that are integrated into the current LOMETS (<ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Wu and Zhang, 2007</ref>) package— QQQ, GGGd, GGGf, NNNd and SSSc (http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich. edu/I-TASSER/download/). For each single-template method, the associated template libraries were screened so that they only included templates for structures that existed in the RCSB PDB (www.pdb.org) yearly snapshots (ftp://snapshots.rcsb.org/) taken prior to the start of each of the CASP experiments. For example, for the CASP8 target sequences, the template libraries for methods included only the structures that were available in the PDB on the January 7, 2008. Likewise, for the CASP9 targets, the template libraries included only the structures that were available in the PDB on the January 4, 2010. Furthermore, the UniProt (http://www.uniprot.org) sequence databases were also appropriately screened using a method similar to that carried out by<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Chubb et al. (2010)</ref>. The sequence databases from the January 7, 2008, to the January 4, 2010, were recreated using the uniprot_trembl.fasta file and deposition date field found within the associated uniprot_trembl.dat file: ftp:// ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/. In addition to the individual methods described earlier, clustering-based approaches were used to generate consensus single-template models. The LOMETS method was installed locally and used with default settings to select a consensus from a pool of 50 models from 5 methods: QQQ, GGGd, GGGf, NNNd and SSSc. In addition, the IntFOLD-TS40 method used the ModFOLDclust2 method with default parameters to select a consensus from a pool of 40 models from 4 methods: SP3 and SPARKS2, HHsearch and COMA. (N.B. This was similar to the approach we used for the IntFOLDTS server method during CASP9; however, in this case, we only used single-template models and we used older template libraries and sequence databases—see previous paragraph.) Finally, the IntFOLD-TS90 method used the ModFOLDclust2 method with default parameters to select a consensus from a pool of 90 models produced by all 9 single-template methods (N.B. while methods such as LOMETS and IntFOLD make use of multiple templates, in this article, we define multi-template modelling methods as those that use several alignments to alternative templates to build an individual model for a given target.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Alignment selection methods for multiple-template modelling</head><p>A number of simple target-template alignment selection protocols were followed and evaluated for the value added to each of the single-template modelling based methods described earlier. For each method, a multiple alignment file was generated, in PIR format, using the individual targetto-template alignments and Modeller v9.8 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Fiser and Sali, 2003</ref>) was subsequently used to generate multi-template models using the default parameters and scripts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">Method 1 (multi1)</head><p>The top two alignments generated by the singletemplate modelling method were used to generate a multi-template model for each sequence to structure alignment method. In the analysis carried out by<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Larsson et al. (2008)</ref>, performance was observed to peak when just the top two target-to-template alignments were used to generate multi-template models, so this was the rationale behind this method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Improvement of 3D protein models</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">Method 2 (multi2)</head><p>For this method, the top alignment was used along with any subsequent alignments, if greater than or equal to 40 new residues were covered, and if the overlapping regions of covered residues was less than or equal to 20 residues. If no subsequent alignments were identified, then a model was built using the top alignment only. This is similar to the alignment selection successfully used by<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hildebrand et al. (2009</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3">Method 3 (multi3)</head><p>This method made use of the ModFOLDclust2predicted per-residue errors to guide the alignment selection process if target-template alignments were found to overlap. The top alignment and any subsequent alignments were included if any overlapping residues in the model (built using the subsequent alignment) were predicted to result in fewer local error scores than those occurring in the models built using the preceding alignments. The mean local error scores were taken for the overlapping regions covered by the new residues and then compared with the best mean local scores from the equivalent local regions previously covered. If the mean local errors for the overlapping regions were found to be reduced, then the alignment was included. If no subsequent alignments were identified, a model was built using the top alignment only.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.4">Method 4 (multi4)</head><p>This method was based on the observations made by<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Larsson et al. (2008</ref>) that when extra templates do not add any extra coverage to the aligned target sequence, there is little advantage to be gained from multiple-template modelling. Thus, for this method the top alignment was used and any subsequent alignments were also included, but only if they increased coverage of the target by at least 1 residue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.5">Methods 5, 6, 7 and 8 (multi5 to multi8)</head><p>Another observation made by<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Larsson et al. (2008)</ref>was that the global predicted model quality (particularly for the first two alignments) was one of the most important factors for successful multi-template modelling. Therefore for methods 5, 6, 7 and 8, we repeated methods 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. However, prior to alignment selection, the alignments for each of the nine single-template methods were firstly re-ranked based on the ModFOLDclust2 predicted global model quality scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Iteration of clustering for IntFOLD2-TS: running ModFOLDclust2 on the resulting set of multi-template models</head><p>The multi-template modelling alignment selection methods described earlier resulted in the generation of a new population of 84 models for each target (eight new models each for SP3, SPARKS2, HHsearch, COMA, QQQ, GGGd, GGGf, NNNd and SSSc, plus four new models each for LOMETS, IntFOLD-TS40 and IntFOLD-TS90). These models were then assessed using ModFOLDclust2 and the top-ranked models were designated as the IntFOLD2-TS predictions. A flowchart of the complete modelling pipeline is shown in Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RESULTS</head><p>Three structural alignment scoring methods—the GDT_TS (Global Distance Test Total Score), the TM-score (Template Modelling score) and the MaxSub score—provide the performance metrics for the benchmarking. These scores, generated by the TM-score method, show how similar two protein structures are to each other, in this case, the model and the experimentally determined native structure. For clarity and brevity, the results shown in this article are the benchmarking results against the CASP9 full chain dataset. However, the full analyses for both the CASP8 and CASP9 full chain and domain datasets (with and without FM domains) are shown in the supplementary data. Furthermore, in the supplementary data, an analysis of the upper limits for multi-template modelling based on perfect model selection is shown. In this case, the TM-score between the model and native structure is used to determine the global quality for each model. The perfect local quality scores are calculated as the distances between equivalent CA atoms based on the TM-score superposition between the model and native structures. Although all structural alignment scores were used for benchmarking, the main tables and figures shown here were based on the GDT_TS score, which has been used as an official CASP measure since CASP4. The 9-fold-recognition methods that represent single-template modelling methods are as follows: SP3, SPARKS2 (SPK2), HHsearch, COMA, QQQ, GGGd, GGGf, NNNd and SSSc. The consensus methods that cluster-specific single-template methods and generate single-template models are represented here by LOMETS, IntFOLD-TS40 and IntFOLD-TS90. The multi-template methods applied to sets of alignments from individual methods are denoted by the subscript '_multi*' (e.g. sp3_multi3 is the multi-template modelling Method 3 applied to the SP3 alignments).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Single-template and consensus modelling methods</head><p>An all-against-all pairwise comparison matrix of 12 tertiary structure modelling methods is presented in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. Calculated Wilcoxon signed-rank sum test P-values that populate the matrix were computed based on the GDT_TS scores of CASP9 full chain targets. A significant difference between any two methods is established by P-value of ≤0.05 which suggests an improved performance by the method. Given the ≤0.05 P-value threshold, it can be said that the top three performers, as shown in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>(values in boldface), are SP3, IntFOLD-TS40 and IntFOLD-TS90. The SP3 method outperformed 8 out of 11 of the other single-template models. However, SP3 did not perform significantly better than HHsearch (and vice versa) and only IntFOLD-TS40 and IntFOLD-TS90 significantly outperformed the method. IntFOLD-TS40 P-values were better in 10 out of 11 methods, and IntFOLD-TS90 significantly outperformed all methods. Slight variations of results can be seen in the P-values of the rest of the full chain and domain datasets of CASP8 and CASP9 and using different scoring metrics (Supplementary Tables). However, the consensus method, IntFOLD-TS90, was the consistent top performer, showing statistically significant improvements over methods, across all datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Multiple-template modelling based on original alignment rankings from the single-template modelling methods</head><p>The multiple-template models referred to as multi1, multi2, multi3 and multi4 used information drawn from the top-ranked and subsequent ranked alignments based on the original single-template method rankings. The improvement in model quality from each multi-template modelling method is referred to here as the addedvalue.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>shows a plot of the relative added-value (or cost) of multitemplate modelling arrived at by totalling all the GDT_TS scores of all targets for each method. The sum of each single-template method is then subtracted from the sum of each corresponding multipletemplate method as well as from the sum of each consensus method. This difference, whether positive or negative, represents the addedvalue or cost, respectively, of using each multiple-template method over single-template modelling.H o : The method in the row produces models that are equal or lower in quality than those produced by the method in the column. H 1 : the method in the row produces higher quality models than the method in the column.H o : The method in the column produces models that are equal or lower in quality than those produced by the method in the row. H 1 : the method in the column produces higher quality models than the method in the row. P-values ≤0.05 indicate significant differences (in boldface). The Wilcoxon signed-rank sum testP−values were calculated using GDT_TS scores of 117 CASP9 full chain targets.</p><p>The histogram for GDT_TS scores in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>shows that the multi3 method adds value to each of the single-template modelling methods. The highest relative added-value is for COMA; the lowest, for QQQ. While the single highest added-value calculated is from the multi4 method for HHsearch, this method also recorded the highest cost for SPK2. Fluctuations between overall added value and cost were noted for both multi1 and multi4. The added values or costs associated with using multi2 were all marginal. Across CASP8 and CASP9 datasets, similar trends in the added-value or cost associated with each multi-template modelling method were noted (see Supplementary Figures). The added-value is the essential criterion providing answer to the question 'Which is the best multi-template modelling method?'.<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>informs not only on the significant differences between paired multiple-template and single-template or clustering/consensus methods but also identifies the best multiple-template selection approach. Again, a P-value ≤0.05 suggests a significant difference between two methods and the method with ≤0.05 P-value possesses a better model quality. Similar tables for other datasets and scoring metrics are shown in the Supplementary Tables.The 'multi3' method consistently outperformed almost all the single-template and consensus/clustering methods across all datasets. The only exception was IntFOLD-TS90 for CASP9 full chain targets (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>). Likewise, multi1 and multi4 methods performed well over some single-template and consensus/clustering methods although their performance was inconsistent across CASP8 and CASP9 datasets. Multi2 trailed the other three methods in terms of performance; and in some cases did not improve on the performance of any methods (Supplementary Tables).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Multiple-template modelling methods using ModFOLDclust2 re-ranked alignments</head><p>The histogram in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref>is interpreted in the same way as<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>, but in this case, the target-template alignments from each single-template method are first re-ranked according to the ModFOLDclust2 global scores for the resulting models (IntFOLDTS40, IntFOLD-TS90 and LOMETS already use clustering to rank models by predicted global quality, so there is no need to rerank).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Improvement of 3D protein models</head><p>HHsearch and COMA derived most of the improvement from multi-template modelling based on the CASP9 dataset (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref>). COMA was the most consistently improved using all multi-template modelling methods for both the CASP8 and CASP9 targets. QQQ, GGGd, GGGf, NNNd and SSSc were the least improved overall, and in some cases, did worse when benchmarked against the CASP8 dataset. The cost to SP3 and SPK2 from multiple-template modelling was reduced by re-ranking alignments, and SPK2_multi5 showed a positive added-value compared with SPK2_multi1. Improvements are evident across all methods shown by higher cumulative scores; however, it is the multi7 method (the multi3 method using re-ranked alignments) that shows consistent improvements according all plots. The results in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>suggest that re-ranking alignments by using ModFOLDclust2 global quality scores is providing additional value to each of the multiple template modelling methods tested.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">IntFOLD2-TS—a consensus approach using multi-template models</head><p>The IntFOLD2-TS method is a consensus approach that uses ModFOLDclust2 to rank the multiple-template models produced using all methods (multi1–multi7) and all target-template alignment methods (a total of 84 models). Here, the results are shown variously as cumulative model quality scores in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>(Supplementary Figures) and as calculated P-values for the pairwise Wilcoxon signed-rank sum tests shown in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>(Supplementary Tables).<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>shows the incremental improvements to cumulative GDT_TS scores from the multi-template modelling methods multi3 and multi7, put in context within the consensus single-template approaches and the consensus multi-template approach used by the IntFOLD2-TS method. The cumulative score for SP3 singletemplate modelling provides the baseline score. The models built from SP3 alignments are improved by 2.76% using the multi3 multi-template modelling method, beyond the level achieved by the consensus single-template approach used by IntFOLD-TS40. A further improvement in the cumulative score (3.70%) can be seen using the multi7 method where alignments are re-ranked using ModFOLDclust2, prior to selection. In addition, IntFOLD-TS40 and IntFOLD-TS90 methods have improved scores using the multi3 method. However, the highest cumulative score is for IntFOLD2-TS (9.97%), which is gained by using ModFOLDclust2 to cluster the multi-template models from all methods. A similar trend is shown in Supplementary Tables using alternative datasets and scoring metrics with the IntFOLD2-TS method providing the highest cumulative score in all tests. The pairwise matrix of P-values in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>shows the significance of differences between methods. Significant improvements (P&lt;0.05) over the baseline method SP3 are shown by using the consensus single-template methods (IntFOLD-TS40 and IntFOLDTS90) and the multiple-template modelling approaches (SP3_multi3 and SP3_multi7). Furthermore, the new IntFOLD2-TS method provides significantly higher quality models than all other methods (Supplementary Tables). The incremental refinements brought about by consensus/ clustering method and the multiple-template methods shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>, are illustrated structurally for an example target (T0623) in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 4</ref>. The PyMOL (http://www.pymol.org) cartoon views of superpositions depict where the improvements of the models (grey) have been made relative to the native structure (white). The target's native structure was solved by X-ray diffraction (PDB ID 3NKH).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DISCUSSION</head><p>In this article, we evaluate alternative methods for the selection of target-template alignments for multiple-template modelling, using the alignments generated by a number of alternative single-template modelling methods. We explore the use of ModFOLDclust2 local and global model quality assessment scores as a discriminatory measure to refine the selection of better target-template alignmentsH o : The method in the row produces models that are equal or lower in quality than those produced by the method in the column. H 1 : the method in the row produces higher quality models than the method in the column. P-values ≤0.05 indicate significant differences (in boldface). The Wilcoxon signed-rank sum test P-values were calculated using GDT_TS scores of 117 CASP9 full chain targets.prior to multi-template modelling. Although there is a basic nuance that using multiple templates will translate into a better model, this is shown not to be true in all cases and success is dependent on the target-template selection method used. Comprehensive analyses of our multiple-template models showed that there are appropriate combinations of templates that will lead to improvement of a model quality over that of the single-template model. When that combination is not found, then multiple-template modelling will not provide a better option over single-template modelling and may sometimes lead to a deterioration of model quality. The aim of multiple-template modelling should not be to simply 'mix and match' segments of templates to achieve more coverage; it should, most importantly, be to improve model quality. From benchmarking the alternative alignment selection approaches on the CASP8 and CASP9 full chain and domain datasets, we have found that the most consistent way to significantly improve models is to make use of accurate predicted local model quality scores to guide alignment selection. Furthermore, using accurate global quality prediction scores, for re-ranking the order of alignments prior to selection, significantly improves most of the multi-template modelling methods tested. This corroborates the findings of<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Larsson et al. (2008)</ref>. The upper theoretical limits of these strategies are investigated through use of perfect model quality assessment scores (Supplementary Tables and Figures). The results indicate that there is room for improvement and it is therefore worthwhile putting further effort into developing more accurate model assessment to guide multi-template modeling. Overall, SP3 proved to be a competitive single-template method when tested on the CASP9 datasets and it provides a useful baseline single template modelling method. The increased performance of both IntFOLD-TS40 and IntFOLD-TS90 relative to SP3 points again to the usefulness of generating consensus single-template models using ModFOLDclust2. However, these simple consensus methods only make use of the ModFOLDclust2 global scores and do not exploit the accurate per-residue error predictions. According to the CASP9 assessors accurate per-residue error predictions are crucial indicators of a model's usefulness. Here, we are now capitalizing on the accuracy of ModFOLDclust2 for predicting model quality at both the global and per-residue level, using identified errors in single template models to guide alignment selection for multi-template modelling. The multi3 and multi7 methods were observed to be the best performing methods and they consistently and significantly improved model quality for all of the original sequence-structure alignment methods, on all datasets and according to all model quality scoring metrics. The multi3 works by simply rejecting any subsequent target-template alignment after the top hit, if the overlapping local regions from the alignment are not predicted to improve the local model quality according to ModFOLDclust2. The multi7 method uses essentially the same approach but the targettemplate alignments for each method are firstly re-ordered using the ModFOLDclust2 global scores.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Improvement of 3D protein models</head><p>In comparison, the methods multi2, multi4, which were based on improving alignment coverage, and the multi1 method were not as consistent. The multi1 and multi4 methods worked well for some sequence-structure alignment methods such as HHsearch. However, these methods often lead to lower quality models, on average, particularly when applied to the SPK2 and SP3 alignments. The HHsearch method, which generates optimal local alignment, to alternative templates, may benefit more from any additional coverage by alternative templates, whereas the SP3 and SPK2 methods will attempt to thread the full sequence even if some local regions are not adequately covered by a single template. The multi2 method is a bit more conservative than the multi1 and multi4 methods; in most instances, using the method leads to a marginal improvement in model quality. In some cases, there is a cost associated with using the multi2 method; however, it is never as detrimental as using multi1 and multi4 methods. In many cases, the multi1, multi2 and multi4 alignment selection methods can be made more consistent by firstly re-ranking target-template alignments using ModFOLDclust2 (multi5, multi6 and multi8, respectively), but again this does not work in all cases. Multi-template modelling using the target-template alignment methods described here leads to the generation of a new population of models that are of higher model quality on average than the population of single template models. This is demonstrated by the improved performance achieved by the IntFOLD2-TS method which uses ModFOLDclust2 to rank the population of 84 multi-template models, versus the IntFOLD-TS90 method which only ranks the initial population of single-template models. The IntFOLD2TS method has been incorporated into the new IntFOLD server (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Roche et al., 2011</ref>), which will be tested during the CASP10 prediction season, where it is registered as IntFOLD2, as well as being continuously assessed by the CAMEO3D server (http://www. cameo3d.org/), where it is currently listed as development server12. The server will shortly be made freely publicly available via http:// www.reading.ac.uk/bioinf/IntFOLD/. In addition, we freely provide the source code and executables for the multi-template modelling methods described here for use with any set of sequence-to-structure alignments and associated quality assessment file provided in CASP QMODE2 format.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><figDesc>003 3.01E-001 3.00E-003 2.91E-002 2.97E-002 7.62E-003 4.55E-003 2.77E-004 1.75E-002 9.57E-001 0.9998 SPK2 9.98E-001 1.0000 9.16E-001 1.15E-001 8.15E-001 6.78E-001 5.98E-001 5.36E-001 1.62E-001 8.27E-001 0.9996 1.0000 HHsearch 7.00E-001 8.48E-002 1.0000 1.07E-003 4.45E-001 2.39E-001 1.44E-001 1.19E-001 3.35E-002 3.38E-001 9.76E-001 0.9999 COMA 9.97E-001 8.86E-001 9.99E-001 1.0000 9.92E-001 8.90E-001 9.26E-001 8.87E-001 7.86E-001 9.83E-001 1.0000 1.0000 QQQ 9.71E-001 1.86E-001 5.56E-001 8.12E-003 1.0000 3.84E-001 9.18E-002 1.66E-002 5.95E-002 5.19E-001 9.95E-001 1.0000 GGGd 9.71E-001 3.23E-001 7.62E-001 1.10E-001 6.17E-001 1.0000 2.02E-001 1.08E-001 1.00E-001 6.76E-001 9.93E-001 1.0000 GGGf 9.92E-001 4.03E-001 8.57E-001 7.48E-002 9.09E-001 8.00E-001 1.0000 3.88E-001 2.03E-001 9.16E-001 9.99E-001 1.0000 NNNd 9.95E-001 4.65E-001 8.82E-001 1.14E-001 9.84E-001 8.92E-001 6.14E-001 1.0000 3.22E-001 9.60E-001 0.9996 1.0000 SSSc 0.9997 8.38E-001 9.67E-001 2.15E-001 9.41E-001 9.00E-001 7.99E-001 6.80E-001 1.0000 9.63E-001 9.99E-001 1.0000 LOMETS 9.83E-001 1.74E-001 6.63E-001 1.68E-002 5.00E-001 3.26E-001 8.45E-002 4.07E-002 3.73E-002 1.0000 9.97E-001 1.0000 IntFOLD–TS40 4.38E-002 3.97E-004 2.46E-002 4.08E-005 4.57E-003 7.17E-003 9.50E-004 3.91E-004 5.46E-004 2.97E-003 1.0000 9.97E-001 IntFOLD–TS90 1.69E-004 9.08E-007 7.27E-005 3.43E-008 4.64E-008 1.90E-009 2.62E-009 7.99E-010 3.69E-009 6.80E-008 3.30E-003 1.0000</figDesc></figure>

				<p>Motivation: Circadian rhythms date back to the origins of life, are found in virtually every species and every cell, and play fundamental roles in functions ranging from metabolism to cognition. Modern high-throughput technologies allow the measurement of concentrations of transcripts, metabolites and other species along the circadian cycle creating novel computational challenges and opportunities, including the problems of inferring whether a given species oscillate in circadian fashion or not, and inferring the time at which a set of measurements was taken. Results: We first curate several large synthetic and biological time series datasets containing labels for both periodic and aperiodic signals. We then use deep learning methods to develop and train BIO_CYCLE, a system to robustly estimate which signals are periodic in high-throughput circadian experiments, producing estimates of amplitudes, periods, phases, as well as several statistical significance measures. Using the curated data, BIO_CYCLE is compared to other approaches and shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics. We then use deep learning methods to develop and train BIO_CLOCK to robustly estimate the time at which a particular single-time-point transcriptomic experiment was carried. In most cases, BIO_CLOCK can reliably predict time, within approximately 1 h, using the expression levels of only a small number of core clock genes. BIO_CLOCK is shown to work reasonably well across tissue types, and often with only small degradation across conditions. BIO_CLOCK is used to annotate most mouse experiments found in the GEO database with an inferred time stamp.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The importance of circadian rhythms cannot be overstated: circadian oscillation have been observed in animals, plants, fungi and cyanobacteria and date back to the very origins of life on Earth. Indeed, some of the most ancient forms of life, such as cyanobacteria, use photosynthesis as their energy source and thus are highly circadian almost by definition. These oscillations play a fundamental role in coordinating the homeostasis and behavior of biological systems, from the metabolic (Eckel<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mahan and Sassone-Corsi, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Froy, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Takahashi et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yoo et al., 2004</ref>) to the cognitive levels (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Eckel-Mahan et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gerstner et al., 2009</ref>). Disruption of circadian rhythms has been directly linked to health problems (<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Knutsson, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lamia et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Takahashi et al., 2008</ref>) ranging from cancer, to insulin resistance, to diabetes, to obesity and to premature ageing (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Antunes et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Froy, 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Froy, , 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Karlsson et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kohsaka et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Kondratov et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Sharifian et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Shi et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Turek et al., 2005</ref>). At their most fundamental level, these oscillations are molecular in nature, whereby the concentrations of specific molecular species such as transcripts, metabolites and proteins oscillate in the cell with a 24 h periodicity. Modern high-throughput technologies allow largescale measurements of these concentrations along the circadian cycle thus creating new datasets and new computational challenges and opportunities. To mine these new datasets, here we develop and apply machine learning methods to address two questions: (i) which molecular species are periodic? and (ii) what time or phase is associated with high-throughput transcriptomic measurements made at a single timepoint? At the molecular level, circadian rhythms are in part driven by a genetically encoded, highly conserved, core clock found in nearly every cell based on negative transcription/translation feedback loops, whereby transcription factors drive the expression of their own negative regulators (<ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Partch et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schibler and SassoneCorsi, 2002</ref>), and involving only a dozen genes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Partch et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yan et al., 2008</ref>). In the mammalian core clock (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>), two bHLH transcription factors, CLOCK and BMAL1 heterodimerize and bind to conserved E-box sequences in target gene promoters, thus driving the rhythmic expression of mammalian Period (Per1, Per2 and Per3) and Cryptochrome (Cry1 and Cry2) genes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Stratmann and Schibler, 2006</ref>). PER and CRY proteins form a complex that inhibits subsequent CLOCK:BMAL1-mediated gene expression (<ref type="bibr">Brown et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dibner et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Partch et al., 2014</ref>). The master core clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Moore and Eichler, 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Ralph et al., 1990</ref>) of the hypothalamus interacts with the peripheral core clocks throughout the body (<ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Takahashi et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yoo et al., 2004</ref>). In contrast to the small size of the core clock, high-throughput transcriptomic (DNA microarrays, RNA-seq) or metabolomic (mass spectrometry) experiments (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Andrews et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Eckel-Mahan et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hughes et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Masri et al., 2014b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Miller et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Panda et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">P.Tognini et al., in preparation)</ref>, have revealed that a much larger fraction, typically on the order of 10%, of all transcripts or metabolites in the cell are oscillating in a circadian manner. Furthermore, the oscillating transcripts and metabolites differ by cell, tissue type, or condition (<ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Panda et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Storch et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yan et al., 2008</ref>). Genetic, epigenetic and environmental perturbations—such as a change in diet—can lead to cellular reprogramming and profoundly influence which species are oscillating in a given cell or tissue (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bellet et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Dyar et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Eckel-Mahan et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Masri et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Masri et al., , 2014a</ref>). When results are aggregated across tissues and conditions, a very large fraction, often exceeding 50% and possibly approaching 100%, of all transcripts is capable of circadian oscillations under at least one set of conditions, as shown in plants (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Covington et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Harmer et al., 2000</ref>), cyanobacteria and algae (<ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Monnier et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Vijayan et al., 2009</ref>) and mouse (<ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Patel et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2014</ref>). In a typical circadian experiment, high-throughput omic measurements are taken at multiple timepoints along the circadian cycle under both control and treated conditions. Thus the first fundamental problem that arises in the analysis of such data is the problem of detecting periodicity, in particular circadian periodicity, in these time series. The problem of detecting periodic patterns in time series is of course not new. However, in the cases considered here the problem is particularly challenging for several reasons, including: (i) the sparsity of the measurements (the experiments are costly and thus data may be collected for instance only every 4 h); (ii) the noise in the measurements and the well known biological variability; (iii) the related issue of small sample sizes (e.g. n ¼ 3); (iv) the issue of missing data; (v) the issue of uneven sampling in time; and (vi) the large number of measurements (e.g. 20 000 transcripts) and the associated multiple-hypothesis testing problem. Here we develop and apply deep learning methods for robustly assessing periodicity in high-throughput circadian experiments, and systematically compare the deep learning approach to the previous, non-machine learning, approaches (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Glynn et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hughes et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yang and Su, 2010</ref>). While this is useful for circadian experiments, the vast majority of all high-throughput expression experiments have been carried, and continue to be carried, at single timepoints. This can be problematic for many applications, including applications to precision medicine, precisely because circadian variations are ignored creating possible confounding factors. This raises the second problem of developing methods that can robustly infer the approximate time at which a single-time high-throughput expression measurement was taken. Such methods could be used to retrospectively infer a time stamp for any expression dataset, in particular to improve the annotations of all the datasets contained in large gene expression repositories, such as the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Edgar et al., 2002</ref>), and improve the quality of all the downstream inferences that can be made from this wealth of data. There may be other applications of such a method, for instance in forensic sciences, to help infer a time of death. In any case, to address the second problem we also develop and apply deep learning methods to robustly infer time or phase for single-time high-throughput gene expression measurements.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Periodicity inference from time series measurements</head><p>To train and evaluate the deep learning methods, we curate BioCycle, the largest dataset including both synthetic and real-world biological time series, and both periodic and aperiodic signals. While the main goal here is to create methods to analyze real-world biological data, relying only on biological data to determine the effectiveness of a method is not sufficient because there are not many biological samples which have been definitively labeled as being periodic or aperiodic. Even when one can be confident that a signal is periodic, it can be difficult to determine the true period, phase and amplitude of that signal. Therefore, we rely also on synthetic data to provide us with signals that we can say are definitely periodic or aperiodic, and whose attributes—such as period, amplitude, and phase—can be controlled and are known. Furthermore, previous approaches were developed using synthetic data and thus the same synthetic data must be used to make fair comparisons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">Synthetic data</head><p>We first curate a comprehensive synthetic dataset BioCycle Synth, which includes all previously defined synthetic signals found in JTK_Cycle (<ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hughes et al., 2010</ref>) and ARSER (<ref type="bibr">Yang and Su, 2010</ref>), but also contains new signals. BioCycle Synth is in turn a collection of two different types of datasets: a dataset in which signals are constructed using mathematical formulas (BioCycle Form) , and a datasetDeep learning approaches for circadian rhythms i9 in which signals are generated from a Gaussian process (<ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Rasmussen, 2004</ref>) (BioCycle Gauss). In previous work, synthetic data was generated with carefully constructed formulas to try to mimic periodic signals found in real-world data (see below). While this gives one a lot of control over the data, it can create signals that are too contrived and therefore not representative of real-world biological variations. In addition, the noise added at each timepoint is independent of the other timepoints, which may not be the case in real-world data. The BioCycle Gauss dataset uses Gaussian processes to generate the data and address these problems. The datasets used in JTK_Cycle contain the following types of formulas or signals: cosine, cosine with outlier timepoints and white noise. The ARSER dataset contains cosine, damped cosine with an exponential trend, white noise and an auto-regressive process of order 1 (AR(1)). In addition to all the aforementioned signals, BioCycle Form contains also 9 additional kinds of signals: combined cosines (cosine2), cosine peaked, square wave, triangle wave, cosine with a linear trend, cosine with an exponential trend, cosine multiplied by an exponential, flat and linear signals (many of which can be found in<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Deckard et al., 2013</ref>).<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>shows an example of each type of signal found in the BioCycle Form dataset. For clarity, the periodic signals are shown without noise. Signals in the BioCycle Form dataset have an additional random offset chosen uniformly between À200 and 200, random amplitudes chosen uniformly between 1 and 100, signal to noise ratios (SNRs) of 1–5, random phases chosen uniformly between 0 and 2p, and periods between 20 and 28. [Data for the second (12 h) and third (8 h) harmonics, which are found in biological data, are also generated (<ref type="bibr">Supplementary Information)]</ref>. At each timepoint sample, zero mean Gaussian noise is added with the proper SNR variance. The BioCycle Gauss dataset is obtained from a Gaussian process. The value of the covariance matrix corresponding to the timepoints x and x 0 is determined by a kernel function kðx; x 0 Þ. Equation 1 is the kernel function used to generate the periodic signals, and Equation 2 is the kernel function used to generate the aperiodic signals in BioCycle Gauss .</p><formula>k p ðx; x 0 Þ ¼ exp Àsin 2 ðjp 1 p ðx À x 0 ÞjÞ 2l 2 ! þ r 2 dðx; x 0 Þ þ bxx 0 (1) k a ðx; x 0 Þ ¼ exp Àðx À x0Þ 2 2l 2 ! þ r 2 dðx; x 0 Þ (2)</formula><p>The parameter l controls how strong the covariance is between two different timepoints, r controls how noisy the synthetic data is, and b can add a non-stationary, linear, trend to the signals (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Duvenaud, 2014</ref>). The parameter p in equation 1 is the period of the signal. To generate the data in BioCycle Gauss, the values of l, r, b, p, as well as the offset and the scale are varied, in a way similar to the data in BioCycle Form. Examples of signals from the BioCycle Gauss dataset are given in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>. JTK_Cycle analyzes synthetic signals sampled over 48 h with a sampling frequency of 1 and 4 h. ARSER analyzes synthetic signals sampled over 44 h with a sampling frequency of 4 h. BioCycle analyzes synthetic signals sampled over 24 and 48 h. Signals sampled over 24 h have a sampling frequency of 4, 6 and an uneven sampling at timepoints 0, 5, 9, 14, 19 and 24. Signals sampled over 48 h have sampling frequencies of 4, 8 and an uneven sampling at timepoints 0, 4, 8, 13, 20, 24, 30, 36, 43. The sampling frequencies in these datasets are intentionally sparse to mimic the sparse temporal sampling of real-world high-throughput data. The number of synthetic signals at each sampling frequency is 1024 for JTK_Cycle, 20 000 for ARSER and 40 000 for BioCycle Synth. Finally, each signal in BioCycle Synth has three replicates, obtained by adding random Gaussian noise to the signal, to mimic typical biological experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">Biological data</head><p>The performance of any circadian rhythm detection method requires extensive validation on biological datasets. In previous work, due to the aforementioned difficulty of not having ground truth labels, the biological signals detected as being periodic had to be inspected by hand, or loosely assessed by comparison to other methods (<ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Straume, 2004</ref>). In addition to the scaling problems associated with manual inspection, this approach did not allow the computation of precise classification metrics (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Baldi et al., 2000</ref>), such as the AUC—the Area Under the Receive Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve. The repository of circadian data hosted on CircadiOmics (<ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Patel et al., 2012</ref>) includes over 30 high-throughput circadian transcriptomic studies, as well as several circadian high-throughput metabolomic</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Periodicity inference from time series measurements</head><p>3.1.1 Classifying between periodic and aperiodic signals To classify signals as periodic or aperiodic, we train deep neural networks (DNNs) using standard gradient descent with momentum (<ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Rumelhart et al., 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Sutskever et al., 2013</ref>). We train separate networks for data sampled over 24 and 48 h. The input to these networks are the expression time-series levels of the corresponding gene (or metabolite). The output is computed by a single logistic unit trained to be 1 when the signal is periodic and 0 otherwise, with relative entropy error function. We experimented with many hyperparameters and learning schedules. In the results reported, the learning rate starts at 0.01, and decays exponentially according to 0:1 1:000087 t , where t is the iteration number. The training set consists of 1 million examples, a size sufficient to avoid overfitting. The DNN uses a mini-batch size of 100 and is trained for 50 000 iterations. Use of dropout (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baldi and Sadowski, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Srivastava et al., 2014</ref>), or other forms of regularization, leads to no tangible improvements. The best performing DNN found (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5</ref>(a)) has 3 hidden layers of size 100. We are able to obtain very good results by training BIO_CYCLE on synthetic data alone and report test results obtained on BioCycle Form, BioCycle Gauss and BioCycle Real .Deep learning approaches for circadian rhythms i11</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Estimating the period</head><p>In a way similar to how we train DNNs to classify between periodic and aperiodic signals, we can also train DNNs to estimate the period of a signal classified as periodic. During training, only periodic time series are used as input to train these regression DNNs. The output of the DNNs are implemented using a linear unit and produce an estimated value for the period. The error function is the squared error between the output of the network and the true period of the signal, which is known in advance with synthetic data. Except for the difference in the output unit, we use the same DNNs architectures and hyperparameters as for the previous classification problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3">Estimating the phase and the lag</head><p>After the period p, we estimate the phase / of a signal s by finding the value / that maximizes the following expression: P t2T cosð 2pt p þ /Þs½t, where T is the set of all timepoints. Given /, the lag (i.e. at what time the periodic pattern starts) is given by /p 2p .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.4">Estimating the amplitude</head><p>After the phase /, we estimate the amplitude a by first removing any linear trend and then comparing the variance of the signal to the variance of a cosine signal with parameters /, p and amplitude 1.

An alternative is to measure the amplitude on the smoothed time series.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.5">Calculating P-values and q-values</head><p>To calculate P-values, the distribution of the null hypothesis must first be obtained. To do this, N aperiodic signals are generated from one of the two BioCycle Synth datasets. Then we calculate the N output values V(i) (i ¼ 1;. .. ; N) of the DNN on these aperiodic signals. The P-value for a new signal s with output value V is now 1 N X N i¼1 1ðV &gt; VðiÞÞ, where 1 is the indicator function. This equation provides an empirical frequency estimate for the probability of obtaining an output of size V or greater, assuming that the signal s comes from the null distribution (the distribution of aperiodic signals). Therefore, the smaller the P-value, the more likely it is that s is periodic. The q-values are obtained through the Benjamini and Hochberg procedure (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</ref>). We also compute a posterior probability of periodic expression (PPPE) using the method described in<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Allison et al. (2002)</ref>, which models the distribution of P-values as a mixture of beta distributions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Time inference from single timepoint measurements</head><p>For this task, different machine learning methods were investigated, including simple linear regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, shallow learning and deep learning, including unsupervised compressive autoencoders (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baldi, 2012</ref>) with two coupled phase (cosine/sine) units in the bottleneck layer (below and Supplementary Information). Supervised deep learning methods give the best results and are used in the final BIO_CLOCK system. The output of the DNNs is implemented using two coupled output units, representing the cosine and the sine of the phase angle (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5(b)</ref>). If the total weighted inputs into these two units are S 1 and S 2 respectively, then the values of the two outputs units are given by:</p><formula>S 1 = ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi S 2 1 þ S 2 2 q and S 2 = ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi S 2 1 þ S 2 2 q</formula><p>. These are then automatically converted into a time (ZT). In order to better assess the effect of having data from different tissues, we experiment with both training specialized predictors trained on data originating from a single tissue, as well as predictors trained on data from all tissues. The final general-purpose predictor corresponds to a DNN trained on all the data. In each one of these experiments, we use 5-fold cross validation on the corresponding subset of the BioClock dataset, using architectures with 2 to 9 layers, and 100 to 600 units, to select the best network. A learning rate of 0.1 is typically used, with an exponential decay according to 0:1 1:002 t. A visualization of the DNN is provided in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>(b).</p></div>

In addition, we compare to MetaCycle (MC) (<ref type="bibr">Wu et al., 2016</ref>). To identify periodic signals, ARSER uses autoregressive spectral estimation, Lomb-Scargle uses a periodogram, and JTK_Cycle uses the Jonckheere-Terpstra's and the Kendall's tau tests. MetaCycle combines ARSER, Lomb-Scargle and JTK_Cycle into one method. To determine if the BIO_CYCLE results are significantly different from other methods, the testing set is randomly split into 10 BIO_CYCLE. The output is either the binary periodic/aperiodic classification, or the regression estimate of the period of the signal. BIO_CLOCK. The outputs are the cosine and sine of the phase angle associated with the expression measurement of the core clock genes.equal-size, non-overlapping, subsets and the results from each subset are obtained. Then, a Student's t-test is performed between the results of the best of the two DNNs and the best of the previously existing methods. Finally, the P-value from that test is obtained to assess if the result differences are statistically significant. Small Pvalues (such as 0.05 and below) indicate that there is a significant difference between the methods. The P-values from the t-tests are shown in the rightmost column in all the tables. The results focus on periodic signals with periods around 24 h, the most common case, however periods of 12 and 8 h, corresponding to the second and third harmonics, are analyzed in the Supplementary Information. In the tables, the datasets BioCycle Form, BioCycle Gauss and BioCycle Real are referred to as BC F, BC G and BC R, respectively.</p><formula>(a) ( b)</formula></div>

The DNN F label corresponds to the DNN that has been trained on the BioCycle Form data, and the DNN G label corresponds to the DNN that has been trained on the BioCycle Gauss data. The ROC curves computed on BioCycle Gauss are similar (not shown). The results from<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>show that the DNN method has better AUC than all the other published methods on the BioCycle Form and BioCycle Gauss datasets. Though the DNN does better when tested on data from the same distribution as it was trained on, it still outperforms all the other previous methods, regardless of which data it is trained on. A plot showing how the signal to noise ratio (SNR) affects performance is shown in<ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>. This plot cannot be done for the BioCycle Gauss dataset, since in this case the exact SNR is not known. The DNN outperforms all the other published methods at all SNRs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.3">Evaluation of P-value cutoffs</head><p>To investigate if the p-values obtained by BIO_CYCLE are reasonable, the accuracy of the periodic/aperiodic classification at different p-value cutoffs is evaluated. In addition to a p-value, BIO_CYCLE produces a binary classification. If the output of the DNN is greater than 0.5 the signals is labeled as periodic, otherwise, it is labeled as aperiodic. The accuracy using this binary classification is also evaluated. Results are shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 8</ref>. The vertical dashed line corresponds to a common p-value cutoff of 0.05. However, a proper p-value does not guarantee that the best accuracy will be at the cutoff of 0.05. Results show that BIO_CYCLE has the highest potential accuracy. It also has the best accuracy at 0.05 for 2 out of the 4 plots. In addition, the binary classification of BIO_CYCLE is almost always better than the accuracy of all the other methods at any p-value cutoff. Histograms showing the p-values can be found in the Supplementary Information.</p></div>

Perfect prediction corresponds to y ¼ x and corresponds to R 2 ¼ 1. The results for estimating the period, lag and amplitude are shown in Tables 3–5, respectively. For the BioCycle Gauss dataset we cannot control or know the exact lag or amplitude, so there are no results for BioCycle Gauss in Tables 4 and 5. These tables tell a similar story as<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. The DNN outperforms the other methods in most of the categories.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Missing replicates and missing data</head><p>In gene expression experiments, replicate measurements can be missing. To investigate how missing replicates affect performance, the BioCycle Form dataset which has three replicates for each timepoint was used to assess performance with zero replicates removed at each timepoint, one replicate removed at each timepoint and two replicates removed at each timepoint. The results are shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 9</ref>and show that JTK_Cycle is significantly affected in a negative way by missing replicates, while the performance of all the other methods degrades gracefully with the number of missing replicates, and minimally compared to JTK_Cycle. Missing data (timepoints at which there are no replicates) is also handled gracefully by BIO_CYCLE, while it is not handled at all by some of the other methods (not shown).</p></div>

All the data is from mice and under WT condition. The only datasets for which we have enough data for training correspond to liver and brain (when aggregating all the corresponding datasets). We form two additional sets (Set 1 and Set 2) by combining data from other organs. The first corresponds to combined data from the adrenal gland, fat, gut, kidney, lung and muscle (Set 1). The second corresponds to combined data from the aorta, colon, fibroblast, heart, macrophages and pituitary gland (Set 2). Finally, all of the aforementioned data is combined to form a bigger dataset (All). In all the experiments reported in<ref type="figure">Table 6</ref>, the data are split using a 70/30 training/test ratio, and tests sets never overlap with any of the corresponding training sets. The DNNs perform best when trained and tested on the same organ/tissue or sets of organ/tissues or when trained on all the organs/tissues. The DNNs perform significantly worse when trained and tested on data with diverging origins. However, in all cases, the DNN trained on the combined dataset does almost as well as, or better than, the corresponding specialized DNN.</p><formula>(a) (c) (b) (d)</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>Deep learning methods can be applied to high-throughput circadian data to address important challenges in circadian biology. In particular, we have developed BIO_CYCLE to detect molecular species that oscillate in high-throughput circadian experiments and extract the characteristics of these oscillations. Remarkably, BIO_CYCLE can be trained with large quantities of synthetic data preventing any kind of overfitting. We have also developed BIO_CLOCK to infer the time at which a transcriptomic sample was collected from the level of expression of a small number of core clock genes. Both methods will be improved as more data becomes available and, more generally, deep learning methods are likely to be useful to address several other related circadian problems, such as analyzing periodicity in high-throughput circadian proteomic data, or inferring sample time in different species. In particular, developing methods for annotating the time of all the human gene expression experiments, contained in GEO, and other similar repositories, would be valuable. Such annotations could be important for improving the interpretation of both old and new data and discovering circadian driven effects that may be important in precision medicine and other applications, for instance to help determine the optimal time for administering certain drugs.</p><formula>(a) (c) ( d)</formula><p>(b)Deep learning approaches for circadian rhythms i17</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig.1.</head><figDesc>Fig. 1.

			<note place="foot">at :: on August 30, 2016 http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from studies, that provide extensive coverage of different tissues and experimental conditions. From the CircadiOmics data, a high-quality biological dataset BioCycle Real is created with periodic/aperiodic labels. To curate BioCycle Real, we start from 36 circadian microarray or RNA-seq transcriptome datasets, 32 of which are currently publicly available from the CircadiOmics web portal (28 of these are also available from CircaDB (Pizarro et al., 2012)). Five datasets are from ongoing studies and will be added to CircadiOmics upon completion. All included datasets correspond to experiments carried out in mice, with the exception of one dataset corresponding to measurements taken in Arabidopsis Thaliana. BioCycle Real comprises experiments carried over a: 24-h period with a 4 h sampling rate; 48-h period with a 2 h sampling rate; and 48-h period with a 1 h sampling rate. To extract from this set a high-quality subset of periodic time series, we focus on the time series associated with the core clock genes (Fig. 1) in the control experiments. These gene include Clock, Per1, Per2, Per3, Cyr1, Cry2, Nr1d1, Nr1d2, Bhlhe40, Bhlhe41, Dbp, Npas2 and Tel (Harmer et al., 2001) for mouse, and the corresponding orthologs in Arabidopsis (Harmer et al., 2000). Arabdiposis orthologs were obtained from Affymetrix NetAffx probesets and annotations (Liu et al., 2003). These core gene time series were further inspected manually to finally yield a set of 739 high-quality periodic signals. To extract a high-quality biological aperiodic dataset, we start from the same body of data. To identify transcripts unlikely to be periodic, we select the transcripts classified as aperiodic consistently by all three programs JTK_Cycle, ARSER and Lomb-Scargle with an associated P-value of 0.95. After further manual inspection, this yields a set of 18 094 aperiodic signals. Examples of signals taken at random from the BioCycle Real are shown in Figure 4. 2.2 Time inference from single timepoint measurements To estimate the time associated with a transcriptomic experiment conducted at a single timepoint, we curate the BioClock dataset starting from the same data in CircadiOmics, focusing on mouse data only for which we have enough training data. While in principle inference of the time can be done using the level of expression of all the genes, exploratory feature selection and data reduction experiments (not shown) show that in most cases it is sufficient to focus on the set of core clock genes, or even a subset (see Section 4). Thus the reduced BioClock dataset contains microarray and RNASeq single time measurements for each gene transcript in the core clock with the associated timepoint. The BioClock dataset is organized by tissue and condition. Tissues include liver, kidney, heart, colon, glands (pituitary, adrenal), skeletal muscle, bone, white fat and brown fat. Brain specific tissues include SCN (Suprachiasmatic nucleus), hippocampus, hypothalamus and cerebellum. There are also several cell-specific datasets including mouse fibroblasts and macrophages. All the datasets in BioClock contain both control and treatment conditions. There is great variability among the treatment conditions (e.g. Eckel-Mahan et al., 2013; Masri et al., 2014a), varying from gene knock out and knock down (SIRT1 and SIRT6), to changes in diet (high fat, ketogenic), to diseases (epilepsy). It is important to be able to assess the ability of a system to predict time across tissues and conditions. 3 Methods We experimented with several machine learning approaches for the two main problems considered here. In general, the best results were obtained using neural networks. This is perhaps not too surprising since it is well known that neural networks have universal approximation properties and deep learning has led to state-of-the art performance, not only in several areas of engineering (e.g. computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, robotics) (Hannun et al., 2014; Lenz et al., 2015; Szegedy et al., 2014), but also in the natural sciences (Baldi et al., 2014; Di Lena et al., 2012; Lusci et al., 2013; Quang et al., 2015). Thus here we focus exclusively on deep learning approaches to build two systems, BIO_CYCLE and BIO_CLOCK, to address the two main problems. However, we add comparisons to k-nearest neighbors and Gaussian processes in the Supplementary Information.</note>

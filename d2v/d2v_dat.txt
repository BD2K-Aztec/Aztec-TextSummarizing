Although ad hoc software tools exist for the feature matching, the definition of a combinatorial model for this problem is still not available.
An immediate one is that the final outcome of the algorithms is unpredictable without running the software on a specific input.

Availability: http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/software.
introduction in the past decades, considerable effort has been devoted to the development of algorithms for the alignment of biological sequences at the nucleotide or amino acid level.
Therefore, most multiple sequence alignment (MSA) tools are based on progressive alignment, in which N sequences are aligned through N 1 applications of a pairwise alignment algorithm, usually guided by a tree that determines the order in which the sequences are combined.
The proposed alignment algorithm is part of the iterative automatic detection of homologous regions iad hore software (), a map based method to detect homologous genomic segments within or between the genomes of related organisms.
